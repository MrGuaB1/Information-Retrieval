history of sarcocystis history of the discovery of sarcocystosis 2 the white threadlike sarcocysts were once called miescher's tubules sarcocysts were first isolated by the swiss scientist friedrich miescher in 1843 when examining a house mouse miescher discovered white threadlike structures sarcocysts in its muscle tissue these cysts came to be called miescher's tubules for many years after their discovery over the next few decades similar cysts were found in other animals such as pigs but it was not until 1889 when they were finally given a name sarcocystis miescheriana 2 as much was still unknown about the organism scientists were unsure whether to classify the species as protozoa or as fungi since only the sarcocyst stage had been identified at that time however in 1967 through the use of electron microscopes bradyzoites crescent shaped structures found in several protozoa were found in sarcocyst cultures and the debate was resolved 2 remaining stages of the sarcocystis life cycle were discovered in 1970 after experiments showed the development of bradyzoites into oocytes following a sexual stage various studies throughout the years have revealed that hundreds of sarcocystis species can be found in different animals which can act as both intermediate and definitive hosts for the parasite in fact even reptiles have been identified as intermediate hosts for sarcocystis as early as 1892 5 additionally though sarcocystosis is rare among humans sarcocysts were first discovered in humans in laryngeal muscle cells in 1894 6 copyright 2006 aliyya haque
