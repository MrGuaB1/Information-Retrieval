stanford linguistics colloquium 30 may 1997 particle ellipsis and focus projection in japanese shuichi yatabe tokyo university and stanford university in this talk i will examine the properties of particle ellipsis in japanese in hopes of discovering some general principles governing the distribution of focus the nominative case particle in japanese ga is omissible under certain circumstances as in the sentence taiyoo ga detekita the sun came out the descriptive goal of this talk is to determine exactly under what circumstances the particle is allowed to be absent authors such as tsutsui tateishi and kageyama have made claims such as the following the particle is harder to drop when it marks an agentive np the particle is harder to drop when it marks the subject of an individual level predicate the particle is harder to drop when the particle is not adjacent to a predicate these seem to be fairly adequate descriptions of observed tendencies but there are exceptions to each of these generalizations as has been pointed out in the previous literature in this talk i will first argue that particle ellipsis in japanese is subject to what i will call the antifocus constraint a constraint which prohibits ellipsis of a particle when either the np marked by that particle or its head noun is focused an expression is said to be focused when it is interpreted as contrasting with some other object of the same type then making use of some intonational facts noted by selkirk tateishi kori and others i will argue that the antifocus constraint alone captures all the facts that the three generalizations listed above are intended to capture in other words it will be my claim that the distribution of focus within a sentence and not just the distribution of prosodic prominence is affected by the internal semantic makeup of the sentence
