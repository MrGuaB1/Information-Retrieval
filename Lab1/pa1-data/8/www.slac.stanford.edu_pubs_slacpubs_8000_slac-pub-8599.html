slac pub 8599 impedance of a beam tube with small corrugations slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8599 impedance of a beam tube with small corrugations abstract in accelerator projects involving the use of very short bunches such as the linac coherent light source lcls where the rms bunch length in the undulator section is 30 microns it appears that even submicron imperfections in the beam tube surface can generate an impedance that is unacceptably large we consider two periodic models of an imperfect rough surface one with small rectangular corrugations the other with smooth sinusoidal oscillations we compare the impedance of these two models and apply the results to the lcls parameters full text pdf slac pub 8599 127 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8599 52.9 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
