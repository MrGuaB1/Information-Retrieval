slac pub 7805 high gradient cavity beat wave accelerator at w band slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7805 high gradient cavity beat wave accelerator at w band abstract pulsed rf heating is a fundamental limit on high gradient acceleration in copper structures reduction of pulsed heating is favored by a short exposure time for the copper yet in conventional accelerators efficiency requires an exposure time of order a cavity fill time at w band the cavity beat wave transformer concept permits efficient energy transfer to resonant accelerating modes on a sub nanosecond time scale we re examine this acceleration scheme as it appears at w band with attention to drive beam dynamics full text pdf slac pub 7805 28.2 kb compressed postscript slac pub 7805 28.4 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
