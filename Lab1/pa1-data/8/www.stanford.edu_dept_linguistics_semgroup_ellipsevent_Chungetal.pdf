sluicing between structure and inference sandra chung william ladusaw and james mccloskey investigations of sluicing since ch page 1 sluicing between structure and inference sandra chung william ladusaw and james mccloskey investigations of sluicing since chung ladusaw and mccloskey 1995 have profitably explored two approaches to this ellipsis process that differ significantly from ours in one the ellipsis site is created by deletion of a fully articulated tp in which wh movement has applied in the other the ellipsis site contains no internal structure at all and its reference is resolved via pragmatic inference here we reconsider some of the theoretical issues focusing on sprouting the subtype of sluicing in which the remnant of ellipsis has no overt correlate in the antecedent clause we discuss evidence some of it new which suggests that sprouting involves the re use of existing material much as we originally proposed
