stanford cs345a data mining by jure leskovec stanford university stanford home course info announcements course outline handouts assignments projects resources cs345a data mining winter 2010 assignments there will be assignments of two kinds gradiance assignments some of the homework will be on the gradiance system you should go there to open your account and enter the class token 78bc2889 if you have taken cs145 or cs245 within the past year your account for that class should grant you free access for cs345 if not you will have to purchase the access on line note if you have to purchase access use either garcia widom ullman 2nd edition or ullman widom 3rd edition the books used for 145 and 245 do not purchase access to the tan steinbach kumar materials even though the title is data mining you can try the work as many times as you like and we hope everyone will eventually get 100 the secret is that each of the questions involves a long answer problem which you should work the gradiance system gives you random right and wrong answers each time you open it and thus samples your knowledge of the full problem while there are ways to game the system we group several questions at a time so it is hard to get 100 without actually working the problems also notice that you have to wait 10 minutes between openings so brute force random guessing will not work solutions appear after the problem set is due however you must submit at least once so your most recent solution appears with the solutions embedded challenge problems these are more complex problems for which written solutions are requested they will be lightly graded meaning that we shall accept any reasonable attempt and those doing exceptionally well will get extra credit but there will not be exact numerical grades assigned assignments assignment1 challenge problem 1 solutions past due was due on feb 2 11.59 pm challenge problem 2 solutions past due was due on feb 15 11.59 pm challenge problem 3 due on mar 8 11.59 pm
