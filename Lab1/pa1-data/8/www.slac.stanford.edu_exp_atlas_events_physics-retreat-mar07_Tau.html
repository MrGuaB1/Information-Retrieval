tau sub group slac physics analysis retreat tau sub group this page provides information about the tau related projects that people will be working on during the workshop topics documentation topics tau trigger efficiency evaluate and understand the current tau trigger efficiency at all levels of the trigger study the effect of using the trigger in combination with other signatures current ideas include combining the tau trigger with a missing et trigger other lepton triggers and a two tau trigger develop a plan for evaluating trigger efficiency contact person eric torrence tau trigger validation comparing quantities measured at l2 and the event filter eta phi momentum develop rtt tests contact person david strom tau trigger timing studies measuring the time it takes l2 and event filter algorithms and reconstruction to run checking steering reconstruction caching tracking down problematic events contact person sarah demers tau id physics study measure tau id efficiency in ttbar events and compare with the id efficiency in w and z events estimate signal and background levels for identifying taus ttbar events see if this channel is reasonable for measuring the tau id efficiency with the data contact person sarah demers tau documentation and tutorials tau trigger wiki tau trigger validation wiki tau reconstruction taurec tau reconstruction tau1p3p 12.0 6 tau trigger aware analysis tutorial
