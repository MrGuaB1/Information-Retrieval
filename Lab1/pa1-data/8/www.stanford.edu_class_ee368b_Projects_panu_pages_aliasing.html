aliasing effect home previous next 4 aliasing effect in the previous section we do not use any filter to reduce high frequency component of the image this may result in aliasing effect in the subsampled images which leads to a problem in progressive transmission to illustrate this effect consider the following extreme image zone test image this is an image of a sine wave with increasing frequency from top left to bottom right next consider the images in the gaussian pyramid in the previous two sections g 1 g 2 g 3 burt adelson pyramid g 1 g 2 g 3 nonlinear prediction pyramid in section3 notice that linear low pass filter gives less aliasing especially at higher level in the pyramid now we see that each filter has its own advantage and disadvantage in the next section we shall introduce a method to combine these filters home previous next
