guest editorial page 1 2 winter 1995 guest editorial the lead article in this issue of the beam line is martin perl's descrip tion of the discovery of the tau lep ton the story goes back to the mid 1970s at a time when the spear electron positron storage ring at slac had recently come into operation and a joint slac lbl collabora tion was using its pioneering solenoidal de tector and track reconstruction algorithms in the early experimental program the two mile long linear accelerator came into being largely through the efforts of pief panofsky slac's first director burt richter slac's present director was largely responsible for spear martin perl was one of very few team members who approached our experiment at spear with a definite goal to find a heavy lepton other approaches were more in the bubble chamber tradition of analyzing the data and following the clues revealed by the analyses as circumstance would have it both approaches met with remarkable success during the brief period that the original slac lbl solenoidal magnetic detector mark i was operational from 1973 to 1977 our experiment was arguably one of the most productive in the history of particle physics we discovered the psi the psi prime and gerson goldhaber is now professor in the graduate school university of california at berkeley and faculty staff sci entist emeritus at the lawrence berkeley laboratory lbl he was co group leader with george trilling at lbl when they joined willie chinowsky of lbl and martin perl and burton richter's groups at the stanford linear accelerator center to build the spear solenoidal detector this collabo ration lasted from 1971 to 1990 moving from spear to pep and then to the slc for the discovery of charmed mesons he received the 1977 california scientist of the year award and in 1991 the panofsky prize of the american physical society shared wtih francois pierre since 1990 he has been working with saul perlmutter at lbl in a search of the most distant supernovae the supernova cosmology pro ject has by now observed 27 supernovae mostly type ia that can be used as standard candles the aim of the exper iment is to measure the deceleration parameter of the universe but this is a topic for a future beam line article lbl photographic services page 2 beam line 3 their quantum numbers the decays of psi prime to psi the radiative decays of the psi the chi states the first one observed at desy and general psion spectroscopy the evidence for quark jets beam polarization leading to spin 1 2 quarks the anomalous electron muon events that became the tau lepton as described in the following article and the d mesons that proved what some theorists had suspected all along that the j psi was a bound state of charmed quarks it was in mid 1975 in the wake of the psion spectroscopy beam polarization quark jets one thrill a week that martin came to berkeley to tell our half of the collaboration about his observations he told us about his 24 electron muon events sometimes known as perl's pearls and about his meticulous study of backgrounds and why he thought these events represented the decay of a pair of new particles the initial reaction of the collaboration was interest blended with skepticism as soon as i had a few hours to spare from all the other exciting projects i studied these events using my own criteria and i convinced myself that they were indeed real and that martin had observed anom alous lepton production what was more difficult to believe was that these electron muon events were actually the decay products of new particles and in particular the heavy leptons that martin had set out to find rather than simply some phenomenon related to the j psi system that was then un der study in precisely the same energy region with gary feldman's active participation martin persisted and together they found the corresponding anomalous muon pairs with the discovery of the d mesons in may 1976 it became clear that whatever it was that martin had found had nothing to do with the long sought charmed meson it is amusing that when the muon was dis covered it was at first confused with the then predicted yukawa meson the pion and indeed the masses are rather close this situ ation again repeated itself with the tau lep ton and the d meson as shown in the following article martin was indeed correct and those who at first doubted his interpretation have long since become believers among the believers are the members of the nobel selection commit tee who have chosen martin perl to share the 1995 nobel prize in physics for his dis covery of the tau lepton a fascinating story read on gerson goldhaber
