abstract bio stanford ee computer systems colloquium 4 15pm wednesday march 14 2007 hp auditorium gates computer science building b01 http ee380 stanford edu a new balancing method for solving parametric maximum flow problems bin zhang hp labs about the talk a new simple and fast algorithm finds a sequence of nested minimum cuts of a bipartite parametric flow network instead of working with the original parametric flow network the new method works with a derived non parametric flow network and finds a particular state of the flows in the derived network in a single scan of the flows in this special state the sequence of nested minimum cuts of the original parametric flow network can be written out the models this new method can solve cover a number of interesting real world problems slides download the slides for this presentation in pdf format about the speaker bin zhang has a bs and ms in mathematics from nankai university and a ph d in computer science from harvard university he has close to 20 years experience in industrial research and development after joining hp labs he designed computer algorithms in the areas of data mining and information management contact information bin zhang bin zhang2 hp com
