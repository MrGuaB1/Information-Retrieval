stanford linguistics colloquium 11 may 2001 syntactic integration difficulty in language comprehension edward gibson mit department of brain and cognitive sciences in this presentation i will present evidence from my lab which evaluates distance based theories of language comprehension in the process of understanding a sentence it is necessary to integrate structures for incoming words into the structure s that have been built thus far such that the potential integrations for an incoming word are determined by the syntactic rules for the language according to one current theory the dependency locality theory dlt gibson 1998 2000 the processing cost of integrating a new word w is proportional to the distance between w and the syntactic head to which w is being integrated structural integration cost has been shown to be an important factor in accounting for on line processing load the first set of experiments that i will present provide evidence for distance based complexity from reading time studies of a range of english sentence types the second set of experiments investigates the question of how distance is quantified our evidence suggests that the discourse accessibility of the intervening elements may be a large component of the distance computation the final experiments to be discussed investigate the neural basis of syntactic integration difficulty using event related potentials erps references gibson e 1998 linguistic complexity locality of syntactic dependencies cognition 68 1 76 gibson e 2000 the dependency locality theory a distance based theory of linguistic complexity in miyashita y marantz a & o neil w eds image language brain pp 95 126 cambridge ma mit press kaan e harris a gibson e & holcomb p 2000 the p600 as an index of syntactic integration difficulty language and cognitive processes 15 159 201
