ee282 computer systems architecture ee282 computer systems architecture spring 2010 2011 jacob leverich dr nate binkert and dr partha ranganathan course description ee282 focuses on advanced system level architecture techniques for devices such as personal computers servers and embedded or portable systems it covers topics such as cache hierarchies memory systems storage and io systems virtualization clusters fault tolerance and low power design it also covers the interactions between the hardware and software layers in such systems the programming assignments provide an introduction to performance analysis and optimization techniques for computer systems at the completion of the course you will understand basic principles such as locality coarse grain parallelism overlapping communication and computation performance power trade offs and reliability overall you will understand how computer systems are organized and more importantly why they are organized that way ee282 discusses the characteristics of modern processors that affect system architecture but does not provide detailed coverage of their internal microarchitecture see ee382a ee282 is appropriate for graduate and advanced undergraduate students specializing in the broad field of computer systems it is also appropriate for other ee and cs students who want to understand program and make efficient use of modern computer systems in their day to day work ee108b or an equivalent class is a prerequisite students are expected to have programming experience with c c++ or other similar languages lecture time & location monday & wednesday 11 00am 12 15pm gates b01 review section time & location friday 11 00am 11 50am gates b03 online access lectures available online through scpd info videos
