simpio h simpio h this interface exports a set of functions that simplify input output operations in c++ and provide some error checking on console input functions getinteger prompt reads a complete line from cin and scans it as an integer getreal prompt reads a complete line from cin and scans it as a floating point number getline prompt reads a line of text from cin and returns that line as a string function detail int getinteger string prompt reads a complete line from cin and scans it as an integer if the scan succeeds the integer value is returned if the argument is not a legal integer or if extraneous characters other than whitespace appear in the string the user is given a chance to reenter the value if supplied the optional prompt string is printed before reading the value usage int n getinteger prompt double getreal string prompt reads a complete line from cin and scans it as a floating point number if the scan succeeds the floating point value is returned if the input is not a legal number or if extraneous characters other than whitespace appear in the string the user is given a chance to reenter the value if supplied the optional prompt string is printed before reading the value usage double x getreal prompt string getline string prompt reads a line of text from cin and returns that line as a string the newline character that terminates the input is not stored as part of the return value if supplied the optional prompt string is printed before reading the value usage string line getline prompt
