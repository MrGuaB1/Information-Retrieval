slac pub 7896 inclusive search for b s gluon slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7896 inclusive search for b s gluon abstract we describe an inclusive search for flavor changing neutral current decays of the type b s gluon in the sld experiment models of b s gluon indicate that the production of high momentum kaons is enhanced over background from standard b decays if the branching ratio for b s gluon is 10 then such an enhancement should have a good signal to background ratio the analysis makes use of the particle identification and high precision vertexing capabilities of sld to search for such an enhancement the data sample consists of 300k hadronic z 0 decays collected between 1993 and 1997 full text pdf slac pub 7896 282 kb compressed postscript slac pub 7896 118 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
