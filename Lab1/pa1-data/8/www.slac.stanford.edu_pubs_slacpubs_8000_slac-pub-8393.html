slac pub 8393 image current heating on metal surface due to charged bunches slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8393 image current heating on metal surface due to charged bunches abstract when charged particles pass through a metal pipe they are accompanied by an image current on the metal surface with intense short bunches passing near the metal surface the peak image current density can be very high this current may result in substantial temperature rise on the surface especially in multi bunch operation in this paper we derive an explicit formula for the surface temperature rise due to this previously unrecognized effect and show that it should be taken into account in structure and collimator design for future accelerators full text pdf slac pub 8393 226 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8393 234 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
