mou appendix a appendix a scope of project participation and use of unix spires by _________________________________________ to accompany stanford linear accelerator center slac _________________________________ mou participation in an agreement for the testing and enhancement of unix spires a first year scope of participation and cost sharing assessment the first year cost sharing for participation in the agreement provides site installation and also some expert assistance in how to migrate from mainframe to unix spires as well as the software upgrades and benefits outlined in the accompanying mou first year participation cost sharing is $9800 us for the first installation and $6500 us for additional installations performed within that first year for the purposes of this document an installation means one compiled copy of the code and its component programs on a single host machine during the first year unlimited access to and use of unix spires on that host machine are permitted to _________________________________________'s personnel and users b continuing participation and cost sharing assessment institutions wishing to continue using the unix spires compiled code must be active participants in the unix spires agreement on an annual basis there are two levels of annual participation available depending upon the database s size and the number of applications that will be using unix spires because slac is non profit and desires simply to off set the ongoing costs for development maintenance and support the costs of this project have been kept as low as possible determination of the appropriate level of continuing membership will be on the honor system institutions participating in the spires hep collaboration by running a mirror site for the spires hep databases maintain their continuing participation at the standard level 1 cost sharing for continued participation at a standard level a standard participation cost sharing level after the first year will be $6500 us annually and will permit the continued use of unix spires with upgrades and fixes for twelve more calendar months standard participation is defined as an installation running either a large database requiring unlimited searching updating and development or one which is running more than one database unix spires files institutions which become standard level participants in the first year will receive a production version of the web interface when it is released 2 cost sharing for continued participation at a restricted level restricted participation at a reduced amount is available to institutions needing a unix spires database management system for a single small spires database an example of restricted participation might be a single bibliographic file with a modest user base and a single developer which is not under heavy growth or development the annual cost sharing for continuing unix spires participation at a restricted participant level is $3300 us this level of participation would entitle the institution to the continued use of the current unix spires installation with no upgrades but with any essential fixes for twelve more calendar months while intended for a single database with limited size maintenance development and use the restricted level participation permits unlimited search access to the database by a modest user base significantly increased database development growth or use or the need to develop additional databases unix spires files would require notification of slac and an increase of that institution's cost sharing to the standard level for that year c scope of participation ____________________________________________________ has read and understood the intended participation levels above and has determined to the best of its knowledge that the following scope of participation is appropriate to the use s to which it intends to put unix spires ____ first year agreement 1 number of separate installations desired _________ 2 first year cost sharing us 9800 for first installation 6500 for each additional installation total payment _______________ _____ continuing year agreement 1 standard participation level continuing year cost sharing us 6500 for primary installation 3300 for each additional installation total payment _______________ 2 restricted participation level continuing year cost sharing us 3300 for primary installation total payment _______________ d signed for _________________________________________________ by signature date 8 march 2005 pkreitz slac stanford edu
