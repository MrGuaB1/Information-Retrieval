untitled document public health and prevention strategies figure 18 the necessary canine factor in human dirofilariasis infections 17 more danger for human infections exists with the continued prevalence of dog infections worldwide by reducing the amount of disease present in dogs humans are less at risk for contraction of dirofilariasis in south america success has already been demonstrated with the reduction of heartworm infections across many countries this can be attributed to better control programs for mosquito populations resulting in a decrease in vector populations effective chemoprophylaxis for heartworm to prevent increase in number of disease carriers reduction of disease carriers with injectable ivermectin to kill existing microfilariae in dog populations side effect reduction of reproductive capacity of worms from ehrlichiosis control with tetracyclines figure 19 number of microfilariae in blood can be killed by microfilaricides 16 in order to reduce dog and human d immitis infections worldwide a variety of methods can be used preventing infection in dogs can be done by daily administration of diethylcarbamazine during and after heartworm season macrocyclic lactone ml is a parasiticide that prevents heartworm as well as other intestinal and external parasites this reduces new infections by reducing the number of microfilariae circulating in peripheral blood of dogs available for consumption by mosquitoes ivermectin milbemycin and selamectin all block development of larvae which also decreases the infection rate of new individuals reduce mosquito bites in humans by applying repellants and wearing protective clothing walking dogs earlier in evening before mosquitoes become active also reduces the number of bites reduce mosquito vector populations in urban areas by using mosquito larvicides or biological control like larvae eating fish species
