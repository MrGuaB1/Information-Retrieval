thread h thread h this interface exports a simple platform independent thread abstraction along with simple tools for concurrency control classes thread the thread class encapsulates a lightweight process running in the same address space as the creator lock this class represents a simple lock used to control concurrency statement synchronized lock defines a critical section protected by the specified lock functions fork fn fork fn data creates a child thread that calls fn in an address space shared with the current thread join thread waits for the specified thread to finish before proceeding yield yields the processor to allow another thread to run getcurrentthread returns the currently executing thread statement detail synchronized lock defines a critical section protected by the specified lock the general strategy for using this facility is shown in the following paradigmatic pattern synchronized lock statements in the critical section function detail thread fork void fn thread fork void fn clienttype & data clienttype & data creates a child thread that calls fn in an address space shared with the current thread the second form makes it possible to pass an argument to fn which may be of any type usage thread child fork fn thread child fork fn data void join thread & thread waits for the specified thread to finish before proceeding usage join thread void yield yields the processor to allow another thread to run usage yield thread getcurrentthread returns the currently executing thread usage thread self getcurrentthread
