drucunculiasis morphology 1 dracunculus medinensis is one of the largest known nematodes and is the largest to infect humans 2 with adult females reaching a length of up to 800mm but with much smaller adult males rarely exceeding 40mm and 2mm wide 3 the males have unequal spicules needle like structures ranging from 490 to 730 um in length the gubernaculums the connecting cord between scrotum range from 115 to 130 um and genital papillae vary considerably in published descriptions 4 the worms have a small triangular mouth with no lips surrounded by a quadrangular sclerotized plate at about the same level as the amphids an outer circle of four double cephalic on the head papillae surrounds an inner circle of two double papillae peculiar because they are dorsal and ventral each worm possesses an esophagus with a large protruding glandular portion that lies alongside the thin muscular portion 5 young females have a relatively equatorial vulva that becomes atrophied and nonfunctional in the adult stage females also have a gravid uterus with both an anterior and posterior branch filled with nearly three million embryos 6 the weight of this uterus places excessive pressure on the intestine rendering it nonfunctional 7 8 9
