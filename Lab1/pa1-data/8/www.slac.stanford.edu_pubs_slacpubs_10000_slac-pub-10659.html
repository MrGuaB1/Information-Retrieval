slac pub 10659 beam beam performance of the slac b factory slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 10659 beam beam performance of the slac b factory abstract the beam beam performance of pep ii has been monitored by parasitic measurements recorded during routine physics running and by a few dedicated accelerator physics experiments these measurements indicate that in some cases the beam beam interaction and the electron cloud induced blowup of the low energy positron beam are somehow coupled and enhance each other tailoring the bunch pattern to carefully balance these effects has proven very effective in maximizing the integrated luminosity the comparison of recent simulation results with experimental data is encouraging full text pdf slac pub 10659 420 kb compressed postscript not available for this document more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 18 aug 2004 11 32 pdt by htmlme pl
