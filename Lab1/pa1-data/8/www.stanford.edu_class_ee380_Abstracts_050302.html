abstract bio computer systems laboratory colloquium 4 15pm wednesday march 02 2005 nec auditorium gates computer science building b03 http ee380 stanford edu transistor scaling and its impact on analog rf device performance kelin j kuhn portland technology development intel corporation about the talk over the last three decades microprocessors have demonstrated performance improvements of greater than five orders of magnitude it is no secret that these improvements have largely been enabled by transistor scaling however it is less clear if transistor scaling also enables performance improvements for analog and rf circuits this talk explores the benefits and costs of applying conventional transistor scaling to analog and rf devices about the speaker kelin kuhn is the device manager for the intel 45nm cmos technology being developed at the portland technology development center dr kuhn joined the intel corporation in 1997 and since joining intel has held a variety of technical positions on the 0.35 um 130nm and 90nm nodes including most recently serving as the integration manager for the rf analog derivative technology on 90nm prior to joining intel dr kuhn was a tenured faculty member in the dept of elec and comp engineering at the university of washington she received the bs in electrical engineering from the university of washington in 1980 and the ms and ph d in electrical engineering from stanford university in 1985 dr kuhn is the author of numerous technical publications on optical and electronic properties of semiconductor devices as well as author of the text laser engineering contact information kelin j kuhn
