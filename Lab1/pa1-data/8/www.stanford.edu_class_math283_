math 283 home math 283 winter 2012 home syllabus contents course description and prerequisites instructor books and other resources tentative list of topics course description and prerequisites math 283 is a graduate course in the cohomology of finite groups group cohomology deals with obtaining invariants of groups coming from the cohomology of their classifying spaces these computations often have a topological and an algebraic interpretation and have applications both in topology and group theory in topology group cohomology is used to study possible actions of groups invariants of spaces with group actions obstructions and principal bundles and it is connected to steenrod operations in group theory and algebra it can be used to classify group extensions to determine the projectivity of modules and to study modular representations this is a subject with deep interconnections of algebra and topology with well known classical results and modern applications formal prerequisites are basic knowledge of group theory math 120 for example and a course in algebraic topology about the fundamental group homology and cohomology such as math 215b knowledge of higher homotopy groups and related results as in math 282b is recommended but not strictly necessary apart from formal prerequisites i will assume that you are familiar with basic homological algebra for a tentative list of topics that may be covered go here for the list of topics actually covered go to the syllabus page instructor jose cantarero instructor wf 10 30 11 45am in 420 147 office 380 382b office hours tuesdays 10 11am wednesdays 1 45 3 45pm shared with math 215b or by appointment email cantarer at stanford dot edu books and other resources we will be following some parts of the books and articles listed below this list will be updated as the course goes on a complete list of references for each day's lecture will also be posted on the syllabus page cohomology of groups by ks brown cohomology of finite groups by a adem and rj milgram representations and cohomology i by dj benson representations and cohomology ii by dj benson tentative list of topics group cohomology from the viewpoint of homological algebra resolutions group rings ext and tor group cohomology from the viewpoint of algebraic topology classifying spaces principal bundles aspherical spaces applications of low dimensional cohomology group extensions crossed modules restriction transfer and norm maps primary decomposition steenrod operations kan extensions free actions of groups on spheres actions of groups on lattices of subgroups fusion systems and p local groups winter 2012 department of mathematics stanford university problems with this page contact your instructor so that he can fix the problem
