slac pub 7826 missing title slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7826 missing title abstract we have measured the b hadron energy distribution in z 0 decays using a new technique applied to a sample of inclusive b decays recorded in the sld experiment at slac between 1996 and 1997 the upgraded ccd vertex detector is used to reconstruct b decay vertices with high efficiency and purity and to provide precise measurements of the kinematic quantities used in this technique for each reconstructed b decay vertex the part of the b energy missing from the vertex is derived from the kinematic quantities b vertices with low missing mass are selected to provide a very high purity sample and to obtain good energy resolution we compare the scaled b hadron energy distribution with the predictions of several qcd and phenomenological models of heavy quark fragmention the average scaled energy x b is measured to be 0.719 0.005 stat 0.001 unfolding preliminary full text pdf slac pub 7826 737 kb compressed postscript slac pub 7826 167 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file created from latex source which may have used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification though the fonts will be legible at slightly higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the type 3 fonts such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
