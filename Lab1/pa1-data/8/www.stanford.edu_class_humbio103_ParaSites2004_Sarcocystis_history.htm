history of discovery history sarcocystosis was described for the first time by friedrich miescher in 1843 when it was discovered in skeletal tissue of domestic house mice mus musculus the cysts were originally termed miescher's tubules after their discoverer sarcocysts were also referred to as milky white threads the genus was later considered for the first time by lankester in 1882 johann friedrick meischer his father first described sarcocystis johann discovered the nucleic acids of dna the heteroxenous parasite needs more than one host for development life cycle remained obscure until 1972 when the life cycle was finally made clear when it was found that the predator prey relationship of the intermediate and definitive hosts is key today over 200 species have been named and more continue to be found making sarcocystis an ubiquitous parasite for mammals especially sheep pigs and cattle reptiles and birds human infection whereby the human is the definitive host is attributable to two species of sarcocystis s bovihominis and s suihominis originally however human sarcocystis was named after lindemann who first described the parasite in humans although the parasites lindemann observed may not have actually been sarcocystis spp historically the sexual stages of s bovihominis and s suihominis were confused with species of isospora and were collectively thought to be isospora hominis today this name can still be used as a synonym for the infection isospora hominis infection caused by human infecting species of sarcocystis copyright 2004 stephanie adams prepared for parasites and pestilence dr scott smith created 23 may 2004
