erasure decoding message passing page 1 ee388 modern coding theory erasure decoding andrea montanari lecture 3 4 4 6 2010 this homework is about decoding regular ldpc codes over the erasure channel message passing consider a code with factor graph g each node either check or variable is a little processing unit nodes exchange messages along edges with the objective of decoding the transmitted codeword messages are elements of an alphabet m that you are free to choose at your convenience at any given time a node can only use the messages it received so far and if it is the variable node the channel output at its position for the sake of simplicity we ll assume that nodes are perfectly synchronized at each iteration all variable nodes send out messages and then all check nodes and so on consider now decoding a message transmitted over the bec  assume the degree of g is bounded by d and the alphabet size m to be finite how many operations does it take to run t iterations is there a way to implement the peeling decoder in the above model consider now a further restriction the message sent at any time from node i to node a only depends on messages reaching i at the previous iteration from other nodes is it still possible to implement the peeling decoder a j j a b k in the previous what would you use as a stopping criterion after how many iterations will the algorithm stop under this criterion suppose you had to implement a message passing procedure on your computer which data structure would you use to store the graph g 1 page 2 density evolution let xt 0 1 be the probability that a uniformly random message from variable to check nodes is wrong after t iterations in the limit n this satisfies the recursive equation xt 1  1 1 xt k 1 l 1 1 with initial condition x0  what can you say about this recursion 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 figure 1 density evolution for the 3 6 ensemble over the erasure channel left  0.4 right  0.45 let  z zl 1 and  z zk 1 then the recursion can be written as xt 1  1  1 xt 2 or  1 xt 1  1  1 xt 3 represent this last form of the recursion graphically notice that 1 0  x dx  l 1 0  x dx 1 k 4 interpret these identities graphically what do they imply summary at the end of this week you should know 1 what is a message passing decoder 2 how to implement an optimal message passing decoder for the erasure channel 3 how to detemine the corresponding threshold erasure probability this material and some more can be found in sections 3.5 3.9 3.12 of mct 2 page 3 work generate random codes from the 3 6 ensemble with blocklength n 100 1000 10000 get rid of double edges in your favourite way implement the message passing version of the peeling algorithm evaluate the bit error probability curves for communication over the bec  compare them with the density evolution threshold  i expect to receive 1 a print out of the program you used 2 a plot of error probability curves versus  for the three blocklengths 3 a three lines description of the following features of your simulation how many channel realizations did you use how many values of  did you simulate how much cpu time did the simulation take for each value of  and for each size 3
