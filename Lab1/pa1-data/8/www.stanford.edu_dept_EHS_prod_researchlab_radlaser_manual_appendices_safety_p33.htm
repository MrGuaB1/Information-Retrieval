radiation safety manual 1997 radiation safety manual 1997 up h 3 c 14 p 32 p 33 s 35 cr 51 i 125 u nat p 33 radionuclide safety data sheet nuclide p 33 forms all soluble physical characteristics half life 25 days type decay beta maximum energy 0.248 mev hazard category c level low hazard 0.1 to 20 mci b level moderate hazard 20 to 1 ci a level high hazard greater than 1 ci external radiation hazards and shielding the maximum range of these betas is 19 inches in air and 0.009 inches 0.23 mm in glass the external hazard of this isotope is minimal eg the glass vial holding the isotope will provide sufficient shielding to stop the betas if skin is uniformly contaminated with p 33 1 micro curie cm 2 will deliver a dose of 3200 mrem hr to basal cells of the skin porter consultants to nrc based upon 0.257 mev max beta particles hazards if internally deposited the alara annual limit of intake ali based on nrc which would deliver 500 mrems to the whole body is 600 m ci note the hazards from ingestion or internal deposition of p 33 in labeled nucleotide bases may be greater than for inorganic phosphates dosimetry and bioassay requirements film badges and dosimeter rings are of marginal value inappropriate for monitoring p 33 exposure urine assays may be required after spills or contamination incidents special problems and precautions always wear protective gloves to keep contamination from skin change gloves often p 33 beta particles have very low energies gm survey meters efficiency for such energies is about 10 smear surveys are usually required if meter is approved for c 14 measurements it may be used all waste in a p 33 work area is considered to be contaminated unless proven to be clean my appropriate monitoring techniques keep work areas free of unnecessary items segregate wastes to those with half lives from 19 days to less than 65 days limit of soluble waste to sewer is 100 microcuries day per lab 9 97
