basic contest page 1 eric roberts handout 45 cs106b february 22 2012 basic contest submission deadline monday march 12 paul allen rushed to the dorm to find bill gates they had to do a basic for this machine they had to if they didn t the revolution would start without them stephen manes and paul andrews gates 1994 in assignment 5 your goal is to build a minimal basic interpreter the simplest language system you could write that is nonetheless able to do some real computing for the basic contest your goal is to extend your assignment 5 submission to be the best basic interpreter you can build which is exactly the goal that paul allen and bill gates had in 1975 when they built a basic interpreter that would become the first product for a company called microsoft your job is to complete the requirements of the assignment and then add as many extensions as you can which can either be the ones listed here or any you can think of on your own the most impressive interpreter wins possible extensions the following extensions would make your basic interpreter much more exciting as a programming language in most implementations of basic the let keyword is optional incorporate this feature into your interpreter so that a statement like total n1 n2 is interpreted as an assignment statement make expressions work with floating point numbers instead of integers which is what real basic does this extension will require you to change the exp h interface so that the value stored in a constantexp is a double rather than an int change the parser to allow the minus sign to be used as a unary operator as well as a binary operator add simple library functions like sin cos and sqr square root extend the print statement so that it takes a list of expressions separated by commas if you include this extension you might also want to allow the list to contain quoted strings so that output messages can be displayed as in print the answer is total fortunately for you the scanner module already reads quoted strings which simplifies this extension a bit page 2 2 implement string variables so that you can work with alphabetic as well as numeric data in basic the names of string variables end with a so you can tell them apart from numeric ones strings are particularly useful if you also implement library functions to manipulate them try to implement other statement forms from basic such as the for next statement used for looping the gosub return statements used to simulate procedure calls or the dim statement used to introduce an array make it possible to list only a part of the program by allowing list to take a numeric range as in list 10 50 add the command old which loads an existing basic program from a file and save which writes out the current program add graphical capabilities that allow basic programs to draw lines in a graphics window you might want to look at books on basic for suggestions as to how you might go about designing the statements to provide this capability prizes as you are all now aware winning the grand prize in a contest entitles you to substitute a 100 for whatever individual score most negatively affects your grade at the end of the term thus if you win this contest and end up bombing an assignment the midterm or even the final we will overlook that misstep and count it as a 100 we will probably also award various runner up prizes and designate some entries as worthy of honorable mention all of which increases your chances for winning the random contest drawing at the review session for the final contest rules 1 only students registered in cs106b are eligible to submit entries 2 only one entry per person will be accepted 3 all entries must be submitted electronically by 5 00p m on monday march 12 using the procedure for submitting any other assignment late entries will not be accepted 4 each submission must consist of a basic interpreter written in c++ along with any basic program files that you want us to consider the help command in your interpreter must lists any extensions that the judges should take into account 5 contest entries will be evaluated initially by eric roberts and michael gummelt the best entries will then be evaluated by the entire course staff which will choose the winner and runners up
