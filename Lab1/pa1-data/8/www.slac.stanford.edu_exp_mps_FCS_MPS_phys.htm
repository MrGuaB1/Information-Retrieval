slac massive particle search physics search for stable massive elementary particles physics search for massive stable charged elementary particles goal search for electrically charged and stable elementary particles with masses larger than about 10 13 gev c 2 such particles would have to have been created during the early history of the universe particles would have to be sufficiently abundant so that there was of order one such particle in 0.01 to 0.1 grams of some selected material motivation accelerators either under construction or projected limit produced elementary particle masses and hence searches to below about 5 10 3 gev c 2 even with the requirement that the particle be stable it is worthwhile to search for particles with masses far beyond the reach of current or projected accelerators search method the search method is derived from our method of searching for particles with fractional electric charged using drops falling under gravity in air but no electric field is used the essential idea is that a 1 mm radius r drop containing material in suspensions with an overall specific gravity of say 1.5 has a mass m of 1 10 13 kg in elementary particle units this is about 10 13 gev c 2 the terminal velocity v is given by v m gm 6phr h viscosity of air g acceleration of gravity if the drop contains an elementary particle of mass m then the terminal velocity is larger v m+m g m+m 6phr therefore by measuring the terminal velocity v of each of a very large number of drops of uniform radius r we will search for drops with an anomalously large terminal velocity v m+m remarks it is necessary to measure the drop radius well hence two methods are used r i is derived directly from the image of the drop and r d is derived from the fraunhofer diffraction pattern of the drop the search range is about 10 13 to 10 17 gev c 2 the lower limit being set by problems in working with very small drops the upper limit being set by the requirement that the charge of the sought particle must keep the particle anchored to ordinary matter by electrostatic force reference ml perl new method for searching for massive stable charged elementary particles physical review d v 57 7 pp 4441 4445 apr 1 1998 j glanz superheavy particles from the big bang science 283 1095 1999 slac home mps home hist phys fcmat apparat testmat microdrop results team refs mpsphys mspappat mpsrefs january 8 2001 stanford linear accelerator center website maintenance erlee slac stanford edu
