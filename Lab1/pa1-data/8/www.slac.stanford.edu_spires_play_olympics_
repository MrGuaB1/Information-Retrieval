topcite olympics spires image hep hepnames institutions conferences experiments jobs videos topcite olympics how many topcited papers are there from various countries asked by heath o connell answered by heath o connell and travis brooks athens edition 2004 sydney edition 2000 these tables rank individual countries by the number of topcite papers in the spires hep database this is done by looking at where the paper was written rather than the nationality of the author thus if a brazilian physicist say writes a topcited paper at cern it will be counted as a swiss topcite if she then moves to waterloo u her next paper will count as a canadian topcite in addition to this one paper can count towards the topcite tally of several countries note another point to note is that the country is determined by the location of the institution at present thus for example the soviet union is not represented even though many of the russian topcites date from the ussr era in addtion to the above the usual disclaimer about citations applies the list is intended for entertainment purposes only and topcited authors should be modest in their dreams for commercial endorsements you might also be interested in comparing it with the real olympics note that we appear to consider physics a summer rather than winter event we leave the reader to speculate on the reasoning behind this choice the national statistics were taken from the cia world factbook and might provide interesting context for the numbers mistakes are probably ours not theirs footnote in the 2000 edition to ensure that a substantial contribution was made by each nation on the paper the list generally excluded the large multi national collaborations the cost of this was a certain bias towards theoretical papers in the 2004 edition in the olympic tradition we changed the rules now we are allowing the experimentalists to compete as well as the theorists perhaps this is similar to allowing the professional atheletes in the games or perhaps not the only papers excluded from the counts are those by the particle data group whose mastery of citation events is well established playground playground home email us spires topcites recent topcites hep reviews symmetry breaking playground biblio tools spires tools preprint listing resources arxiv hepdata pdg slac books about spires slac slac library contact spires hep is a joint project of slac desy & fnal as well as the worldwide hep community mirrors desy germany fermilab us ihep russia durham u uk slac us yitp japan lipi indonesia last updated 08 05 2004 valid xhtml 1.0 valid css
