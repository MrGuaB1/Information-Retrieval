miniclean 360 a liquid argon neon dark matter detector page 1 miniclean 360 a liquid argon neon dark matter detector keith rielage los alamos national laboratory for the deap clean collaboration miniclean 360 utilizes 360 kg of liquid argon to detect the nuclear recoil from wimp dark matter with a projected cross section sensitivity of 10 45 cm2 to reach this planned sensitivity a unique modular design is being developed with a spherical geometry to maximize light collection using pmts pulse shape discrimination techniques separate nuclear recoil signal from the electron recoil backgrounds resulting from the beta decay of 39ar and compton scattering of gamma rays the design allows for the replacement of the target material with liquid neon to examine any signal and backgrounds with a different sensitivity it also provides research and development for a larger scale low energy solar neutrino experiment using neon clean cryogenic low energy astrophysics with noble gases that plans to measure the pp solar neutrino flux to 1 particular attention is being paid to mitigating the background from contamination of surfaces by radon daughters during assembly the engineering design radon mitigation plan and various testing setups are presented miniclean 360 anticipates the start of data collection in mid 2009 at snolab in sudbury ontario canada 1
