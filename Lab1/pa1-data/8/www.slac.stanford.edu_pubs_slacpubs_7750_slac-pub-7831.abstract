we report new preliminary b physics results obtained with 300000 hadronic i z sup 0 sup i decays collected by the sld experiment at the slc between 1993 and 1997 three analyses are presented a measurement of i b sup sup i and i b sup 0 sup sub d sub i lifetimes a study of the time dependence of i b sup 0 sup sub s sub i i anti b sup 0 sup sub s sub i mixing and a search for decays of the type i b i i sg i all analyses benefit from the small and stable interaction point and the excellent resolution and efficiency provided by the pixel based ccd vertex detector the i b i i sg i analysis also exploits the particle identification capabilities of the cherenkov ring imaging detector
