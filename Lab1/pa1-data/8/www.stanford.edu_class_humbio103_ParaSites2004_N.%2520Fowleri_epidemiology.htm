untitled document epidemiology how common is n fowleri infection with n fowleri is relatively rare since n fowleri was first described in 1965 about 300 cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis have been reported it is most often seen in healthy active young people this may be because this population is most likely to be exposed to the organism through swimming or diving in infected water interestingly although infection is rare n fowleri is very common a survey of lakes in florida showed that 46 have n fowleri in addition antibodies to n fowleri is widespread in the population indicating that exposure is common where is n fowleri found courtesy of getty images n fowleri is found in warm moist environments like soil and fresh water although soil is the preferred environment heavy rains and runoffs often introduce the organism to bodies of water where most humans are exposed n fowleri is most likely seen in warm stagnant water like lakes ponds and thermally polluted streams under these conditions the bacteria the organism feeds on is more abundant the risk of n fowleri increases as water temperature rises and the organism is most likely to invade bodies of water during hot dry weather in the summer it can grow in waters as warm as 45 degrees celcius n fowleri has been found in a wide variety of water sources including coastal water freshwater sewage poorly chlorinated swimming pools artificial lakes hot tubs and hot springs in one case of pam the organism was even traced back to the household water supply courtesy of getty images worldwide distribution n fowleri is distributed worldwide cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis pam have been reported on all continents except antartica the majority of cases have been seen in developed countries 75 of cases have been from the united states australia and czechkoslovia but this is probably due to better reporting and greater awareness of disease
