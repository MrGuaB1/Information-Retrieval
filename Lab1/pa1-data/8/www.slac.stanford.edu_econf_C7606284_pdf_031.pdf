l li++ li page 1 modest detector for zo search in the existing tunnel d cline department of physics university of wisconsin madison wisconsin 53706 i propose that an early search for the intermediate boson con centrate on p p zo x l li++ li and an accompanying modest detector that fits in the existing tunnel since the pp collision is likely to give zo with x 0 the most common production will be thus a search for back to back 1i pairs with pli 10 gev c will be necessary the symmetry of this process can be used to simplify the detector i propose that both ll's be detected but the momentum of only one need be measured at least initially a simple detector capable of being installed in the present tunnel is shown in fig 1 the iron magnet would be 5 ft thick and s p 15 could be obtained using a drift chamber system 1i pli the solid angle of this detector can be n depending on how close the iron magnet is placed page 2 514 proof that we have indeed observed the zo and not the con tinuum or another like state would be obtained from 1 a peak in the p spectrum at mzo 2 2 a large asymmetry only one need be measured to observed this i estimate a rate of few detected events day if the pp 28 2 1 luminosity reaches 10 cm sec and expect that much of this detector can be pieced together and the cost is less than look page 3 p fjt f i yf fj i vf o lo bp c f 0 cfd q o f ri b surface o p c d o6 00 lp o ol o o i o o o j a 0 0 to p6 &o ij o di rt s or djc c 09 t 6 bo jo og o ii i i 0 0 c 6p 0 0 jof o d c o fo 9r c dti fm 6 i _ oodocrqy 9socdnft ch oyo o o oo c uyo 11 0 o r cgo co o f7 w oo amber o y 0 bo 0 r c o j dq 0 0 l c o v o j i n p o 0 0 o o b ovo r 0 0 oo oo oo s p 4 i ewer q ya oqb e f ogoo pipe 6 c q ob o fj_0t 0 o j tunnel with zo detector i lj1 lj1 dirt i liquid scintillation counters i f 11 _ edis fl ring pack with lead fig 1 page 4
