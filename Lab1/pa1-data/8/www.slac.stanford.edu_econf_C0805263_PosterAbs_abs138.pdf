the possibility of detecting neutrinos by coherent scattering on high debye temperature monocrystals such as sapphire is present page 1 the possibility of detecting neutrinos by coherent scattering on high debye temperature monocrystals such as sapphire is presented and discussed preliminary estimations showed that 1 mev neutrinos with a fluency density of 10 12 cm 2 s 1 could interact with a force of about 10 6 dyne with a 100 g sapphire monocrystal a torsion balance provided with 1 m length molybdenum wire and an optical autocollimator able to measure small rotation angles of about 0.1 seconds of arc could give positive results the design of a high sensitivity torsion balance under construction provided with such a detector is presented and discussed
