slac ap 113 vertical emittance studies at the atf damping ring slac slac pubs and reports slac ap 113 vertical emittance studies at the atf damping ring abstract a primary purpose of the atf damping ring is to demonstrate the small vertical emittance required for a future linear collider in this report we first describe the diagnostics available to measure this emittance then we discuss the dependence of the emittance on various parameters such as the betatron tunes vacuum pressure and beam current and subsequently study several methods of betatron coupling correction next we show that the interferometer used to determine the vertical beam size is sensitive to transverse beam tails and does not measure the core emittance which could explain the observed sensitivity of the measured spot size to vacuum pressure and beam intensity finally we summarize the results and propose a few further studies in the appendix we present recent measurements of the dynamic aperture and discuss the variation of the beta functions eg at the synchrotron light monitor with the betatron tune here we also present details of the sussix program by which in the future we hope to infer all linear coupling parameters as well as higher order nonlinearities from turn by turn orbit data full text pdf slac ap 113 1.40 mb compressed postscript slac ap 113 572 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 05 apr 2001 11 07 pdt by htmlme pl
