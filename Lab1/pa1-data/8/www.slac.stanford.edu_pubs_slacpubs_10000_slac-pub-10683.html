slac pub 10683 linac alignment and frequency tolerances from the perspective of contained emittances for the g nlc slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 10683 linac alignment and frequency tolerances from the perspective of contained emittances for the g nlc abstract the next generation of linear colliders will consist of several tens of thousands of accelerating structures and this will entail inevitable errors in the dimensions and alignments of cells and groups thereof these errors result in a dilution of the beam emittance and consequently a loss in overall luminosity of the collider for this reason it is important to understand the alignment tolerances and frequency tolerances that are imposed for a specified emittance budget here we specify an emittance dilution of no more than 10 of the injected nominal value of 20 nm rads and we track the progress of the beam down the linac whilst accelerating structures and sub sections thereof are misaligned in a random manner random frequencies are also incorporated in the misalignment analyses tolerances are specified for both frequency errors and misalignment errors full text pdf slac pub 10683 112 kb compressed postscript not available for this document more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 03 sep 2004 08 08 pdt by htmlme pl
