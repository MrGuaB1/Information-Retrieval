slac pub 10143 new old inflation slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 10143 new old inflation abstract we propose a new class of inflationary solutions to the standard cosmological problems horizon flatness monopole based on a modification of old inflation these models do not require a potential which satisfies the normal inflationary slow roll conditions our universe arises from a single tunneling event as the inflaton leaves the false vacuum subsequent dynamics arising from either the oscillations of the inflaton field or thermal effects keep a second field trapped in a false minimum resulting in an evanescent period of inflation with roughly 50 e foldings inside the bubble this easily allows the bubble to grow sufficiently large to contain our present horizon volume reheating is accomplished when the inflaton driving the last stage of inflation rolls down to the true vacuum and adiabatic density perturbations arise from moduli dependent yukawa couplings of the inflaton to matter fields our scenario has several robust predictions including virtual absence of gravity waves a possible absence of tilt in scalar perturbations and a higher degree of non gaussianity than other models it also naturally incorporates a solution to the cosmological moduli problem full text pdf slac pub 10143 252 kb compressed postscript slac pub 10143 241 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 07 oct 2003 09 32 pdt by htmlme pl
