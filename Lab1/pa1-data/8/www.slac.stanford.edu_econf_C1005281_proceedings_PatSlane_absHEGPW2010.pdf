pulsar wind nebulae a multiwavelength perspective page 1 pulsar wind nebulae a multiwavelength perspective pat slane harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics cambridge ma 02138 usa abstract the extended nebulae formed as pulsar winds expand into their surroundings provide information about the composition of the winds the injection history from the host pulsar and the material into which the nebulae are expanding observations from across the electromagnetic spectrum provide constraints on the evolution of the nebulae the density and composition of the surrounding ejecta the geometry of the central engines and the long term fate of the energetic particles produced in these systems such observations reveal the presence of jets and wind termination shocks time varying compact emission structures shocked supernova ejecta and newly formed dust here i provide a broad overview of the structure of pulsar wind nebulae with specific examples from observations extending from the radio band to very high energy gamma rays that demonstrate our ability to constrain the history and ultimate fate of the energy released in the spin down of young pulsars 1
