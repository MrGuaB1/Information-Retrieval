numerical linear algebra newcommand ones mathbf 1 about how long does a 1 gflop computer take to solve a system of 100 linear equations with 100 variables one hundred microseconds incorrect one millisecond correct ten milliseconds incorrect one hundred milliseconds incorrect one second incorrect about how long does a 1 gflop computer take to solve 10 systems of 100 linear equations with the same coefficient matrix but 5 different righthand sides one hundred microseconds incorrect one millisecond correct ten milliseconds incorrect one hundred milliseconds incorrect one second incorrect algorithm flop counts allow for very accurate prediction of running time on a given computer true incorrect false correct since matrix multiplication is associative the flop count for multiplying three or more matrices doesn t depend on the order in which you multiply them true incorrect false correct suppose a in mathbf r n times n is lower triangular the flop count for computing ab is the same order as the flop count for computing a 1 b true correct false incorrect suppose a in mathbf r m times n and we need to compute x that minimizes ax b 2_2 rho 2 x _2 2 where rho 0 for m geq n the flop count order is m 3 incorrect m 2n incorrect mn 2 correct n 3 incorrect for m leq n the flop count order is m 3 incorrect m 2n correct mn 2 incorrect n 3 incorrect suppose m geq n we have already solved the problem for one value of rho and now we want to compute the solution for k other values of rho this gives the so called regularization path the flop count order for doing this is mnk correct m 2nk incorrect mn 2k incorrect mnk 2 incorrect last updated at 2012 02 21 09 03 17 pst
