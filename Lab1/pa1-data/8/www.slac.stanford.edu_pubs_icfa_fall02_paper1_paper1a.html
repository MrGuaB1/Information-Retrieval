iib fall 2002 paper no 1 priscilla b cushman and adriaan h heering cms hcal hybrid photodiode design and quality assurance stations full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract the hadronic calorimeter for the cms experiment requires photodetection in a 4 tesla magnetic field this plus high neutron radiation and a 25 ns bunch crossing necessitated the development of a new type of high rate multi channel hybrid photodiode as our specifications became tighter design changes in the diode structure and surface treatment became necessary resulting in a better product with very low crosstalk in both ac and dc modes the specifications are rigorous and are maintained by a set of automated quality assurance stations which will process 570 tubes over 2 years full article last modified 17 june 2002 j schwiening
