section handout 7 graphs page 1 eric roberts handout 52 cs106b march 5 2012 section handout 7 graphs the purpose of this section is to let you work with graph algorithms before you start the pathfinder assignment in earnest each of the questions use the definitions of the graph class and the node and arc structures as they appear in the pathfinder assignment 1 coding depth first search write a function bool pathexists node n1 node n2 that returns true if there is a path in the graph between the nodes n1 and n2 in this version of the exercise implement this function by using depth first search to traverse the graph from n1 if you encounter n2 along the way then a path exists 2 coding breadth first search rewrite the pathexists function with so that the algorithm uses a breadth first search instead 3 understanding graph algorithms those of you who have played clue or cluedo if you come from outside north america will recognize the following undirected graph which shows the connections between the various rooms on the game board the numbers on the various arcs show the distance measured in spaces on the board between pairs of rooms for example the distance from the hall to the lounge is 8 steps and the distance from the ball room to the billiard room is 6 steps in this problem the secret passages that connect the rooms at the corners of the board the kitchen study and lounge conservatory arcs are arbitrarily assumed to have distance 3 kitchen ball room conservatory lounge hall study billiard room library dining room 7 4 8 4 4 11 7 4 7 3 3 6 7 8 7 page 2 2 3a indicate the order of traversal for a depth first search starting at the lounge assume that iteration over a set chooses nodes in alphabetical order as it does in the graph class thus the first step in the depth first search will be to the conservatory rather than to the dining room or hall both of which come later in the alphabet 3b indicate the order of traversal for a breadth first search starting at the kitchen as before assume that nodes in any set are processed in alphabetical order 3c trace the operation of dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum path from the lounge to the library 3d trace the operation of kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree for the clue board
