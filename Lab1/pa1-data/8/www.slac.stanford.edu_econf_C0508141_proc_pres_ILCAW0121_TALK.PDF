earth's curvature himel 3 page 1 the safest way the straight and narrow no confusion no surprise earth's curvature himel 3 pt wg1 21 aug 2005 note the judgments in this presentation are solely those of the author and do not represent a consensus of wg1 page 2 the options there are 3 laser straight piecewise straight with discrete vertical arcs continually curved to some extent the selected site will dictate which of these options are really viable want to determine degree to which all options are open prior to site selection page 3 pros cons minimum risk laser straight most heavily studied eliminates all vertical dispersion from linac best for emittance preservation minimum cost continually curved laser straight leads to deep excavations piecewise straight requires extra length technical cryogenic favors bds would prefer for both sides of bds to lie in 1 plane would like expansion room back into linac in bds plane also page 4 preliminary recommendation linac can have any of 3 geometries limit only studied curvatures up to earth's radius 6370 km cannot vouch for sharper curvature would need study prior to site selection bds must be in a plane last 0.5 km of linac on each side must be in plane with bds bunch compressor not yet studied page 5 r & d more thorough studies of operations and tuning in piecewise straight and curved linac complete by end 1st q cy 2006 extend study to bc can it be curved complete by end 1st q cy 2006 specific site studies can the desired curvature for a given site be accommodated on request of gde once sites are picked
