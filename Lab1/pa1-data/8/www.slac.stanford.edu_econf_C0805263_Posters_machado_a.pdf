introduction usually in the context of the standard model and the multi higgs extentions the fermion mass matrices has the form page 1 introduction usually in the context of the standard model and the multi higgs extentions the fermion mass matrices has the form where the denotes an arbitrary complex dimensioonless 3x3 matrices and the denotes the set of the vacuum expetation values vev of one or more neutral scalar field the mixing matrix and the mass pattern of each charged sector depend on the structure of the respectives here we will turn the problem upside dwon mass matrices will be of the form where h_i denotes some dimensionless o 1 parameters and is a matrix built with the vevs of several scalar fields at first sight there is no gain in predictive power we are just changing a dimensionless general matrix by another one with mass dimension however it seems easier at least in proiniple to explain patterns of dynamics and extra flavor symmetries that we can impose to the model therefore we propose a multi higgs extention of the standard model with the followung symmetry in conclusion the mass matrices obtained arise because of the symmetries of the model give appropiate insight concerning the solution of the flavor problem of course it is necessary to explain how these symmetries are realized from a more fundamental theory from the bound equations for the quarks like u considering all the vev's real and the condition of the a4 symmetry we have
