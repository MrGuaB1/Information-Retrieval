slac pub 10175 effect of rf parameters on breakdown limits in high vacuum x band structures slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 10175 effect of rf parameters on breakdown limits in high vacuum x band structures abstract rf breakdown is one of the major factors determining performance of high power rf components and rf sources rf breakdown limits working power and produces irreversible surface damage the breakdown limit depends on the rf circuit structure geometry and rf frequency it is also a function of the input power pulse width and surface electric and magnetic fields in this paper we discuss multi megawatt operation of x band rf structures at pulse width on the order of one microsecond these structures are used in rf systems of high gradient accelerators recent experiments at stanford linear accelerator center slac have explored the functional dependence of breakdown limit on input power and pulse width the experimental data covered accelerating structures and waveguides another breakdown limit of accelerating structures was associated with high magnetic fields found in waveguide to structure couplers to understand and quantify these limits we simulated 3d structures with the electrodynamics code ansoft hfss and the particle in cell code magic3d results of these simulations together with experimental data will be discussed in this paper full text pdf slac pub 10175 3.01 mb compressed postscript slac pub 10175 5.43 mb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 30 sep 2003 14 37 pdt by htmlme pl
