slac pub 8461 mirror symmetry for open strings slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8461 mirror symmetry for open strings abstract we discuss the generation of superpotentials in d 4 n 1 supersymmetric field theories arising from type iia d6 branes wrapped on supersymmetric three cycles of a calabi yau threefold in general nontrivial superpotentials arise from sums over disc instantons we then find several examples of special lagrangian three cycles with nontrivial topology which are mirror to obstructed rational curves conclusively demonstrating the existence of such instanton effects in addition we present explicit examples of disc instantons ending on the relevant three cycles finally we give a preliminary construction of a mirror map for the open string moduli in a large radius limit of the type iia compactification full text pdf slac pub 8461 595 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8461 3.88 mb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
