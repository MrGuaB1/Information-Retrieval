randomized numerical linear algebra page 1 ee378b statistical signal processing randomized numerical linear algebra andrea montanari lecture 12 13 due on 5 17 2011 this is the last homework it is a cartoon application of approximate linear algebra methods for m n n define the sets am bn r2 by letting am ak 1 cos 2k m sin 2k m k 1 m bn bk 3 cos 2k n 3 sin 2k n k 1 n in other words am is an m points discretization of the unit circle centered at 1 0 and bn ia an n points discretization of the circle or radius 3 centered at 0 0 define the matrix a rm n by letting for i m j n aij log ai bj 2 1 this matrix has an interesting physics interpretation if electric charges q1 qn are placed respectively at positions b1 bn the two dimensional electrostatic potential produced at positions a1 am is up to a normalization constant aq 1 aq m 1 compute the first three left singular vectors of a ie those corresponding to the three largest singular values by using an exact deterministic method eg orthogonal iteration plot these eigenvectors ie for each of the three eigenvectors x l rm plot x l m versus m the choice of m and n is left to you ideally we would like m n corresponding to a continuous charge distribution you are encouraged to use m n as large as you can 2 implement the randomized linear algebra method described in class as algorithm 1 cf p drineas et al clustering large graphs via the singular value decomposition use it to compute the first three left singular vectors of the matrix a described above using a number of columns c 10 20 30 increase c until you are satisfied with the results plot the singular vectors
