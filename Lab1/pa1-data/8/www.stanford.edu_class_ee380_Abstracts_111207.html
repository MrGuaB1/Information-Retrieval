abstract bio stanford ee computer systems colloquium 4 15pm wednesday dec 7 2011 skilling auditorium stanford campus http ee380 stanford edu pushing the limits of computational imaging shree k nayar tc chang professor of computer science columbia university about the talk computational imaging uses unconventional optics to capture a coded image and an appropriate algorithm to decode the captured image this approach of manipulating images before there are recorded and processing recorded images before they are presented has three key benefits first it enables us to implement imaging functionalities that would be difficult if not impossible to achieve using traditional imaging second it can be used to significantly reduce the hardware complexity of an imaging system lastly under appropriate imaging conditions it allows us to break the limits of traditional imaging in this talk i ll show recent examples of imaging systems that demonstrate these benefits i ll conclude with a brief discussion on the fundamental limits of computational imaging slides there is no downloadable version of the slides for this talk available at this time about the speaker shree k nayar received his phd degree in electrical and computer engineering from the robotics institute at carnegie mellon university in 1990 he is currently the tc chang professor of computer science at columbia university he co directs the columbia vision and graphics center he also heads the columbia computer vision laboratory cave which is dedicated to the development of advanced computer vision systems his research is focused on three areas the creation of novel cameras the design of physics based models for vision and the development of algorithms for scene understanding his work is motivated by applications in the fields of digital imaging computer graphics and robotics he has received best paper awards at iccv 1990 icpr 1994 cvpr 1994 iccv 1995 cvpr 2000 cvpr 2004 and iccp 2010 he is the recipient of the david marr prize 1990 and 1995 the david and lucile packard fellowship 1992 the national young investigator award 1993 the ntt distinguished scientific achievement award 1994 the keck foundation award for excellence in teaching 1995 the columbia great teacher award in 2006 and the carnegie mellon alumni achievement award in 2009 he was elected to the national academy of engineering in 2008 and to the american academy of arts and sciences in 2011 contact information shree nayar tc chang professor of computer science columbia university new york city new york
