towards a simple congestion control protocol for fast long distance networks page 1 towards a simple congestion control protocol for fast long distance networks min wook jeong abdul kader kabbani in this project we aim to streamline a reliable transport protocol that can achieve i high bandwidth utilization ii fast bandwidth recovery iii low loss rate and iv acceptable fairness properties in high bandwidth delay product networks our objective is to build such a protocol with minimal changes to the internet infrastructure ie without introducing any changes to the intermediate routers or the tcp packet headers we are mainly motivated by the mechanisms which are behind the success of qcn and bic tcp on one hand qcn is an ethernet rate based congestion control scheme has no notion of reliability that can achieve the above four objectives successfully but relies on multi bit feedback messages sent from compatible switches on the other hand it is not very clear to us whether bic tcp or cubic can meet all of the requirements above once it is extensively evaluated upon further evaluating bic tcp we can better decide on how our protocol should be designed and what new mechanisms analogous to qcn's rate based ones or else might be needed to achieve our objectives
