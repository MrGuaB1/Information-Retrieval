vres polyadd v1 v2 performs polynomial addition and returns the result all polynomials are expressed as vectors with the following format the first element describes the lowest order of the terms in the polynomial while the rest of the elements give the coefficients of the terms starting with the lowest order term eg v 3 2 4 1 corresponds to 2 x 3 4 x 4 x 5 george ginis may 2001 function vres polyadd v1 v2 polynomial length must be equal for both v1 and v2 len length v1 if length v1 length v2 disp vectors in polyadd have unequal length exit end d1 v1 1 lowest order of polynomial 1 d2 v2 1 lowest order of polynomial 2 p1 v1 2 len coefficients of polynomial 1 p2 v2 2 len coefficients of polynomial 2 if d1 d2 polynomials have the same degree vres 1 d1 vres 2 len p1 p2 elseif d1 d2 first polynomial has higher degree diff d1 d2 p1new zeros 1 len 1 p1new 1 diff len 1 p1 1 len diff 1 perform shift of p2 vres 1 d2 vres 2 len p1new p2 else d1 d2 second polynomial has higher degree diff d2 d1 p2new zeros 1 len 1 p2new 1 diff len 1 p2 1 len diff 1 perform shift of p1 vres 1 d1 vres 2 len p1 p2new end
