powerpoint presentation embedded bluetooth gang xie presents to ee281 class stanford university 11 22 2002 bluetooth was originally a cable replacement technology you arrive at the office in the office while in a meeting when inspecting equipment on the road you arrive at the airport you enter the airport waiting lounge you get on the rent a car bus documentation specification describes how the technology works ie the bluetooth protocol architecture profiles describe how the technology is used ie how different parts of the specification can be used to fulfill a desired function for a bluetooth device bluetooth specification protocol stack bluetooth profile structure radio specification 0 1 2 78 2.402 ghz 2.480 ghz pdu format the bluetooth system is operating in the 2.4 ghz ism industrial scientific medicine band the regulatory range of this frequency band is 2.400 2.4835 ghz the bluetooth radio accomplishes spectrum spreading by in 79 hops displaced by 1 mhz radio modulation uses gfsk operating frequency bands baseband specification there is one master and one or more slaves in each piconet packet format service discovery protocol specification protocol data unit format pdu id identifies the type of pdu transaction id uniquely identifies request pdus and is used to match response pdus to request pdus parameter length bluetooth design and development tools design tools rf and digital design tools simulators and other tools development tools including modules chipsets ra and digital kits protocol implementations and other tools testing evaluation tools key features robustness low complexity low power battery powered low cost about $5 fast acknowledgement fast frequency hopping scheme shorter packets http www bluetooth com http www palowireless com http e www motorola com http www brainboxes com http www google com references
