random h random h this interface exports functions for generating pseudorandom numbers functions randominteger low high returns a random integer in the range low to high inclusive randomreal low high returns a random real number in the half open interval low high randomchance p returns true with the probability indicated by p setrandomseed seed sets the internal random number seed to the specified value function detail int randominteger int low int high returns a random integer in the range low to high inclusive usage int n randominteger low high double randomreal double low double high returns a random real number in the half open interval low high a half open interval includes the first endpoint but not the second which means that the result is always greater than or equal to low but strictly less than high usage double d randomreal low high bool randomchance double p returns true with the probability indicated by p the argument p must be a floating point number between 0 never and 1 always for example calling randomchance 30 returns true 30 percent of the time usage if randomchance p void setrandomseed int seed sets the internal random number seed to the specified value you can use this function to set a specific starting point for the pseudorandom sequence or to ensure that program behavior is repeatable during the debugging phase usage setrandomseed seed
