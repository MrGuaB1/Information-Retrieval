tips on centrifugation without a balance tube tips on centrifugation without a balance tube safe centrifugation requires balanced loading of the centrifuge rotor imbalanced rotors can lead to damage to centrifuge rotors when an odd number of tubes are loaded a balance tube is loaded opposite the last sample tube the balance tube must be identical to the sample tubes and must contain liquid of equal density to the sample balancing by mass alone is not correct since the centrifugal force that the sample applies to the rotor is dependent on both mass and radius see figure 1 for balance loading patterns based on a 12 position microcentrifuge rotor table 1 algorithms for balanced microcentrifuge rotor loading requirements the rotor has n positions such that n is divisible by 6 or if less than 6 an even number of positions the number of samples is between 2 and n but not equal to n 1 tubes and sample volumes are identical algorithm a sample number is even load pairs of tubes in opposite positions algorithm b sample number is odd load three tubes at equal intervals in the rotor forming an equilateral triangle load the remaining tube in pairs in opposite positions credits frothingham r 1999 february centrifugation without a balance tube american biotechnology laboratory 17 84 dr richard frothingham is a staff physician in the infectious disease section durham va medical center he is also an assistant professor of medicine at duke university medical center durham nc
