linear quadratic lyapunov theory page 1 ee363 prof s boyd linear quadratic lyapunov theory lyapunov equations we assume a rn n p pt rn n it follows that q qt rn n continuous time linear system for x ax v z zt pz we have v z zt qz where p q satisfy continuous time lyapunov equation at p pa q 0 discrete time linear system for x t 1 ax t v z zt pz we have v z zt qz where p q satisfy discrete time lyapunov equation at pa p q 0 lyapunov theorems if p 0 q 0 then system is globally asymptotically stable if p 0 q 0 and q a observable then system is globally asymptotically stable if p 0 q 0 then all trajectories of the system are bounded if q 0 then the sublevel sets z zt pz a are invariant these are ellipsoids if p 0 if p 0 and q 0 then a is not stable converse theorems if a is stable there exists a quadratic lyapunov function v z zt pz that proves it ie there exists p 0 q 0 that satisfies the continuous or discrete time lyapunov equation if a is stable and q 0 then p 0 if a is stable q 0 and q a observable then p 0 lyapunov equation solvability conditions the discrete time lyapunov equation has a unique solution p for any q qt if and only if i a j a 1 for i j 1 n if a is stable lyapunov equation has a unique solution p for any q qt 1 page 2 integral sum solution of lyapunov equation if x ax is globally asymptotically stable and q qt p 0 eat tqeat dt is the unique solution of the lyapunov equation at p pa q 0 if x t 1 ax t is globally asymptotically stable and q qt p t 0 at tqat is the unique solution of the lyapunov equation at pa p q 0 2
