next linear collider test accelerator page 1 next linear collider test accelerator tour of nlcta next linear collider test accelerator nlcta is a self contained accelerator facility located on the slac site that uses state of the art photoinjector and x band technology in combination with solid state lasers to produce electron beams up to 120 mev in energy students working at nlcta have a unique opportunity to engage in hands on operation of a fully functioning accelerator and to propose and carry out experiments using relativistic electron beams and infrared lasers current experiments include direct acceleration of electrons using lasers and dielectric microstructures use of lasers and magnets to produce higher harmonic temporal bunching development and testing of novel high power microwave structures production of terahertz radiation using electron beams development of high frequency x band microwave accelerator structures tour time thur sept 22 3 4 pm rendezvous at building 41 courtyard at 2 45pm sign up at lunch & poster session 12pm panofsky breezeway or by contacting joel england england slac stanford edu class 10000 laser room nlcta control room nlcta beamline
