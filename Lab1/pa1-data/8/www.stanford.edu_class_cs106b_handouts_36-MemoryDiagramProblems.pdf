memory diagram problem set page 1 eric roberts handout 36 cs106b february 10 2012 memory diagram problem set this problem set appears in lieu of this week's section which we canceled to give you more time to prepare for the exam solve each of these problems on paper and bring them to your section next week for each of these problems you should use the techniques described in chapter 12 to create heap stack diagrams at the indicated point in the execution you need not include explicit addresses in your diagram but must indicate either through addresses or arrows where reference values point in memory for extra practice you might try drawing the heap stack diagrams in both the explicit address and arrow forms problem 1 enum suit clubs diamonds hearts spades struct card int rank suit suit card makecard int rank suit suit int main card hand new card 2 hand 0 makecard 9 diamonds hand 1 makecard 7 hearts return 0 card makecard int rank suit suit card card card rank rank card suit suit return card diagram at this point on the second call to this function heap stack page 2 2 problem 2 class student public student id 0 gpa 4.0 student int id double gpa this id id this gpa gpa diagram at this point on the second call to the constructor private int id double gpa int main student advisees new student 2 advisees 0 student 2718281 3.61 advisees 1 student 3141592 4.2 return 0 heap stack page 3 3 problem 3 struct intvector int array int capacity int count void expandcapacity intvector & vec int main intvector vec vec capacity 2 vec count 2 vec array new int 2 vec array 0 17 vec array 1 42 expandcapacity vec return 0 void expandcapacity intvector & vec int oldarray vec array vec capacity 2 vec array new int vec capacity for int i 0 i vec count i++ vec array i oldarray i free oldarray diagram at this point just before the call to free heap stack
