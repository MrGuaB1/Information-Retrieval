class gpolygon the stanford c++ libraries include gtypes h class gpolygon this class represents a polygon and consists of a vector of the vertices constructor gpolygon creates a gpolygon object with no internal vertices methods addvertex pt addvertex x y adds a new vertex to the polygon addedge dx dy adds a new vertex to the polygon whose coordinates are displaced by dx and dy from the last vertex addpolaredge r theta adds a new vertex to the polygon whose coordinates are r pixels away from the last point in the direction specified by theta contains pt contains x y returns true if the polygon contains the given point which may be specified either as a point or as distinct coordinates tostring converts the gpolygon to a string constructor detail gpolygon creates a gpolygon object with no internal vertices the vertices must be added using vector operations or the methods addvertex addedge or addpolaredge usage gpolygon poly method detail void addvertex gpoint pt void addvertex double x double y adds a new vertex to the polygon usage poly addvertex pt poly addvertex x y void addedge double dx double dy adds a new vertex to the polygon whose coordinates are displaced by dx and dy from the last vertex usage poly addedge dx dy void addpolaredge double r double theta adds a new vertex to the polygon whose coordinates are r pixels away from the last point in the direction specified by theta usage poly addpolaredge r theta bool contains gpoint pt bool contains double x double y returns true if the polygon contains the given point which may be specified either as a point or as distinct coordinates usage if poly contains pt if poly contains x y string tostring converts the gpolygon to a string usage string str poly tostring
