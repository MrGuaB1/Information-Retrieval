iib spring 2004 paper no 2 m titov radiation damage and long term aging in gas detectors full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract aging phenomena constitute one of the most complex and serious potential problems which could limit or severely impair the use of gaseous detectors in unprecedented harsh radiation environments long term operation in high intensity experiments of the lhc era not only demands extraordinary radiation hardness of construction materials and gas mixtures but also very specific and appropriate assembly procedures and quality checks during detector construction and testing recent experimental data from hadron beams is discussed it is shown that the initial stage of radiation tests usually performed under isolated laboratory conditions may not offer the full information needed to extrapolate to the long term performance of real and full size detectors at high energy physics facilities major factors closely related to the capability of operating at large localized ionization densities and which could lead to operation instabilities and subsequent aging phenomena in gaseous detectors are summarized finally an overview of aging experience with state of the art gas detectors in experiments with low and high intensity radiation environments is given with a goal of providing a set of rules along with some caveat for the construction and operation of gaseous detectors in high luminosity experiments full article last modified 20 april 2004 j schwiening
