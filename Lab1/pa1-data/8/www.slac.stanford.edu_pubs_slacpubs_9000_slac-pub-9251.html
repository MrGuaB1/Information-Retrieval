slac pub 9251 status of the lcls x ray fel program slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 9251 status of the lcls x ray fel program abstract the linac coherent light source lcls program involves a collaboration of several us national laboratories and universities with the goal of designing and building the first 4th generation hard x ray source an x ray free electron laser fel this fel will utilize extremely short intense low emittance electron pulses created by the high energy linear accelerator at the stanford linear accelerator center the fel radiation produced will feature unprecedented peak brightness short pulse length and spatial coherence tunable over an energy range of 0.8 8 kev with favorable funding major construction will begin by 2004 and the lcls will be operating late in 2006 the lcls facility will include experimental stations for carrying out groundbreaking experiments in several scientific fields current r &d efforts are directed at experimentally studying the physics of high gain fels and refining the details of the plan for the lcls facility the fel experiments at argonne and brookhaven national labs along with experiments carried out at the german laboratory desy have confirmed the basic physical concepts upon which lcls is based and have demonstrated that many of the stringent technical requirements can already be met full text pdf slac pub 9251 138 kb compressed postscript slac pub 9251 297 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf file can be best viewed using adobe reader 4.0 or greater more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 09 aug 2002 14 12 pdt by htmlme pl
