avr tetris andy chao nate hill department of electrical engineering stanford university introduction the game tetris is a popular computer game that was developed by alexey pajitnov dmitry pavlovsky and vadim gerasimov in 1985 86 the rule of the game is quite simple and as follows blocks of bricks each fail down in a play field and a player can rotate and move the block sideways when the block hits the ground or another block below this piece stays at that position if any line of bricks is full then the line is removed from the play field as a result the player gains points furthermore the speed of the falling bricks increments as the player gains more scores the player then has less time to make decisions about where and how to fill lines of bricks consequently the game becomes more interesting and challenging our project we developed an avr tetris game system that allows a player to play tetris via an atmel microprocessor the avr atmega163 microprocessor a graphics lcd display a few push buttons and a speaker are integrated into the system we selected atmega163's port a to interface with the push buttons port b & c to interface with the lcd and port d to the speaker in order to generate pulse width modulated pwm signal we developed our hardware interface by first designing block diagrams for each system component as well as the interconnections among these subsystems second we implemented our design by building circuits and testing functionalities for each system block third we integrated our system by soldering each component to the microprocessor and powering up the chip on the other hand we developed our software interface by first designing the high level software architecture and define functionalities second we wrote c codes and tested each subroutine finally we integrated and debugged the source codes and optimized the memory consumption details hardware software design conclusions references pictures
