slac pub 7970 on vanishing two loop cosmological constants in nonsupersymmetric strings slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7970 on vanishing two loop cosmological constants in nonsupersymmetric strings abstract it has recently been suggested that in certain special nonsupersymmetric type ii string compactifications at least the first two perturbative contributions to the cosmological constant lambda vanish support for perturbative vanishing beyond 1 loop as well as evidence for the absence of some nonperturbative contributions has come from duality arguments there was also a direct 2 loop computation which was incomplete in this note we explain the deficiency of the previous 2 loop calculation and discuss the complete 2 loop computation in two different models the corrected analysis yields a vanishing 2 loop contribution to lambda in these models full text pdf slac pub 7970 184 kb compressed postscript slac pub 7970 58 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
