radio frequency poinitng algorithm for the search of ultra high energy neutrinos page 1 radio frequency poinitng algorithm for the search of ultra high energy neutrinos andrew romero wolf march 27 2008 abstract anita is searching for impulsive radio frequency rf emissions from ultra high energy neutrino interactions with the antarctic ice sheet with no known physics backgrounds the data analysis demands an effective method for the rejection of anthropogenic rf sources a highly accurate interferometry based rf pointing algorithm for the anita experiment has been developed for the search of isolated pulses in the successful 35 day flight of anita the fundamentals calibration and performance of the pointing algorithm and rejection techniques are presented here 1
