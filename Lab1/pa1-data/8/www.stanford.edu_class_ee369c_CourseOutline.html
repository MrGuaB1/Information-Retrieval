ee369c home course info course outline instructor materials assignments lecture notes solutions data evaluation final project course outline overview the course starts with a review of sampling and reconstruction in one and multiple dimensions then it goes on to look at several fundamental problems that occur in medical imaging systems reconstruction from frequency domain data reconstruction from projection data hybrid systems that combine both image and frequency domain information systems where the data is fundamentally undersampled and systems where a time series of images is reconstructed this will provide a wide range of tools for the final projects to use during the last few weeks we will look at specific systems including 3d ct systems and pet systems the last week will be devoted to well studied and well known imaging problems in mri outline week 0 course introduction week 1 sampling and reconstruction sampling and reconstruction in 1d sampling reconstruction and resampling in 2d week 2 frequency domain data image reconstruction from sampled frequency domain data non cartesian reconstruction gridding and the nufft examples from mri week 3 automatic focusing off resonance correction in mri automatic focusing weeks 4 image and frequency domain encoded data reconstruction from image and frequency domain encoded data parallel imaging in mri the sense and grappa algorithms week 5 compressed sensing reconstruction from undersampled data compressed sensing examples from mri week 6 compressed sensing and project ideas week 7 projection data image reconstruction from projection data fan beam reconstruction filtered backprojection and rebinning examples from ct week 8 pet reconstruction pet system models iterative reconstruction algorithms week 9 special topics 3d and spiral ct projection operator perspective of imaging systems page generated 2011 12 04 14 18 12 pst by jemdoc
