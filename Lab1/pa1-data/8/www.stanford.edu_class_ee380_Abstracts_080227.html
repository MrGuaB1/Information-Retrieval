abstract bio stanford ee computer systems colloquium 4 15pm wednesday february 27 2008 hp auditorium gates computer science building b01 http ee380 stanford edu scalable parallel programming with cuda on manycore gpus john nickolls nvidia about the talk the cuda scalable parallel programming model provides readily understood abstractions that free programmers to focus on efficient parallel algorithms it uses a hierarchy of thread groups shared memory and barrier synchronization to express fine grained and coarse grained parallelism using sequential c code for one thread since cuda was released in 2007 developers have written scalable parallel programs for a wide range of applications including computational chemistry sparse matrix solvers sorting searching and physics models these applications scale transparently to hundreds of processor cores and thousands of concurrent threads nvidia gpus with the new tesla unified graphics and computing architecture run cuda programs and are widely avaialable in laptops pcs workstations and servers the tesla architecture is massively multithreaded and scales to over one hundred processor cores www nvidia com cuda slides download slides for this talk in pdf format about the speaker john nickolls is director of architecture at nvidia for gpu computing he was previously with broadcom silicon spice sun microsystems and was a co founder of maspar computer his interests include parallel processing systems languages and architectures nickolls has a bs in electrical engineering and computer science from the university of illinois and ms and phd degrees in electrical engineering from stanford university contact information john nickolls nvidia 2701 san tomas expressway santa clara ca 95050 jnickolls nvidia com
