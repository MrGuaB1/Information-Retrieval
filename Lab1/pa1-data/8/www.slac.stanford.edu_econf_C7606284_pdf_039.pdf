main ring beam halo page 1 main ring beam halo fr huson d jovanovic we have estimated the beam halo near the main ring beam from two different sources the first simply considers the loss of protons from the stable orbit be it due to orbit instabilities or gas coulomb scattering the second calculates the flux of charged particles due to nuclear beam gas interactions 1 the lifetime of stored beam in the accelerator is about 18 minutes 1000 seconds therefore the beam crossing an area at 1 cm radius for 1.5 x 10 13 circulating protons is 7 x 10 13 protons 1 10 3 seconds 21ti0 5 cm x 21t cm 2 the flux of charged particles caused by nuclear beam gas interactions is estimated as follows vacuum 10 7 torr 10 10 atm 1.3 x 10 13 gr 3 cm anuclear 60 gr cm 2 proton i 5 a 2 x 10 int cm proton protons x 2 x 10 15 into x 6 particles turn cm proton into 2 o x 1 0 6 s e co na s z rr ctil turn 1.5 x 10 3 particles cm2_sec it is interesting that both numbers are similar both processes undoubtedly are in effect and therefore the above estimates should be taken as lower limit page 2 602 the measured halo from franzini's experiment e3zl at co for 0 1.5 x 10 13 circulating protons is r 1 em i i x 10 7 0 10 e r 1 25 em i 1 x 0 10 12_ r 1.5 cm i 1 x 0 their values are obtained by comparing interaction rates of the beam with the hz jet 10 egr cm3 to interaction rates of halo with the jet nozzle 1 gr cm 2 the conclusion from this data is that there is a beam halo kithin 1.25 em of the beam outside of that radius is background from beam gas interactions with a storage ring with better vacuum this would be reduced
