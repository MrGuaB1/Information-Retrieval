spectrometer design questions spectrometer design questions what is maximum field that 29d36 can be run at this impacts on final horizontal size of detectors need 80 cm wide for 1.5 tm but only 60 cm for 2.0 tm higher filed makes small resolution improvement what should drift between 29d36 and lass dipole be proposal has 0 cm which seems impractical a drift of 50 cm results in slight acceptance loss and slight resolution improvement studies show that alumina should start as close to target as possible for best resolution but some small gap is needed how big should this be how long does alumina need to be shorter length improves resolution but increases singles rates how much integral bdl can we achieve in lass dipole who will do the detailed design of the shim pieces gap in front can be smaller than gap at back is detailed field mapping needed should the original lass power supply be re furbished this allows more flexibility in commisioning and scheduling
