heavy flavor averaging group results home results documentation organization oscillations semileptonic rare decays unitarity triangle click subgroup above for detailed averages in each group next update will be for winter 2005 summary of average as of summer04 ichep fpcp04 write up hep ex 0412073 note we do not scale the error of an average as is presently done by the particle data group in case &chi 2 dof & 1 where dof is the number of degrees of freedom in the average calculation in this case we examine the systematics of each measurement and try to understand them unless we find possible systematic discrepancies between the measurements we do not make any special treatment for the calculated error we provide the confidence level of the fit so that one can know the consistency of the measurements included in the average we attach a warning message in case that some special treatment is done or the approximation used in the average calculation may not be good enough eg gaussian error is used in averaging though the likelihood indicates non gaussian behavior this page is maintained by d kirkby and y sakai and was last updated on 3 jan 2005 site meter
