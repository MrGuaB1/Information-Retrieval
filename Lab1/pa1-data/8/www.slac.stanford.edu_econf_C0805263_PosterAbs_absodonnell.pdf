muon tracking for optimized background rejection at kamland page 1 muon tracking for optimized background rejection at kamland thomas o donnell for the kamland collaboration kamland has demonstrated convincingly that neutrinos oscillate the experiment has determined the neutrino oscillation parameter m2 12 to unprecedented precision has helped constrain the neutrino mixing angle 12 and has explored the potential application of neutrinos as a geophysical probe the heart of the detector is 1 k ton of carbon based scintillator located underground in japan a purification upgrade is currently underway which will enable kamland to execute a low energy solar neutrino program in parallel with the anti neutrino program like many underground experiments fast neutrons and other spallation products from cosmic ray muons present challenging backgrounds in many cases these backgrounds can be mitigated by appropriate timing and spacial vetoes high muon tracking resolution is desirable to achieve efficient vetoes while maximizing detector exposure a new auxiliary muon tracking system is being commissioned to study muons and further characterize post muon events at kamland this system and the expected impact for cno pep solar neutrino observation will be described
