shmuel shaffer cisco systems lecture may 2 2011 www stanford edu class ee392n data networking and computation dr shmuel shaffer senior director smart grid cisco systems bio dr shaffer has extensive experience leading development teams from inception through numerous product releases prior to joining smart grid he was responsible for the development of cisco's radio over ip interoperability roip and collaboration system self service and the low and mid market call center applications before joining cisco in 1999 dr shaffer held managerial positions at siemens rolm where he headed the voice over ip voip development the us hardware organization and the embedded sw development dr shaffer received his ph d from stanford university in the area of adaptive self optimizing systems he also holds two masters degrees from stanford in electrical engineering and in statistics dr shaffer has authored over 250 us patents abstract the smart grid is fundamental to our ability to meet the growing energy needs of our society ip communication is one of the key components of the smart grid in addition to providing a means for communication the cpus of routers and switches can perform some of the smart grid algorithms in essence the communication network can also serve as a distributed computation platform while current research has mainly focused on the development of optimization algorithms executed centrally in the headend it is proposed that future research be focused on the development of algorithms which can be factored and executed on the distributed computation platform provided by the ip network while current research has focused on the how to optimize new research should also focus on where to compute the various components of each algorithm lecture notes lecture 6 charts in pdf
