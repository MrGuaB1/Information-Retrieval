slac r 510 measurement of the polarized forward backward asymmetry of b quarks at sld slac slac pubs and reports slac r 510 measurement of the polarized forward backward asymmetry of b quarks at sld abstract this thesis presents a direct measurement of the parity violating parameter a b using the left right forward backward asymmetry of b anti b pair production at the z 0 pole the measurement was done at the stanford linear accelerator center slac using data from the slac large detector sld we take advantage of the high polarization of the slac linear collider slc electron beam to identify heavy avour decays of the z 0 we use a b tag based on the topological reconstruction of the mass of the b vertex discrimination between the b and anti b quark directions is provided by a self calibrating jet charge technique this technique allows calibration of the analyzing power from data and gives a much reduced model dependence based on our 1994 95 1993 sample of 100000 50000 z 0 decays recorded with an electron beam polarization of p e 77 63 we have obtained a b 0.911 0.045 stat 0.045 syst this value is in good agreement with the standard model full text pdf slac r 510 1.26 mb compressed postscript not available for this document more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 12 jun 2006 11 56 pdt by htmlme pl
