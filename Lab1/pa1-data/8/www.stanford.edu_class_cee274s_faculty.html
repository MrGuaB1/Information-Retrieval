hopkins microbiology course introduction syllabus experiments faculty guest speakers photos application faculty alfred spormann is professor of microbiology in the departments of civil and environmental engineering and chemical engineering at stanford university california research interests focus on the molecular bases of metabolic genetic and ecological interactions of microbes in complex environments in particular his group investigates the biochemistry and signaling pathways involved in acclimation of microbes to changing environments as well as the genetic adaptation and evolution of novel traits in biofilm environments another thrust is directed towards understanding the biochemistry and evolution of degradation pathways of anthropogenic chemicals chris francis is assistant professor of microbial ecology in the department of environmental earth system science at stanford university research interests center on the molecular biochemical and ecological aspects of the microbial geochemical cycling of nitrogen and metals in the environment he is particularly interested in determining the key organisms functional genes and molecular mechanisms underlying these biogeochemical processes through both laboratory and field studies paul rainey is professor of evolutionary genetics at the nz institute for advanced study massey university auckland he is also director of the allan wilson centre for molecular ecology and evolution visiting professor at stanford and senior adjunct researcher at eawag zurich his research concerns the fit between organisms and their environment he is interested in the traits that determine this fit and in the evolution of these traits by natural selection rainey's laboratory spans the field of experimental evolution microbial genetics and population genetics
