reno reactor experiment for neutrino oscillation at yonggwang page 1 reno reactor experiment for neutrino oscillation at yonggwang jaison lee for the reno collaboration department of physics and astronomy seoul national university seoul 151 742 korea e mail jsahnlee gmail com abstract the reno experiment is under construction to measure the value of the smallest and unknown neutrino mixing angle  13 the experiment will compare the measured fluxes of electron antineutrinos at two detectors located at 290 m and 1.4 km distances from the center of the yonggwang nuclear reactors in korea it is planned to start data taking in early 2010 an estimated systematic uncertainty associated with the measurement is less than 0.6 with three years of data the experiment will search for the mixing angle values of sin 2 2 13 down to 0.02
