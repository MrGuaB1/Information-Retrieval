a simple nonlinear prediction pyramid coder home previous next 3 a simple nonlinear prediction in this section we replace the filter and the interpolator in the previous section by a nonlinear one these are introduced by florencio and schafer 2 however they used closed loop pyramid while we stick to the same structure open loop pyramid again the quantizer are fixed with the same step sizes as the previous section filter in this section we don t use any filter the higher level image in the gaussian pyramid is just a subsampled version of the lower level image interpolator the interpolator works as follows we have a lower resolution image represented by the white pixels in the above figure we want to interpolate all the pixels shown there are four categories white pixels let y 2i 2j x i j red pixels consider the one in the middle let y 2i 2j 1 be the weighted median of x i 1 j x i 1 j 1 x i j x i j 1 x i 1 j x i 1 j 1 with weight 1 1 3 3 1 1 respectively blue pixels for y 2i 1 2j compute the weighted median similar to the red pixels but on the symmetric side green pixels let y 2i 1 2j 1 be the median of x i j x i 1 j x i j 1 x i 1 j 1 where x represents the higher level image pixel and y represents the interpolated pixels the reconstructed image is shown below reconstructed image using nonlinear prediction we can see some improvement over the linear prediction edges are preserved and blurring effect is reduced the psnr and the bit rate are shown in the table below comparing to the linear gaussian filter and interpolator psnr db bit rate bit pixel burt adelson 32.77 0.8278 subsampling and weighted median interpolator 34.00 0.6544 home previous next
