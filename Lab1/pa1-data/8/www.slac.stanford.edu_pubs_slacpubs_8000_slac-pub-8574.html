slac pub 8574 slac linac rf performance for lcls slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8574 slac linac rf performance for lcls abstract the linac coherent light source lcls project at slac uses a dense 15 gev electron beam passing through a long undulator to generate extremely bright x rays at 1.5 angstroms the project requires electron bunches with a nominal peak current of 3.5 ka and bunch lengths of 0.020 mm 70fs the bunch compression techniques used to achieve the high brightness impose challenging tolerances on the accelerator rf phase and amplitude the results of measurements on the existing slac linac rf phase and amplitude stability are summarised and improvements needed to meet the lcls tolerances are discussed full text pdf slac pub 8574 44.3 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8574 42.5 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
