untitled document epidemiology and country information pinworm infestations have been recorded across an enormous geographic range it is estimated that more than 209 million people are infested worldwide but while the worm has the ability to persist in tropical climates it is much more frequently described as a nematode found in temperate climates this is largely due to the fact that most other known parasites exist almost exclusively in tropical environments so the relative public health threat posed by pinworm in these locations is very small http www wcpfs org e vermicularis has been labeled the most common helminthic parasite in the sanitary areas of the world as such the united states and western europe are often identified as endemic areas it is estimated that more than 10 of the population of the united states approximately 40 million people is infested with pinworm with a higher incidence among children than adults in certain communities in the us and western europe prevalence rates of 100 have been reported enterobiasis affects people at all levels of the socio economic spectrum however outbreaks are more likely to occur among groups of lower ses this correlation is directly related to the enhanced ability of pinworm to spread in crowded indoor living areas and in overcrowded schools schools where children are packed tightly into classrooms are frequently the sites of widespread pinworm infestations and as a result are often the subjects of scientific inquiry pinworm also shows increased infestation rates in areas where poor personal and community hygiene are practiced
