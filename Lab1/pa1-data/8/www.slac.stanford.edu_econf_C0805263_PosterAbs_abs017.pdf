using the recent results of k meissner and h nicolai in their article neutrinos axion and conformal symmetry arxiv page 1 using the recent results of k meissner and h nicolai in their article neutrinos axion and conformal symmetry arxiv 0803.2814 v2 we can and do refer to their derived conditions for which the classically conformable lagrangian may be built up to eliminate both the higgs and the necessity of susy for a viable axion candidate we claim that this elimination of susy will provide conditions to check if or not there are more than three generations of fermions note that the standard model has three generations of fermions if there are shown to be more than three then the standard model is incorrect and needs to be adjusted as an example calling for a fourth sterile neutrino for example constitutes an extension of the current standard model we also claim that proper analysis of axion production will allow us to study axion graviton scattering and shed light as to difficulties in detecting determining if or not primordial graviton cosmic background radiation exists
