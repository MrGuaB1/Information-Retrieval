links between cp violation in leptogenesis and low energy supersymmetry 1 abstract page 1 links between cp violation in leptogenesis and low energy supersymmetry sacha davidson julia garayoa federica palorini and nuria rius 1 abstract the seesaw mechanism makes leptogenesis a very attractive solution to the baryon asym metry problem if the baryon asymmetry of the universe bau was made via lepto genesis any observation of cp violation in the lepton sector for instance cp violation in neutrino oscillations would support leptogenesis by demonstrating that cp is not a symmetry of leptons the question is whether a stronger link exists between cp violation at low energies and leptogenesis in our work we address this question in the framework of a supersymmetric scenario where new constraints given by the low energy footprints of the high energy theory can be imposed namely the current experimental bounds on lepton flavour violating processes li lj and electric dipole moments of the charged leptons by using the mcmc we perform a parameter scan looking for points that are com patible with the experimental constraints and produce enough bau we find that as in the non supersymmetric case the bau is independent of the low energy phases we also state that is quite difficult in minimal supergravity to obtain the measured bau and at the same time escape the gravitino problem 1
