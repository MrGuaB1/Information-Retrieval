collective three flavor oscillations of supernova neutrinos abstract references page 1 collective three flavor oscillations of supernova neutrinos basudeb dasgupta tata institute of fundamental research homi bhabha road mumbai 400005 india abstract neutrinos of different energies can undergo flavor conversion collectively when their number densities are sufficiently large eg neutrinos emitted from a core collapse super nova a formalism that describes such collective phenomena in the three flavor framework is presented it is shown that the flavor evolution may be factorized into well known two flavor transformations viz synchronized oscillations bipolar oscillations and spectral split with hierarchical frequencies application of these ideas to a typical sn predicts interesting signals at large neutrino detectors eg mass hierarchy determination even at extremely small values of 13 references 1 basudeb dasgupta and amol dighe collective three flavor oscillations of super nova neutrinos hep ph 0712.3798 2 basudeb dasgupta amol dighe and alessandro mirizzi identifying neutrino mass hierarchy at extremely small 13 through earth matter effects in a supernova signal hep ph 0802.1481 1
