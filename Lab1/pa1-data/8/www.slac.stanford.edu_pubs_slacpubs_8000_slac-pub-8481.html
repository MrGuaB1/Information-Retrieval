slac pub 8481 upgrade of the pep ii low beta optics slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8481 upgrade of the pep ii low beta optics abstract the successful commissioning and operation of the pep ii asymmetric e e collider motivated further studies to increase luminosity in this paper we discuss a modification of the pep ii lattice to reduce the vertical beta function at the interaction point ip from the design value of beta y 1.5cm to 1.0cm this could potentially reduce the colliding beam size increase the particle density at ip and the probability of beam beam interactions in this paper we outline the optics modifications discuss tracking simulations and overview machine implementation full text pdf slac pub 8481 254 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8481 119 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
