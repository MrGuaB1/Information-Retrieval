eh&s group name here page 1 ohs report 02 099a 06 26 08 electrical safety the danger of injury through electrical shock is present whenever electrical power is used all electrical equipment should be adequately insulated grounded or isolated to prevent bodily contact with any source of dangerous potentials under certain conditions people can be injured severely even from relatively low voltages coupled with high current the primary effects of electrical shock are due to current actually flowing through the body electrical burns occur when the body or a part of it completes a circuit connecting the power source with the ground although the resistance of dry unbroken skin to electric current is relatively high the amount of current necessary to kill a person is small therefore it is easy to exceed lethal levels of current flow especially if the skin is broken wet or damp with sweat if your equipment runs erratically of if you feel an electrical tingle when you touch it stop using the tool tag it and have it repaired whenever the risk of electrocution is high wear the right protective clothing insulated gloves eye protection boots and head gear if you are not sure what to wear ask your supervisor or contact eh&s for assistance general electrical safety is currently addressed in the general safety training ehs 103 specific electrical hazards and safe practices are to be covered locally by supervisors via safety training on standard operating procedures below are basic electrical safety rules taken from stanford university's code of safe practices 1 immediately report damaged malfunctioning items to supervisor and take out of service until repaired by a qualified electrician 2 equipment and handheld tools should have 3 prong plugs and or double insulation 3 portable electric tools shall not be lifted or lowered by means of the power cord ropes shall be used 4 use ground fault circuit interrupter gfci type outlets or portable gfcis when possible esp outdoors or other potentially wet areas 5 for any tool equipment that generates heat unplug when not in use 6 avoid using extension cords as permanent wiring 90 days 7 do not daisy chain extension cords and or power strips environmental health & safety 480 oak rd stanford ca 94305 8007 t 650.723 0448 f 650.725 3468 http ehs stanford edu page 2 environmental health & safety 480 oak rd stanford ca 94305 8007 t 650.723 0448 f 650.725 3468 http ehs stanford edu 8 prevent damage to the cord and plug ie avoid using nails to secure cord avoid placing in walkways driveways 9 only use extension cords rated for the equipment power needs 10 avoid overloading electrical outlets 11 label all circuit box switches 12 leave at least 36 clearance in front of electrical panels 13 ensure no energized or circuits parts are exposed ie outlet cover plates electrical panel doors 14 never repair modify electrical wiring unless shop specific training is provided contact the university's electric shop x3 1836 for assistance for more information please contact the eh&s occupational health and safety program at 725 3209
