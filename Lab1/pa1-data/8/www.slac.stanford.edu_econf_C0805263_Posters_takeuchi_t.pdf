future constrains on and from lepton universality page 1 future constrains on and from lepton universality tatsu takeuchi virginia tech these contributions are constrained by various types of new physics lead to the violation of charged current lepton universality example r parity violation current 95 bounds experimental bounds on cc lepton universality are expected to improve dramatically in the near future pienu triumf aims to reduce the error on r by a factor of 5 pen psi aims to reduce the error on r by a factor of 6 combined they will reduce the error on r by a factor of 8 babar is analyzing its  data 500 million   pairs and aims to reduce the errors on all the one prong branching fractions of the tau by a factor of 3 belle also has a large  data set 700 million   pairs and growing the analysis of which can improve the limit further the tevatron run 2 has accumulated about 4000 pb 1 of data of which only a fraction has been analyzed for lepton universality in w decays may confirm the 2 sigma difference between the tau and mu e branching fractions seen by lep2 to quantify how the constraints will improve allow cc couplings to be flavor dependent and perform global fit current bounds blowup of current bounds with expected improvement from pienu and belle if cc lepton universality violation is due to the mixing of neutrinos with heavy gauge singlet states then nc observables from lep sld can also be used to constrain epsilon's future high statistics neutrino scattering experiments such as nusong can potentially improve the limits further with pen and belle the ellipse will shrink even further if the ellipse shrinks off the origin as shown it will be a clear signature of new physics fit with the epsilons and the oblique correction parameters yield
