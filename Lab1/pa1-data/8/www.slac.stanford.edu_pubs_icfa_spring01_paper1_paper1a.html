iib spring 2001 paper no 1 a sharma gaseous micropattern detectors high energy physics and beyond full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract multiwire gaseous detectors have matured in the last few decades with major implications in particle physics experiments they have also been successfully refined for use in other fields x rays for medical imaging uv and single photon detection neutron and crystal diffraction studies etc their major limitation has been a modest rate capability 10 3 mm 2 in the last decade several micropattern position sensitive gas devices have been introduced with an inherently improved rate capability few mhz mm 2 and a localization accuracy of 40 50  they are being extensively pursued for their application in several fields the state of the art of this new generation of gaseous detectors will be reviewed full article last modified 9 april 2001 j schwiening
