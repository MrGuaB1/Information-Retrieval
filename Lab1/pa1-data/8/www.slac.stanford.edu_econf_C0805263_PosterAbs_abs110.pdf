title search for supernova relic neutrino at super kamiokande author takashi iida for super kamiokande collaboration abstract page 1 title search for supernova relic neutrino at super kamiokande author takashi iida for super kamiokande collaboration abstract supernova relic neutrinos srn is diffuse supernova neutrino background from all past supernova no experiments has succeeded in detecting srn yet in this poster a search for srn conducted at super kamiokande sk is presented sk is a large water cherenkov detecter in kamioka japan in this analysis 791 days data taken in the second phase of sk sk ii was used and antineutrino signals in the neutrino energy range above 19.3 mev were searched the observed spectrum is consistent with the expected background spectrum and a flux upper limit of 3.68 cm 2 sec was obtained with 90 confidence level a similar search using sk i data gave a flux upper limit of 1.25 cm 2 sec by the combined analysis of sk i and sk ii a flux upper limit of 1.08 cm 2 sec was obtained for the future we are planning to improve the sensitivity of the search by enlarging the fiducial volume reducing deadtime of the cuts and lowering energy threshold of the analysis current status of the improvements is also mentioned
