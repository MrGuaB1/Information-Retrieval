iib fall 99 paper no 2 archana sharma a how to approach for a 3d simulation of charge transfer characteristics in a gas electron multiplier gem full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract in this paper a detailed description of how to simulate charge transfer processes in a gaseous device is presented taking the gas electron multiplier gem as an example a 3 dimensional simulation of the electric field and avalanche is performed results on charge transport are compared to experiment and agree within experimental errors avalanche mechanism and positive ion feedback are studied the procedures used in the simulation are described in detail and program scripts are appended last modified 17 dec 1999 jochen
