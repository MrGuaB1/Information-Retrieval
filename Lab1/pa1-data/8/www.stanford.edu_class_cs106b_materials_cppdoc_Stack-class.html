class stack valuetype the stanford c++ libraries include stack h class stack valuetype this class models a linear structure called a stack in which values are added and removed only from one end this discipline gives rise to a last in first out behavior lifo that is the defining feature of stacks the fundamental stack operations are push add to top and pop remove from top constructor stack initializes a new empty stack methods size returns the number of values in this stack isempty returns true if this stack contains no elements clear removes all elements from this stack push value pushes the specified value onto this stack pop removes the top element from this stack and returns it peek returns the value of top element from this stack without removing it constructor detail stack initializes a new empty stack usage stack valuetype stack method detail int size returns the number of values in this stack usage int n stack size bool isempty returns true if this stack contains no elements usage if stack isempty void clear removes all elements from this stack usage stack clear void push valuetype value pushes the specified value onto this stack usage stack push value valuetype pop removes the top element from this stack and returns it this method signals an error if called on an empty stack usage valuetype top stack pop valuetype peek valuetype & top returns the value of top element from this stack without removing it this method signals an error if called on an empty stack for compatibility with the stl classes this method is also exported under the name top in which case it returns the value by reference usage valuetype top stack peek
