babesiosis transmission transmission vectors image 5 the ixodid tick is the definitive host as well as biological vector of babesia of the seven species of ixodid ticks babesia has been found in six b microti the parasite that causes the most cases of human babesiosis can only be found in ticks from the genus ixodes of which there are 250 species worldwide and 35 in north america 10 in the us b microti is most often transmitted by the black legged tick ixodes scapularis b divergen which is the root of most european cases of babesiosis is found in the tick ixodes ricinus 8 reservoirs image 6 the primary reservoir for b microti is the white footed mouse peromyscus leucopus in endemic areas up to 60 of the mice can be infected 10 b divergens and b microti are not limited to this host both species can be found in a wide range of rodents including the meadow vole the cottontail rabbit the short tailed shrew and others as well as small mammals primates cattle and even birds 8 transmission image 7 babesia microti and babesia divergens is transmitted to humans when an infected tick takes a blood meal in order for the parasite to be transmitted the tick must be attached to the skin for 36 to 48 hours both immature and mature ticks can transmit babesia but older ticks are more likely to be seen and removed and also are prevalent during the fall when people are less active compared to the summer season 10 babesiosis can also be contracted through blood transfusions though the magnitude of the risk is debated in scientific literature while one study claims that the risk of acquiring babesia is only 17 another study has suggested that in endemic areas transfusion transmitted babesiosis is more prevalent than usually believed 2 the research also concludes that since donated blood is often transported the risk of contracting babesiosis even in non endemic area has become much higher
