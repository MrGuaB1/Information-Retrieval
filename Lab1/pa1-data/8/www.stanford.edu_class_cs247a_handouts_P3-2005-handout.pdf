p3 nearly invisible computing page 1 cs 247a human computer interaction design studio klemmer verplank winter 2005 p3 nearly invisible computing due tuesday february 15 there is more to life than interacting with computers and it's time for computer designers to deal with it as computers become smaller and more ubiquitous migrating from the desktop to your home your car or even your back pocket it is increasingly important that their interactions be designed in ways that do not require your undivided attention at the same time it is also important for the computer to be able to get your attention at the appropriate moment an interaction that does a good job of choreographing the user's attention can be immensely helpful a poorly choreographed interaction can be enormously irritating and even dangerous another aspect of limited attention is the limited bandwidth the computer has to communicate how it works a good metaphor well organized visual design and clear concept can help users understand how to get what they want out of the interaction without holding them up challenge select a scenario in which a computing device needs to command a variable amount of a user's attention represent the task and the user's changing attentional and cognitive state explore and develop an interface with variable visibility that adapts to the dynamics of the situation and is easy to understand goals the goals for this project are to gain experience in developing attentional models through observation participation and interrogation identifying mental models and eliciting them from other people finding and creating appropriate metaphors conceptual models and organizing principles designing an interactive techniques to grab attention and let it go constructing a working interactive prototype that someone else can use schedule thursday january 27 proposal brainstorm at least 30 ideas for a simple concept process or phenomenon related to nearly invisible computing that you would like to explore express these schematic form and record them in your idea log bring in a simple one page text graphic proposal describing your favorite concept or process from your list include a brief outline of your target scenario tuesday february 1 models and metaphors in your idea log explore alternatives for organizing principles metaphors models and representations that might be used for organizing your selected application identify content elements text images simulations that might support your interactive experience formulate a structure for organizing the content and interactive components and represent this structure in a simple diagram explore in sketch form a range of ideas for interaction models and how they could work to create insight move from simple page turning to simulations and interactive games thursday february 3 storyboard and flipbook describe your interactive experience in the form of a storyboard show what the parts are how they work together and the inputs and controls that we use to make it all work incorporate the user's attention and mental states in the storyboard create a flipbook that can be used in class to demonstrate and test your project idea on other class members thursday february 10 functional prototype translate your interaction sequence into an interactive experience that conveys the core concept of your project after class refine this component and add supporting material as needed page 2 cs 247a human computer interaction design studio klemmer verplank winter 2005 tuesday february 15 working prototype present your project for demonstration in class it will be driven by another person who must be able to have a complete experience in no more than 5 minutes turn in an updated storyboard showing the final interaction sequence in your idea log record a reflection on your own experience working on this project optional readings nielsen j noncommand user interfaces commun acm 36 4 1993 82 99 weiser m the computer for the 21st century scientific american 1991 265 3 pp 94 104 wisneski c ishii h dahley a gorbet m brave s ullmer b and yarin p ambient displays turning architectural space into an interface between people and digital information in proceedings of international workshop on cooperative buildings cobuild 98 darmstadt germany february 1998 springer press pp 22 32
