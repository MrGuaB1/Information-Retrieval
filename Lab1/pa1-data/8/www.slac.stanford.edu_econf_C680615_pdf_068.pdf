c 2 68 94 facilities for small experiments ad krisch and d 1 meyer university of michigan the main conclusion reached page 1 c 2 68 94 facilities for small experiments ad krisch and d 1 meyer university of michigan the main conclusion reached by our subgroup is that in 1972 people will require equipment that our subgroup is not smart enough to foresee we apologize for this shortcoming in our subgroup that was not present in most other subgroups nevertheless we strongly recommend that a fair sum ofmoney $5 million should be made available in 1970 71 to purchase those small to intermediate items less than $1 4 million whose need will become apparent at that time our other recommendation is to immediately start work on devel opment and design of superconducting and cryogenic bending magnets i there will be a need for superconducting analyzing and trans port magnets with 50 kg field and an approximate gap size of 2 in x 5 in x 100 in at least 30 of these will be needed 2 about 15 larger aperture magnets will also be needed for analysis in spark chamber experiments 3 because of the high radiation background near targets septum magnets should probably be cryogenic rather than superconducting at least 10 septums should be built varying in length from 40 in to 120 in 121 page 2 c 2 68 94 2 and in aperture from 1 in x 2 in x 5 in the field should be at least 35 kg the existence of these superconducting and cryogenic magnets will be vital to the counter spark chamber program at nal conse quently we urge that the development of such magnets be started im mediately we also list the following facilities which users will need 1 monitoring of high flux beams radiochemistry pickup coils ionization counters 2 small computers in trailers 3 liquid hydrogen targets and polarized targets 4 a small electronics pool to complement the users own electronics and repair equipment 122
