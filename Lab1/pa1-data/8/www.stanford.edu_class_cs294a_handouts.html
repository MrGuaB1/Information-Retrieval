cs294a cs294w unsupervised deep learning cs294a cs294w handouts and enrollment information enrollment doing research in machine learning can be challenging consequently we will be able to work with only a small number of students and enrollment will be limited one of the goals of the class is to help students get involved in long term research specifically it is targeted to full time students who anticipate being at stanford until at least june 2013 thus for example freshmen sophomore or junior students are eligible to take the class as are seniors who have already been admitted to a co term program first year msc students and phd students are also eligible but not senior students co term students or second year msc students who are graduating before june 2012 to quickly get you the background knowledge you ll need to do research in deep learning all students are required to successfully complete a programming assignment on deep learning posted below by wednesday january 12th this programming assignment asks you to implement the sparse autoencoder algorithm if you have taken and mastered the material in cs221 or cs229 including basic matlab programming we believe you should be able to successfully complete this assignment this programming assignment will also give you a lower bound on the pace you can expect in cs294a if you are already involved in ai research or if you already have experience with deep learning algorithms for example if you had previously already implemented a sparse autoencoder you may be exempt from these requirements please contact prof ng if you would like to be considered for an exemption handouts handout 1 course information html handout 2 lecture notes on sparse autoencoders pdf updated 10 00pm jan 11 2011 to fix first and second equation on p 16 handout 3 programming assignment on sparse autoencoders code and data you can also watch lecture video 1 and lecture video 2 on this material these videos from last year are on a slightly different version of the sparse autoencoder than we re using this year comments to cs294a qa cs stanford edu home page
