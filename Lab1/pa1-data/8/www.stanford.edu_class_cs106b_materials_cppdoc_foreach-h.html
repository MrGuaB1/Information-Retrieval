common include foreach h file foreach h this interface defines the foreach keyword which is used to simplify iteration all iterable classes import this interface so clients never need to do so explicitly this version of the interface also supports c++ strings and arrays ifndef _foreach_h define _foreach_h statement foreach usage foreach type var in collection the foreach statement steps through the elements in a collection it works correctly with the collection classes in both the standard template library and the stanford c++ libraries but can also be used with c++ strings and statically initialized arrays the following code for example prints every element in the string vector lines foreach string str in lines cout str endl similarly the following function calculates the sum of the character codes in a string int sumcharactercodes string str int sum 0 foreach char ch in str sum ch return sum as a simplification when iterating over maps the foreach macro iterates through the keys rather than the key value pairs the foreach and in macros are defined in the foreachpriv h file include private foreachpriv h endif
