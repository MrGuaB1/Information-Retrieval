light budget assuming light loss in the fibers page 1 a moiseev 09 25 01 light budget assuming light loss in the fibers the efficiency of tda tile detector assembly has recently been measured and corresponding light yield was estimated the measurements have been performed with relatively short fibers only wsf which collect the light from the tile and deliver it to the pmt in the real design there will be up to 1.5 meters long fiber bundles to deliver the light from the farest in the middle of the top acd surface tiles to the pmt location two cases are considered in this memo the resulting efficiency if no clear fibers are used and light is delivered to pmt by only wsf 1.5 meters long 40 of the light loss and with the use of fiber to fiber connectors and clear fibers to deliver the light to pmt much more transparent fibers the light loss is 15 fig 1 light budget for 1 pmt black line measured efficiency corresponds to 19 pe green line efficiency assuming 15 light loss 16 pe in the fiber connector and clear fibers blue line efficiency assuming 40 light loss 12 pe in 1.5 meters wsf fig 2 light budget for 2 pmts black line measured efficiency green line efficiency assuming 15 light loss blue line efficiency assuming 40 of the light loss page 2 conclusions assuming the acd threshold to be 0.3 of the mip the efficiency of acd can be obtained from shown figures it is seen that there will be very significant efficiency degradation if we do not use clear fibers even running both pmts the required efficiency may not be achieved with 0.3 mip threshold if the light is transmitted only by wsf running one pmt will not provide level of required efficiency 0.9997 even with the use of clear fibers the efficiency can be increased by lowering the thresholds but it will increase the self veto caused by backsplash and also will reduce signal to noise ratio
