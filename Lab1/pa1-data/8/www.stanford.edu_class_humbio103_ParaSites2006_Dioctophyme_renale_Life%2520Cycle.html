life cycle and transmission life cycle & transmisssion dioctophyme eggs are released in the kidneys of a definitive mammalian host and passed through the host's urine over the course of 15 100 days the eggs develop into first stage larva outside of the host and are then ingested by an intermediate host which is almost always an aquatic oligochaete aquatic worm within the intermediate host the larvae molt twice and become infectious 2 transmission occurs when a carnivorous mammal consumes either the intermediate host or a paratenic host an animal such as a fish that has consumed the intermediate host 8 once inside the stomach of the mammalian host the infectious juvenile worms penetrate the stomach walls and over the course of several weeks mature and migrate to the kidneys 8 there is no single specific reservoir for the dioctophyme renale worm it is known to infect a variety of carnivorous mammals such as minks bears canids swine seals and infrequently humans 5 for an image of the life cycle of dioctophyme renale click here
