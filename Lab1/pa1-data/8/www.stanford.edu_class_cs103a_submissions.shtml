cs103a discrete mathematics for computer science cs103a discrete mathematics for computer science autumn 2008 home information staff policies handouts proofs solutions video handouts lecture drawings submitting homework submitting your homework grade grinder questions any lpl question with a saved solutions file is considered a grade grinder question for these we ask that you submit your homework electronically using the lpl submit application listing robert plummer as the professor and cs103a submit gmail com as the professor's email note please do not use cs103a submit gmail com for any purpose other than grade grinder submissions we will be automating the collection of grade grinder reports from this account and will rarely if ever check it manually any questions or written solutions sent to it will likely go unnoticed for long periods of time if you submit your answers to us multiple times we will use the last submission for each problem to use the grade grinder you must purchase a new textbook software package the software must be registered to a particular name and email and once registered thus cannot be changed therefore if you borrow or purchase a used book you cannot submit your solutions or even check them using grade grinder we strongly recommend that you use the grade grinder but it is your choice doing so allows you to check your homework for correctness before submitting and to resubmit in the case of errors thus not using the grade grinder places you at a distinct disadvantage to your peers also the grade grinder expedites the grading process making our lives easier and allowing us to return your graded solutions to you sooner if you choose not to use grade grinder or otherwise cannot you will be required to submit your solutions in the same way as non grade grinder solutions as outlined below other questions paper copies of homework are due by the end of class on the due date
