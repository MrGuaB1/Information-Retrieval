signal reconstruction frequency sampling unit step function integration page 1 lecture 12 ee 104 introduction to communications winter 2003 signal reconstruction frequency sampling unit step function integration lecture outline signal reconstruction via interpolation frequency sampling unit step function integration revisited 1 signal reconstruction via interpolation in frequency domain we recover a signal from its sampled values by passing it through a low pass lter in the time domain this corresponds to convolving the samples with a sinc function the sinc function with fundamental frequency equal to the highest frequency in the signal tracks the signal changes between the sample points 2 sampling in frequency applying duality to nyquist theorem can recover a time limited signal contained in time interval 5t s 5ts from its samples in the frequency domain at rate greater than f s 1 ts sampling in the frequency domain becomes periodic repetition of the time limited signal in the time domain the time limited signal is recovered from the periodic repetition by passing it through a time window 3 unit step function the unit step function u t has value zero for t 0 5 for t 0 and one for t 0 the step function is the integral of the delta function the fourier transform pair for the step function is u t 5 f 1 j2 f 4 integration revisited can de ne integration in terms of the unit step function as y t z t 1 x d z 1 1 x u t d x t u t thus integration becomes a convolution applying fourier transform y f x f 5 f 1 j2 f 5x 0 f x f j2 f consistent with our earlier result but takes care of initial conditions page 2 main points we recover a signal from its samples using sinc interpolation in time same as low pass ltering in frequency sampling in the frequency domain becomes a repetition in time the unit step function allows us to de ne integration as a convolution and obtain its fourier transform
