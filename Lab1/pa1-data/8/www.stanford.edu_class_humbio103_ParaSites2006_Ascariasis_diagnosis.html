untitled document diagnosis images courtesy of http www dpd cdc gov dpdx html ascariasis htm due to the nature of the disease and its generally unobservable symptoms a diagnosis often only occurs after passage of the adult worm however if ascariasis is suspected diagnostic tests can be run to confirm the disease ultrasounds and endoscopes can be used to attempt to image the worms yet the most reliable means to diagnose the disease is the simple stool sample because of the high volume of eggs produced in the duodenum by the adult worm a stool sample can often be placed under a microscope in a formalin wet mount allowing a physician or lab technician to make a diagnosis on the left you can find several images of ascaris eggs in stool samples that can be used to help diagnose a patient lastly immunoserology can be used as the worms often cause elevated igg and ige levels in the blood stream
