slac pub 7898 bunch length and beam timing monitors in the slc final focus slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7898 bunch length and beam timing monitors in the slc final focus abstract during the 1997 98 luminosity run of the stanford linear collider slc two novel rf based detectors were brought into operation in order to monitor the interaction point ip bunch lengths and fluctuations in the relative arrival time of the two colliding beams both bunch length and timing can strongly affect the slc luminosity and had not been monitored in previous years the two new detectors utilize a broad band microwave signal which is excited by the beam through a ceramic gap in the final focus beam pipe and transported outside of the beamline vault by a 160 ft long x band waveguide we describe the estimated luminosity reduction due to bunch length drift and ip timing fluctuation the monitor layout the expected responses and signal levels calibration measurements and beam observations full text pdf slac pub 7898 332 kb compressed postscript slac pub 7898 253 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file created from latex source which may have used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification though the fonts will be legible at slightly higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the type 3 fonts such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
