the future of let studies on the ilc dr near term page 1 the future of let studies on the ilc dr near term james jones astec daresbury laboratory page 2 summary of work so far work has been done to estimate both the uncorrected jitter tolerances and the tolerances with tuning algorithms currently the tuning tolerances have been separated into two essentially disparate algorithms work has started on investigating the effects of stray field errors on the vertical emittance simulation codes have been partially verified against each other and give confidence in the different implementations of emittance calculation page 3 what's next simulations need to be extended to include amongst others a larger variety of error sources a more direct comparison of the various methods of tuning orbit & dispersion correction versus separated dispersion correction orbit correction using dipolar correctors or quadrupole movers coupling bumps where applicable page 4 who's going to do it currently the work described has been performed by a wolski k kubo & j jones effort in this area is currently limited however what is really required investigating and optimising tuning algorithm takes effort and time generating statistics is easy but how good a comparison is needed the future of this area looks brighter possibly two ra's should be available within eurotev by next year to work part time in this area other commitments
