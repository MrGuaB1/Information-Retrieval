mds map algorithm page 1 ee378b statistical signal processing mds map algorithm andrea montanari lecture 9 10 due on 5 3 2011 the file www stanford edu class ee378b cities txt contains the geographic coordinates latitude north and longitude west of 129 cities in us and canada 1 using the fact that the earth's equatorial radius is 6 378 137 m and approximating the earth as a perfect sphere compute the distances between pairs of cities by this we mean the distance to be walked going straight on the earth's surface from one city to the other 2 construct a graph with vertices corresponding to the cities and an edge going from each city to its 6 closest neighbors only the code doing the computation needs to be returned for points 1 and 2 above 3 implement the mds map algorithm apply it in the connectivity only mode to the graph constructed at the previous point and deduce positions in two dimensions for the 129 cities present a plot of these positions 4 repeat the calculation at point 3 by using mds map with the same graph and edege lengths as computed in point 1 also in this case use d 2 in the algorithm
