iib spring 2001 paper no 3 p bourgeois and j va vra corrosion of glass windows in dirc pmts full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract the dirc photon detector contains 11000 photomultipliers pmts which are submerged in ultra pure water this note reports on glass corrosion r&d conducted with pmts in pure water we conclude that only limited number 50 of the pmts in water are affected by rapid corrosion while a majority of the 11000 pmts should last according to our measurements for another ten years the observation of pmt glass corrosion is based on visual observations x ray surface analysis esca surface analysis weight analysis transmission measurement as well as detailed water trace element analysis we also correlate these observations with dirc measurements of water ph factor resistivity temperature transmission and babar analysis of bhabha and di muon events we also compare dirc water purity with that of the super kamiokande and k2k experiments which also use ultra pure water we provide empirical proof that corrosion in our particular borosilicate type of pmt glass window occurs at high rate when the glass has no zn content full article last modified 13 april 2001 j schwiening
