iib spring 99 paper no 2 p fonte a smirnitski and c williams a new high resolution time of flight technology full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract in the framework of the alice collaboration we have recently studied the performance of the multigap resistive plate chambers which were operated in avalanche mode and at atmospheric pressure for time of flight measurements the detector provided an overall detector plus electronics timing accuracy of 120 ps sigma at an efficiency of 98 for mip's the chambers had four 0.3 mm gas gaps limited by both a metallised ceramic plate and a glass plate with an active dimension of 4x4cm 2 the gas mixture contained c 2 h 2 f 4 5 isobutane 10 sf 6 the streamer discharges at a rate level of a few percent each releasing about 20pc were tolerated without any noticeable problem this detector opens the perspectives for affordable and reliable high granularity large area tof detectors with efficiency and time resolution comparable to existing scintillator based tof technology but with significantly up to an order of magnitude a lower price per channel last modified 7 april 1999 jochen
