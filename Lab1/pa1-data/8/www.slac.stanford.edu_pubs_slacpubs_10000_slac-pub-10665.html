slac pub 10665 high power rf distribution system for the 8 pack project slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 10665 high power rf distribution system for the 8 pack project abstract the 8 pack project at slac is a prototype rf system whose goal is to demonstrate the high power x band technology developed in the nlc glc next global linear collider program in its first phase it has reliably produced a 400 ns rf pulse of over 500 mw using a solid state modulator four 11.424 ghz klystrons and a dual moded sled ii pulse compressor 1 in phase 2 the output power of our system has been delivered into the bunker of the nlcta next linear collider test accelerator and divided between several accelerator structures for beam acceleration we describe here the design cold test measurements and processing of this power distribution system due to the high power levels and the need for efficiency overmoded waveguide and components are used for power transport the te01 mode is used in 7.44 cm and 4.064 cm diameter circular waveguide only near the structures is standard wr90 rectangular waveguide employed components used to manipulate the rf power include transitional tapers mode converters overmoded bends fractional directional couplers and hybrids full text pdf slac pub 10665 164 kb compressed postscript not available for this document more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 31 aug 2004 10 15 pdt by htmlme pl
