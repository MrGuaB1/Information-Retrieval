computer systems laboratory colloquium 11 00am wednesday july 29 1998 terman 156 big data and the next wave of infrastress john mashey silicon graphics about the talk data is growing faster than ever with a sudden uptick now expected in disk storage in late 1998 the combination of big data and the net is already creating and will create much more stress on the infrastructure ie infrastress of computing interconnect bandwidths i o systems operating systems disk file systems backup networking where the infrastructure is unable to change as fast as the subsystems cpus dram disks the talk examines various technology trends expected over the next few years tries to pinpoint the likely stress periods and reasons and looks at some of the potential solutions for the problems by accident it appears that several technology trends just happen to be maximizing infrastress in th 1998 2002 period just in time to add to year 2000 problems put another way if you are standing on a dike and you see a big tidal wave coming in the distance you hope that the dike is pretty strong already because you have some building to do scalability of hardware and software high input output performance and mature 64 bit systems provide a good foundation while lack of these will cause excitement for users about the speaker data forthcoming contact data john mashey email mash sgi com ddd 650 933 3090 fax 650 932 3090 usps silicon graphics cray research 6l 005 2011 n shoreline blvd mountain view ca 94043 1389
