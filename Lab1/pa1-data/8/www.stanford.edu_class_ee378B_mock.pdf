mock final page 1 ee378b statistical signal processing mock final andrea montanari this is a mock final it is analogous to the actual final in length and difficulty but not necessarily in structure the objective of this final is to study the locally rigid embedding lre method proposed in a singer a remark on global positioning from local distances proc natl acad sci 2008 vol 105 no 28 9507 9511 this is a positioning algorithm given a graph g v e over n v vertices and distance measurements dij for i j e the algorithm tries to find positions r1 rn in p dimensions such that ri rj 2 dij for each i j e throughout this exercise we assume that the dimension is p 2 and let ri xi yi further we let x x1 x2 xn y y1 y2 yn and u 1 1 1 here is a synthetic description of the algorithm for further details we refer to the original paper posted on the class webpage the idea is to construct a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix s rn n s 0 such that su 0 sx 0 sy 0 1 while v sv 0 strictly whenever v is orthogonal to u x y in order to construct this matrix let c1 cn be a collection of cliques in g whereby ci includes i and its ki closest neighbors for ki p 1 3 suitably chosen for each clique ci find the positions rj j ci up to a rigid motion using multi dimensional mds let uci rki 1 be the all one vector uci 1 1 1 1 and define xci xj j ci and yci yj j ci then construct a symmetric positive matrix pci r ki 1 ki 1 with pci uci pci uci pci uci 0 more precisely pci is the projector orthogonal to uci xci yci this is obtained by constructing eg via gram schmidt orthogonalization ki 2 orthonormal vectors wi 1 wi ki 2 that are orthogonal to uci xci yci and letting pci ki 2 l 1 wi lw i l 2 next let pci rn n be the matrix that is obtained from pci by letting pci jl 0 if j ci or l ci and filling the remaining entries using the corresponding entries of pci in terms of these we let s n i 1 pci finally the positions r1 rn are reconstructed by using the 3 eigenvectors of s corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues one of this is always u the other two yield x y up to an affine transformation 1 prove that the matrix s constructed above is positive semidefinite prove that su 0 and that if the distance measurements dij are exact sx sy 0 2 implement the lre algorithm describe your choice of ki and justify it 1 page 2 3 test your implementation on synthetic data more precisely generate n 1000 iid positions r1 rn uniformly at random in the unit square 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 generate the random geometric graph g by letting i j e if ri rj 2  run the lre algorithm for several values of  and report your results 4 comment on the algorithm complexity 2
