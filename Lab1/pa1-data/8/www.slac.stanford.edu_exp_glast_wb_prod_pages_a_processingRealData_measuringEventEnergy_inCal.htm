measuring energy deposit in the cal measuring energy deposit in the cal note three methods are used to measure the energy deposit in the calorimeter parametric correction can be used for any track use the tracks to characterize the shower by position angle radiation lengths traversed proximity to gaps correct raw energy likelihood limited energy and angular range uses the relation between energy deposit in the last layer and in the rest of the shower note below 50 gev last layer energy is proportional to the leaked energy profile fitting limited angular range fit layer by layer deposit to shower shape note best if shower peak is contained in the calorimeter choose the best answer based on the expected error for each of the three owned by last updated by chuck patterson 03 09 2009 back to top
