iib spring 2004 paper no 3 l latronico micropattern gas detectors with pixel read out full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract micropattern gas detectors with pixel read out are position sensitive proportional counters obtained by coupling a gas amplifying stage provided by a gem detector to a charge collection plane patterned with pixel electrodes advanced pcb techniques offering typical feature size of the order of a few microns are used to construct both stages of these detectors which show high detection efficiency excellent spatial resolution and fast charge collection in this paper it is shown how the design of the read out system can maximize the intrinsic performance of these devices for two practical implementations in the field of x ray astronomy and plasma imaging full article last modified 22 april 2004 j schwiening
