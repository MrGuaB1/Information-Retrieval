sharks attack humans but most sharks don t attack humans how children learn to express generics my talk will examine the challenges that learners face when acquiring generic language eg sharks attack humans generics are both conceptually and linguistically challenging although we experience the world in terms of individual objects and events we must form abstractions that extend beyond these individual entities moreover the same forms of language that are used to express generics are also used to refer to particular individuals compare the dog is a 4 legged animal to the dog is sleeping furthermore simple statistical frequency models are arguably insufficient to account for generic use despite these challenges children the world over acquire generics with surprising ease i discuss different kinds of learning models and suggest that generics are a default mode of generalization for human learners
