cs279 computational methods for analysis and reconstruction of biological networks general info home general info course staff tentative syllabus slides notes paper index assigned readings homeworks resources course description a living cell performs its activity via multiple complex networks of interacting entities which include genes rnas proteins and small molecules these inter related networks include regulatory networks spanning both direct transcriptional regulation and other regulatory mechanisms such as signaling rna degradation or chromatin structure modification networks of protein protein interactions and networks of metabolic reactions where compounds are processed to produce other compounds this new course which lies at the intersection of systems biology and computational biology covers computational methods for understanding and reconstructing these networks for each type of network the course will discuss characterization of network structure in terms of high level structure and basic building blocks understanding the effect of these structural characteristics on network function available biological data that can help reveal aspects of the network and algorithms for reconstructing the network from biological data the course will discuss the interactions between the different types of network and the connection between networks and cellular functions prerequisites the course is intended to be accessible to both biologically and computationally oriented students with some amount of background in both disciplines basic biological concepts at the level of bio41 basic computer science and data structures at the level of cs103 programming skills in some scientific programming language c c++ java or matlab probability and statistics at the level of stats 116 workload the course will be project based with the primary workload consisting of a two part project performed in small inter disciplinary teams combining both biologists and computer scientists in the first part of the project the team will read summarize and critique 3 4 papers relating to a particular topic within the scope of the course continuing on the same topic in the second part each team will design and implement a new computational experiment and analyze the results three small problem sets 5 of the grade each no programming required project deliverable review and critique 30 of the grade friday 10 27 a poster 15 of the grade friday 12 8 a written report 40 of the grade monday 12 11 note some extra credit will be assigned based on class participation textbook the optional textbook covers about 2 weeks of material is an introduction to systems biology design principles of biological circuits by uri alon crc press 2006 communication we strongly recommend asking questions on the newsgroup su class cs279 this forum enables students to discuss problems that they encounter it is also an excellent place to find a group for the project for information on how to access and use class newsgroups see a stanford intro to usenet there is also a homework question queue at cs279 qa cs stanford edu which is monitored by the course staff please include the homework number and question number in the subject line for example hw1 q2
