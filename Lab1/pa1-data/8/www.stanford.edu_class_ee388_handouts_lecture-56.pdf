capacity for the bec graphs density evolution page 1 ee388 modern coding theory capacity for the bec andrea montanari lecture 5 6 4 13 15 2010 ldpc codes achieve capacity over the binary erasure channel the objective of this homework is to implement a sequence of capacity achieving codes and to experiment a little bit with them graphs let us start with a simple question do regular ensembles achieve capacity under message passing decoding arguably the most important post gallager idea in ldpc codes was the use of irregular graphs ie of graphs with nodes of varying degrees the corresponding graph ensemble can be characterized by the following parameters 1 the blocklength n ie the number of transmitted bits 2 the design rate r or equivalently the number of check nodes m n 1 r i am changing notation for the rate 3 two distributions l li and r ri over integers i 1 2 dmax the probability li corresponds to the fraction of variable nodes of degree i it is customary and convenient to encode the two distributions as generating polynomials l x dmax i 0 lixi r x dmax i 0 rixi 1 another equivalent way of describing the graph consists in assigning the edge perspective degree distributions  x l x l 1  x r x r 1 2 these are polynomials  x i ixi 1 and  x i ixi 1 what is the interpretation of  x and  x what about l 1 and r 1 can you determine l x r x from the edge perspective distributions show that design rate is given by r 1 l 1 r 1 3 once the degree distributions are given the graph is sampled uniformly at random among the ones with the prescribed degree distribution of course this is strictly speaking hard to do how would you actually do the sampling density evolution as n the neighborhhod bi t of a uniformly random vertex i converges to a random rooted tree t  t this is a bipartite tree with offspring distributions  for variable nodes and  for check nodes more precisely the probability for a variable node to have i 1 descendants and thus i neighbors is i while for a check node is i 1 page 2 the density evolution equation in this case reads xt 1  1  1 xt 4 with initial condition x0 1 this recursion can also be written as  1 xt 1  1  1 xt show that 1 0  x dx  l 1 1 0 1  1 x dx 1 1 r 1 5 what does this mean what does this imply about capacity achieving degree distributions degree se quences a capacity achieving degree sequence it turns out that for any given degree distributions   with bounded support the threshold erasure prob ability to be denoted as    is strictly less than the information theoretic bound 1 r we will thus resort to a sequence of degree distributions to be denoted by  k  k the design rate of a degree distribution pair will be denoted as r   let  k z zk 1  k z 1  1 1 z 1 k 1 for  0 1 it follows from the taylor expansion of 1 x  that  k l 1 l   1 k 1 1  l  1 k 1 l 2 6 let zl l l 2 k l and define l k  as the smallest value of l such that zl 1 finally set  k l  k l zl k  if l l k  0 otherwise 7 show that  k 1  k 1 x x for all x 0 1 and as a consequence   k  k  hint use the fact that the coefficients l in eq 6 are non negative and hence  k x  k x zl k  show that for any sequence l k  k l k 0 as k deduce that l k  and zl k  1 as k prove that limk r  k  k limk 1 zl k  1  summary at the end of this week you should know 1 why irregular ensembles are good 2 how to define and generate standard irregular codes 3 how to analyze standard irregular ensembles on the erasure channel through density evolution 4 how to optimize irregular ensembles over the erasure channel and construch capacity achieving se quences this material can be found in section 3.15 of mct page 109 onwards 2 page 3 work write a program that generates a random graph from the   ensemble use it to do simulations with the ensemble  k  k defined above for k 4 6 8 10 more precisely i choose a value of  ii compute the corresponding degree distribution  k  k iii generate a random graph with the prescribed degree distribution and blocklength n of your choice iv compute bit error probability curves for transmission over bec  i expect to receive 1 a print out of the code 2 the values of the parameters  n you used 3 a plot of the bit error probability curves 3
