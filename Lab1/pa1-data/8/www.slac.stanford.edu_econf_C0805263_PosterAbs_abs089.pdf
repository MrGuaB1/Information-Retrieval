the majorana neutrinoless double beta decay experiment abstract page 1 the majorana neutrinoless double beta decay experiment vm gehman for the majorana collaboration1 1los alamos national laboratory los alamos nm 87545 dated march 30 2008 abstract the majorana project is a next generation neutrinoless double beta decay 0 experiment that will endeavor to provide evidence as to the majorana or dirac nature of the electron neutrino if the neutrino is a majorana particle 0 measurements will also provide direct limits on the effective majorana mass m of the electron neutrino we present an overview of current plans to build a demonstrator module with an active mass of 60 kg 30 kg of this will be natural germanium and 30 kg will be enriched to 86 in 76ge this mass corresponds to a sensitivity to m 200 mev assuming light majorana neutrino exchange dominates as the mechanism for 0 this phase of the majorana experiment will demonstrate the background levels and experimental techniques necessary to scale up to an detector fielding an active mass of 1000 kg of 76ge corresponding to m sensitivity of 30 mev detector fabrication is a critical issue for performance cost and schedule of a 1000 kg detector array and the collaboration is examining alternative detector technologies including both point contact p type and highly segmented n type diodes during the demonstrator phase of the experiment we will highlight recent majorana technical and r&d achievements and outline a path forward for construction of the demonstrator module electronic address vmg lanl gov 1
