slac pub 8331 quark orbital angular momentum from lattice qcd slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8331 quark orbital angular momentum from lattice qcd abstract we calculate the quark orbital angular momentum of the nucleon from the quark energy momentum tensor form factors on the lattice the disconnected insertion is estimated stochastically which employs the z 2 noise with an unbiased subtraction this reduced the error by a factor of 4 with negligible overhead the total quark contribution to the proton spin is found to be 0.30 0.07 from this and the quark spin content we deduce the quark orbital angular momentum to be 0.17 0.06 which is 34 of the proton spin we further predict that the gluon angular momentum to be 0.20 0.07 ie 40 of the proton spin is due to the glue full text pdf slac pub 8331 196 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8331 106 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
