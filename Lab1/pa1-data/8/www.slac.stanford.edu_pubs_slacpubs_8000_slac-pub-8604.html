slac pub 8604 higher dipole bands in the nlc accelerating structure slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8604 higher dipole bands in the nlc accelerating structure abstract we show that scattering matrix calculations for dipole modes between 23 43 ghz for the 206 cell detuned structure ds are consistent with finite element calculations and results of the uncoupled model in particular the rms sum wake for these bands is comparable to that of the first dipole band we also show that for rdds1 uncoupled wakefield calculations for higher bands are consistent with measurements in particular a clear 26 ghz signal in the short range wake is found in both results full text pdf slac pub 8604 384 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8604 651 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
