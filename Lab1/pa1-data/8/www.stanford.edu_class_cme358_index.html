cme358 course information cme358 the finite element method for fluid mechanics course info announcements course outline references assignments course material thu jan 13 2011 07 06 49 gmt 0800 pst course description this course presents the basic mathematical theory of the finite element method for incompressible flows it also covers related computational algorithms and computer implementation details it is intended primarily for graduate students interested either in developing modern and rigorous skills in the numerical solution of fluid mechanics problems or in developing further their basic skills in the finite element methodology using the poisson equation as a background problem the course begins with a fast review of the basic finite element method for simple elliptic problems next it explains why this basic theory is insufficient for problems such as the mixed formulation of elliptic equations incompressible flows the advection diffusion problem and the navier stokes equations to address such problems the course continues with notions of the mathematical analysis of non coercive partial differential equations the inf sup or babuska brezzi condition and its application to the stokes and darcy problems and a presentation of stable mixed finite element methods and corresponding algebraic solvers stabilization approaches are then discussed in the context of the advection diffusion equation finally the numerical solution of the incompressible navier stokes equations by a suitable finite element method is covered the course material described above is complemented by a balanced set of theoretical computational and matlab computer programming homeworks contact information instructor professor jean frederic gerbeau email jean frederic gerbeau at inria dot fr office durand 028 office hours wednesdays 4 00 to 5 00 pm course assistants paolo massimi email pmassimi at stanford dot edu office durand 023c office hours wednesdays 4 00 to 5 00 pm david amsallem email amsallem at stanford dot edu office durand 028 office hours wednesdays and thursdays 4 00 to 5 00 pm lectures time tuesdays and thursdays 1 15 to 3 05 pm location rm 240 110 prerequisites solid foundations in mutivariable calculus me335a or equivalent also graduate students interested in this course are advised to take me412 cme356 during the previous quarter or earlier textbook there is no required textbook for this class homework there will be assignments due roughly every two weeks collaboration among students is encouraged you should feel free to discuss problems with your fellow students please document on each assignment with whom you worked however you must write your own solutions and copying homework from another student past or present is forbidden the stanford honor code will apply to all assignments both in and out of class exams there will be no midterm there will be a final exam it is open notes and open book grading the course grade will be based on assignments 50 and the final exam 50
