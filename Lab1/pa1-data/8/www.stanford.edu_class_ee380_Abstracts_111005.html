abstract bio stanford ee computer systems colloquium 4 15pm wednesday oct 5 2011 skilling auditorium stanford campus http ee380 stanford edu green clouds and black swans rethinking data centric data center designs parthasarathy ranganathan hp labs about the talk emerging workloads that manage and harvest useful insights from large amounts of data require corresponding new data centric system architecture optimizations in particular with the growing importance of power and cooling a key challenge for such future designs is to achieve higher performance at better energy efficiency at the same time emerging technology inflections provide a unique opportunity for novel redesigns at both the hardware and software levels in this talk i will provide an overview of how the data centric data center project at hp labs is addressing these opportunities i will specifically focus on a few examples dematerialized datacenters a new datacenter design iteratively co designed across system architecture and physical organization packaging to improve environmental sustainability and nanostores a new system architecture design using emerging non volatile memories and optics to eliminate nonessential caching layers and provide balanced computation co located with the data about the speaker partha ranganathan is a corporate fellow at hewlett packard labs where he currently leads a research program on future data centric data centers his research interests are in systems architecture and manageability energy efficiency and systems modeling and evaluation he has done extensive work in these areas including key contributions around energy aware user interfaces heterogeneous multi core processors power capping and power aware server designs federated enterprise power management energy modeling and benchmarking disaggregated blade server architectures and most recently storage hierarchy and systems redesign for non volatile memory dr ranganathan's work has had broad impact on industry and academia and has been featured in various venues including the new york times wall street journal business week san francisco chronicle times of india slashdot youtube and tom's hardware guide he has been named one of the world's top young innovators by mit technology review and has been recognized with several other awards including rice university's outstanding young engineering alumni award dr ranganathan received his b tech degree from the indian institute of technology madras and his ms and ph d from rice university houston contact information partha ranganathan hp labs email partha dot ranganathan at hp dot com
