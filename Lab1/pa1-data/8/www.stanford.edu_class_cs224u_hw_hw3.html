homework 3 homework 3 question 1 the following is a very small invented word document matrix words a b c d documents d1 d5 d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 a 10 15 0 9 10 b 5 8 1 2 5 c 14 11 0 10 9 d 13 14 10 11 12 a csv version of the matrix for use with spreadsheet and matrix programs your tasks 2.5 points for each word a b c and d calculate and provide its euclidean distance from word a and then use those values to rank all of the words with respect to their closeness to a closest 1 farthest 4 for each word you should provide its distance and rank 2.5 points normalize each row of the matrix by length definition below recalculate the euclidean distances of all the words from word a and recalculate the ranking with respect to a for each word you should provide its distance and rank you needn t provide the length normalized matrix 2 points if the ranking changed between step 1 and step 2 provide a brief explanation for the nature of that change and try to articulate why it changed if the ranking did not change provide a brief explanation for why normalization did not have an effect here euclidean distance the euclidean distance between vectors x and y of dimension n is sqrt sum_ i 1 n x_ i y_ i 2 length l2 normalization given a vector x of dimension n the normalization of x is a vector hat x also of dimension n obtained by dividing each element of x by sqrt sum_ i 1 n x_ i 2 question 2 3 points here is another invented word document matrix words a b c documents d1 d2 d3 d1 d2 d3 a 1 0 0 b 1000 1000 4000 c 1000 2000 999 calculate the pointwise mutual information pmi for cells a d1 and b d3 as defined in equation 4 of turney and pantel p 157 what is problematic about the values obtained how might we address the problem so that the pmi values are more intuitive
