problem statement providing 100 throughput for non uniform bernoulli traffic shang tse da chuang siva gaggara motivation maximum weight matching can provide 100 throughput with a speedup of 1 mckeown dai prabhakar any maximal matching algorithm can provide 100 throughput with a speedup of 2 dai prabhakar what speedup is required to provide 100 throughput using a practical maximal matching algorithm problem statement find  max non uniform bernoulli traffic with rate  ij  i  ij  max and  j  ij  max fpwwfa is the maximal matching algorithm s 1 wrapped wave front arbiter tamir reminder 3 1 1 2 2 friends strangers enemies 3 1 1 2 2  21  31  11  22  32  12  23  33  13 flows  11  21  32 and  33 are enemies flows  12  13 and  22 are strangers flow  23 is a friend the l traffic pattern 3 1 1 2 2  21  31  11 0  32 0 0  33 0 thus for this traffic pattern  max 0.75  21 1  11 q 31 service rate throughput formula 3 1 1 2 2  21  31  11 0  32 0  23  33 0 q 31 service rate  21 1  11 1  23  33 1  23 1  32 greater than l traffic analysis for all  23 simulation  11 0.2  21 0.3  32 0.15  33 0.35 conclusions  max 0.75 for l traffic pattern found throughput formula that matches simulation for any non uniform bernoulli traffic pattern for a 3x3 switch we believe that  max 0.75 is true for any non uniform bernoulli traffic pattern for any switch size
