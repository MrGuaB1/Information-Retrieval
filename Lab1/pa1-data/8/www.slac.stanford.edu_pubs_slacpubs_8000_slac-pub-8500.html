slac pub 8500 overmoded rectangular waveguide components for a multi moded rf power distribution system slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8500 overmoded rectangular waveguide components for a multi moded rf power distribution system abstract we describe the design of several novel passive waveguide devices being developed for the high power rf distribution system of the next linear collider 1 this system allows the combined power of several klystrons to be directed by means of drive phase manipulation to different accelerator feeds at different times during each pulse the desire to reduce the amount of required low loss circular waveguide delay line has led to the present multi moded scheme in which different modes travel through the same waveguide to different destinations components are needed for combining launching splitting and directing hundreds of megawatts at x band for simplicity manipulations are done primarily in overmoded rectangular guide with the height increased to improve power handling capacity features that invite breakdown such as coupling slots and h plane septa are avoided the components described here utilize te 10 and te 20 as operating modes they include a four input superhybrid a mode selective extractor mode preserving bends a rectangular mode converter and a rectangular to circular taper 2 which converts between the above modes and the circular te 11 and te 01 modes respectively full text pdf slac pub 8500 63.3 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8500 1.38 mb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
