gamma ray astrophysics depends in many ways on multiwavelength studies the gamma ray large area space telescope glast large area telescope lat collaboration has started multiwavelength planning well before the scheduled 2007 launch of the observatory some of the high priority multiwavelength needs include 1 availability of contemporaneous radio and x ray timing of pulsars 2 expansion of blazar catalogs including redshift measurements 3 improved observations of molecular clouds especially at high galactic latitudes 4 simultaneous broad band blazar monitoring 5 characterization of gamma ray transients including gamma ray bursts 6 radio optical x ray and tev counterpart searches for reliable and effective sources identification and characterization several of these activities are needed to be in place before launch
