calendar and readings week of march 28 page 1 eric roberts handout 3 cs 181 march 28 2011 calendar and readings week of march 28 monday march 28 the reading for today is the keynote address that my stanford colleague terry winograd delivered at the national conference on computing and values in 1991 ordinarily you should complete the readings before the class in question but doing so is clearly impossible for the first class tuesday march 29 since the course began almost twenty years ago we have started cs 181 by showing a wonderful film that highlights the ethical issues facing scientists in a historical context the film which has always been one of the most highly rated activities for this course is the 1981 documentary the day after trinity directed by jon else who used to teach in stanford's documentary film program before becoming chair of a similar program at berkeley the day after trinity charts the history of the atomic bomb project in world war ii focusing on the life of j robert oppenheimer scientific director of the manhattan project in los alamos both before and after the war we ll show the day after trinity tomorrow night at 7 30p m in hewlett 201 if you can t see the film at that time please find a time to watch it in the green media center thought questions for the film before he started to make the day after trinity jon else was convinced that he would never have worked on the manhattan project after interviewing the scientists shown in the film else realized that had he been a physics graduate student in the 1940s he would have been off to los alamos with the others how do you feel you would react in that historical situation in what situations can you imagine you might be faced with similar choices in the future in the day after trinity frank oppenheimer robert's younger brother and the founder of the san francisco exploratorium observes that it's amazing how the technology tools trap one while he was talking about the physics involved in building the atomic bomb the phrase sounds even more appropriate to computing to what extent if any have you experienced this feeling of being trapped by technology and tools wednesday march 30 i ll start wednesday's class with a general discussion of the day after trinity and the issues that it raises for scientists today i will then extend the themes raised by the film to more current questions involving similar issues updating the context from the manhattan page 2 2 project of the 1940s to the strategic defense initiative sdi of the 1980s which has now been recast as the national missile defense nmd program readings part 2 of the reader thought question the technical reasons that parnas cites for the infeasibility of the sdi were originally composed as part of his resignation letter to the strategic defense initiative organization but were later published in american scientist page 40 for the most part his argument consists of identifying a set of speculative technologies software engineering artificial intelligence automatic programming and program verification and then detailing why these approaches are not sufficient to solve the software problems of the sdi why do you think that parnas used this approach sections on thursday and friday section assignments will be mailed to you by wednesday at midnight your task before section is to write a reaction paper in which you respond to the following query the readings along with the day after trinity film offer several examples of how scientists face ethical decisions in their lives after it became clear that the german atomic bomb effort had failed joseph rotblat resigned from the manhattan project and returned to england where he discontinued his earlier work in atomic physics as you see in his letter to james offut page 38 david parnas also uses resignation to dramatize his concerns over the strategies being considered for ballistic missile defense leo szilard and his co signers page 24 wrote a petition outlining their concerns but continued to work on the project these strategies represent two possible responses to an ethical dilemma resignation is the more dramatic course but makes it more difficult to push for change on the inside looking at the situation that parnas faced for example what do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of each course of action how do you think you would have responded in his position you should send your reaction paper which should be no more than one or two pages in length to your section leader by noon on thursday
