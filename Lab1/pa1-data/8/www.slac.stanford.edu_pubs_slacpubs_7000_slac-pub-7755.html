slac pub 7755 phase stabilized and pulse shaped ti sapphire oscillator amplifier laser system for the lcls rf photoinjector slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7755 phase stabilized and pulse shaped ti sapphire oscillator amplifier laser system for the lcls rf photoinjector abstract we have designed a laser system for the linac coherent light source rf photoinjector consisting of a ti sapphire oscillator and 2 amplifiers using chirped pulse amplification the output after tripling will be 0.5 mj tunable uv pulses at 120 hz with wavelength around 260 nm pulsewidth of 10 ps fwhm and 200 fs rise and fall times amplitude stability is expected to be 1 rms in the uv and timing jitter better than 500 fs rms full text pdf slac pub 7755 54.9 kb compressed postscript slac pub 7755 90.8 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
