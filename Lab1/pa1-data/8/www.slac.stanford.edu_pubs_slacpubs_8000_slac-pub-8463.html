slac pub 8463 advanced collimator prototype results for the nlc slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8463 advanced collimator prototype results for the nlc abstract the next linear collider accelerator will include a large kilometer scale and complex collimation system the size and complexity of this system could be reduced if the collimator jaws could be made immune to damage from the electron beam we describe two collimation systems currently under development construction of a prototype system which uses wheels that can be moved to a new position after damage is underway the second system currently in the r d phase uses rotors which are continuously reformed from a bath of liquid metal as the collimation surface this second system allows operation at beam intensities which damage the jaws on every pulse we describe results of tests on both systems full text pdf slac pub 8463 218 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8463 171 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
