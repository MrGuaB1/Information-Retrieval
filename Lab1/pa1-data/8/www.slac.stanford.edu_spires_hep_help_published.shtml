published vs unpublished spires image hep hepnames institutions conferences experiments jobs videos published papers what is published as of april 2004 we began rectifying an inconsistency in counting some conference proceedings papers ie those in nucl phys proc suppl econf aps conf proc and a few others that were being counted as published for the purposes of the citation summary we no longer list conference proceedings as published where possible these papers are still counted in the first column but do not show up in the published column in the citesummary format this decision was made on the basis of common usage in the community of published as synonymous with peer reviewed unfortunately many conference proceedings are published in supplement issues of regular peer reviewed journals at the moment it is too difficult to distinguish these proceedings articles from regular journals we could of course exclude from published all papers that appear to have been given at a conference but since some of these are eventually published in peer reviewed litereature this seems wrong we would prefer to identify the volumes that contain conference supplements and exclude them individually however this is not an easy task both to identify the volumes and to allow our system to take this into account let us know if you have a suggestion regarding our procedure here but for the moment these supplement proceedings articles appear as published finally of course there are a few conferences that have standards that are higher than those of some journals we recognize this but make no attempt to judge or rate these conferences as peer reviewed in summary if your conference paper appeared in a serial publication entirely devoted to conferences it will not be counted as published if it appeared in a special issue of a regular journal it is currently counted as published until we can work out a better system for identifying these note that you can search for published papers using tc p or type code published or the older method of scl or ps p or s the first method is better for newer papers the latter method is faster for most papers but is harder to remember feel free to suggest things at spires slac stanford edu hep quick searches corrections additions abstracts email us spires topcites recent topcites hep reviews symmetry breaking playground biblio tools spires tools preprint listing resources arxiv hepdata pdg slac books about spires slac slac library contact spires hep is a joint project of slac desy & fnal as well as the worldwide hep community mirrors desy germany fermilab us ihep russia durham u uk slac us yitp japan lipi indonesia last updated 03 02 2012 valid xhtml 1.0 valid css
