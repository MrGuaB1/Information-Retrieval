poster proposal for neutrino 2008 title future constraints on and from lepton universality author tatsu takeuchi virginia te page 1 poster proposal for neutrino 2008 title future constraints on and from lepton universality author tatsu takeuchi virginia tech abstract the experimental constraints on lepton universality in charged current interactions are expected to improve dramatically in the near future due to new data from experiments such as pienu babar belle and the tevatron run 2 those constraints in turn will constrain various models of new physics involving neutrinos the list includes susy models with r parity violation leptoquark models and models with flavor distinguishing z's i will discuss how strong we can expect these constraints on from lepton universality to be
