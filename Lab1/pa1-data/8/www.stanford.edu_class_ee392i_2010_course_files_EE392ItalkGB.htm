ee 392 i seminar on trends in computing and communications department of electrical engineering spring 2009 2010 tue 4 15 pm 5 05 pm 60 120 main quad field programming technology for mainstream processing gordon brebner xilinx inc april 27 th 2010 abstract traditionally field programmable technologies notably fpgas have been predominantly used for implementing glue logic in systems or for prototyping designs destined for asic implementation nowadays however with the rapidly increasing capabilities of fpga devices approaching 1m programmable logic gates and rising asic development costs it is compelling to consider these technologies for implementing the heart of communication and computing systems this gives the benefits of hardware performance but with programmability both at design time and at run time one challenge though is to provide a software like look and feel to the user instead of the typical hardware style design experience the talk will be illustrated by examples from recent research on network packet processing speaker bio dr gordon brebner is a distinguished engineer at xilinx inc the worldwide leader in programmable logic solutions he works in xilinx labs in san jose california usa leading an international group researching issues surrounding networked processing systems of the future prior to joining xilinx in 2002 dr brebner was the professor of computer systems at the university of edinburgh in the united kingdom directing the institute for computing systems architecture he continues to be an honorary professor there
