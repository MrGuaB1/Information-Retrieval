charge home charge 1995 2003 charge the report of the international linear collider technical review committee was the first attempt to gather in one document the current status of all major positron electron linear collider projects in the world the report was the result of a collaborative effort of scientists from many laboratories working together during that year original charge a first and preliminary organizational meeting of the interlaboratory collaboration was held on october 18 1993 during lc93 at slac at that time desy kek and slac presented drafts of proposals for memoranda of understanding and various discussions took place on how this international collaboration might be orchestrated the first official meeting of the collaboration council was held in june 1994 at epac 94 in london the council as one of its first missions decided to create a technical review committee and asked its members to prepare a report in accordance with the following charge the technical review committee is to consider the goal to design build and operate a tev scale linear electron positron collider capable of satisfying the need to explore the particle physics of this energy range specifically the committee is to examine accelerator designs and technologies suitable for a collider that will initially have center of mass energy of 500 gev and luminosity in excess of and be built so that it can be expanded in energy and luminosity to reach 1 tev center of mass energy with luminosity of the committee should consider construction and operation of both the initial facility and the upgrade path to 1 tev the committee is also asked to comment on the potential of technologies to reach higher energies and luminosities and to provide alternative physics capabilities for example gamma gamma collisions the technical review committee is to identify the accelerator physics and technological requirements for each approach to provide particle physics opportunities at the energy and luminosity goals stated above the report of the committee should contain a brief commentary of the status of and expected progress toward understanding and achieving the most important of these requirements the committee should attempt to identify areas of possible further collaboration in the world wide linear collider r&d program a draft of the committee report should be submitted to the collaboration council shortly after the lc95 meeting scheduled for march 1995 in japan as a result of deliberations at the icfa meeting of february 8 and 9 2001 at desy professor h sugawara as chairman of icfa requested that the international linear collider technical review committee ilc trc reconvene its activities to produce a second report second charge to assess the present technical status of the four lc designs at hand and their potentials for meeting the advertised parameters at 500 gev cm use common criteria definitions computer codes etc for the assessments to establish for design the r&d work that remains to be done in the next few years to prepare a conceptual design report from which final costs can be calculated and construction can proceed to assess the potential of each design for reaching higher energies above 500 gev cm and the r&d work needed to reach this potential to suggest future areas of collaboration general questions or comments g loew or l white questions about the page reitmeyer
