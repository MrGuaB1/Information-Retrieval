xilinx coregen elements in modelsim xilinx coregen elements in modelsim if you have any questions email jcoburn stanford edu the xilinx ise toolset allows you to add logic blocks created with the core generator these logic blocks can be instantiated in your design however they are not readily available to simulate in modelsim to simulate elements such as brams or multipliers follow the steps below to create a coregen wrapper file and compile the coregen libraries to run on modelsim in order to simulate coregen elements in modelsim modelsim must be made aware of the xilinx coregen simulation models xilinx solution record 15338 provides instructions to do this for us make sure to use the modelsim se instructions this needs to be done once for each modelsim install all you really need to do is type compxlib s mti_se f all l all oc modeltech_5 7a xilinx_libs at a command prompt creating a coregen wrapper file implement a multiplier in coregen for this example i made a parallel multiplier with two 8 bit signed inputs non registered and a single 16 bit registered output i also chose minimum pipelining so the output latency is only one cycle simulation method line 22 loads the coregen library file that was created above line 23 compiles the three verilog source files note that paul_bram v was generated by coregen line 24 loads the modules into the simulator line 25 runs the modules the testbench file includes the line timescale 1ns 10ps that ensures all the simulation delay times are correlated we are not using that feature and its only there to keep down some warnings in modelsim the source files used for this example are here if you have any questions email jcoburn stanford edu
