safety data sheet nuclide rb 86 page 1 radionuclide safety data sheet nuclide rb 86 forms soluble except gaseous physical characteristics half life 18.66 days type decay beta beta maximum energy 0.6978 mev 8.76 1.7744 mev 91.24 gammas 1.0766 mev 8.81 hazard category c level low hazard 0.01 to 1 mci b level moderate hazard 1 mci to 100 mci a level high hazard greater than 100 mci external radiation hazards and shielding the gamma exposure rate at 1 cm from 1 mci of rb86 shielded for betas is 500 mr hr and at 1 foot will be 0.5 mr hr the half and tenth values of lead for this gamma are 1.4 and 4.6 cm respectively this means that lead bricks should be available for shielding stock material the beta particles are a significant external hazard when the vial is being handled outside of shielding such as for dilutions etc the dose rate from betas is 310000 mrads hr at 1 cm per mci the maximum range of the betas is about 0.25 0.3 inches in lucite the use of the lead shield for storage will provide an adequate shield for the beta particles hazards if internally deposited rb 86 distributes in the total body similarly to potassium it has a biological half life of 45 days and an effective half life of 13.2 days the maximum permissible body burden mpbb is 3.0 uci based on stanford guideline of whole body dose not exceeding 500 mrem yr the annual limit of intake alli is 45 uci dosimetry and bioassay requirements film badges and dosimeter rings are required if 5 millicuries or more are being handled at any one time or millicurie levels are handled on a frequent daily basis urine assays may be required after spills or contamination incidents special problems and precautions 1 work behind shielding preferably transparent materials survey frequently change gloves often 2 segregate wastes to those with half lives between 4 to 19 days 3 limit of soluble waste to sewer 10 microcuries per day per lab 10 87 page 2
