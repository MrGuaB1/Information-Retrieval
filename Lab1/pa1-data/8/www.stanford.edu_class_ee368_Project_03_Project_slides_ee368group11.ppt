face detection using maximal rejection classification and color techniques face detection using maximal rejection classification and color techniques group 11 sam mazin & priti balchandani motivation michael elad's presentation on rejection based techniques felt a linear classifier mrc would be fastest and thus most practical in real world applications high level design maximal rejection classifier mrc color rejection morphological processing faces maximal rejection training background faces  d1 d2 convex backgrounds maximal rejection classifying  n d1 n d2 n 15x15 test block mrc projection background last  face not last  project with  n 1 very fast color rejection mrc was not the greatest on its own many false positives remained tried rgb segmentation not great y cb cr space showed promise decided to take mean cb and cr values of all 15x15 blocks ignored y to avoid intensity bias color rejection using fld optimal cb cr fld projection w faces backgrounds w max fld_proj faces projection density p w morphological processing maximal rejection classifier mrc color rejection morphological processing faces morphological processing combined 3 resolution levels into one dilated and performed centroid search to get rid of repeated face detections finally desperate times monday night 10pm still had 5 6 false positives popping up decided to implement the look down method reran tests made good scores better but bad scores worse conclusion mrc is fast but not 100 reliable probably due to lack of data color rejection helped significantly cb cr good means of classification morphological processing necessary for repeated detections spent too much time tweaking the mrc
