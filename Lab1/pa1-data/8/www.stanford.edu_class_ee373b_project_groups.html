project groups adaptive noise cancellation in a weather forecast system student vincent gire pi vincent gire synopsis the aim of the project is to reduce noise in fsk demodulation it will involve 1 modelling the transmission channel to take into account potential multi paths existing between transmitter and receiver and 2 the reduction of periodic noise by adaptive noise cancellation cardiology defibrillator students nick dargahi michelle hewlett thomas john baharan kamousi pis bryant lin amin al ahmad synopsis channel equalization in underwater acoustic communications student leili baghaei rad pi leili baghaei rad synopsis cognitive memory control systems students sufen fong martin trautmann pi bernard widrow synopsis investigating how cognitive memory can be used for control problems to keep things simple the inverted pendulum is studied to enable comparison of control properties of cognitive memory to that of other control algorithms cognitive memory curiosity students dave kale pis bernard widrow sudeepto chakraborty synopsis emulating a baby curiosity exhibiting curiosity given certain inborn knowledge pre loaded into her cognitive memory as she moves randomly about a virtual landscape acquiring knowledge about her environment ct reconstruction students jongduk baek hoon cho hyukjoon kwon pi jongduk baek synopsis in ct reconstruction it is important to have uniform x ray source intensity however actual x ray source has intensity variation and this intensity is time varying intensity calibration is important because non uniform intensity can give rise to image artifacts the goal is to perform intensity calibration using lms algorithm decoding neural signals from premotor cortices students zuley rivera alvidrez pi zuley rivera alvidrez synopsis neural networks will be used to decode neural signals from monkeys premotor cortices neural network techniques will be applied to the signal processing of neural signals recorded from the brains of monkeys while they perform simple reach tasks dynamic prediction of tumor movements student paul j csonka pi lei xing synopsis using computer vision to continuously predict tumor location some number of frames into the future in order to more accurately radiate them eye tracking 1 students jonathan hsieh minggang guo jason min pi joyce liao synopsis building a model of eye movement following a dot on the screen creating analytical tools to show real time eye movement and automatically detecting abnormalities eye tracking 2 students sufeng li michael shimasaki pi joyce liao synopsis explore the response of eye movement in relation to a moving object viewed on a screen design an adaptive filter that models normal eye movement in reponse to a continuously moving object modelled as a first order markov process this will enable detection of abnormalities by comparison with the output of the adaptive filter lms adaptive digital background calibration of charge redistribution adcs student stephen o driscoll pi stephen o driscoll synopsis investigate whether or not lms adaptation is a useful calibration technique for charge redistribution analog to digital converters adcs lms adaptive calibration techniques have been used successfully in pipeline adcs as discussed in a number of publications from uc berkeley over the past 3 4 years non linear power amplifier distortion processing using lms student liquan tan pi liquan tan synopsis by using lms to implement automatic pre and or post distortion processing non linearity in the power amplifier can be addressed much more elegantly the difference between this and conventional pre post distortion treatment is that the lms algorithm may be implemented in analog circuits eliminating the need for an adc or digital processing block self reference wideband noise cancellation student kapil rai pi kapil rai synopsis wideband signal and additive interference will be decomposed into l subspace dimensions and cancellation performed adaptively in every dimension with a synthetic reference signal time permitting multiple antennae will be considered to obtain some advantage in the spatial domain up
