lat beam test beam test at cern fine tuning the lat constructed out of spare modules ie two trackers and three calorimeters a mini lat calibration unit cu will be used in the beam test scheduled at cern from the end of july through mid september 2006 these tests will help to better understand the behavior of different particles as they strike the detector at different angles results of these tests will be useful in validating monte carlo mc simulations used for ground tests of glast's large area telescope lat during its integration and test phases results will also be used to tune aspects of the reconstruction process beam testing will be conducted at low energies 50mev 15gev using the proton synchrotron ps beam and at high energies 10 300 gev using the super proton synchrotron sps ultimately these tests will help to better calibrate the large area telescope lat once it is launched into orbit primary objectives include characterizing performance at high energies ie corrections for leakage inter tower gaps backsplash etc verifying mc simulations of the detector's response in terms of electromagnetic showers gamma electron point spread function and energy reconstruction methods distributions of quantities related to those used in background rejection with hadron beams extracting information a slightly beefed up ie somewhat enhanced version of the glast event analysis machine gleam will be used to extract extra information about the beamline through the lat tests will also afford opportunities for online monitoring of code and testing the pipeline's ability to safely and reliably transfer large amounts of data at the speeds for which it was designed note this section of the workbook is in the very early stages of development at this time only navbar topics displayed in white have live links topics displayed in purple are strawman content categories only and can be expected to change as work progresses last updated by chuck patterson 05 02 2006
