face detection face detection group 1 gary chern paul gurney jared starman input image color based mask generation region finding and separation maximal rejection classifier mrc duplicate rejection and gender recognition our algorithm 4 step algorithm runs in 30 seconds for test image 3 d rgb color space noticeable overlap between face and non face pixels quantized rgb vectors from 0 63 not 0 255 probable face pixels lighter pixels mean higher probability of being a face pixel filter with oval structuring element removes background speckle color segmented mask mask produced from thresholding the filtered probability image still have connected regions erosion and dilation separates most faces but not all further processing is required head and neck templates to separate faces convolve regions with head and neck templates find locations with highest correlation remove region and repeat repeat with several sized head and neck templates mrc model review as discussed in class find projection of image set that minimizes of non faces selected gather lots of 's mrc w out color segmentation computationally more intensive training wasn t perfect so we still get non faces false detections usually aren t face colored in mrc potential faces input to mrc our idea just do mrc on color segmented separated regions notice bag of oranges and two roof pictures are the only non face inputs mrc only has to remove those 3 pictures output of mrc and it does duplicate rejection and gender if two detected faces are too close we throw out the second face we search for the lowest average valued darkest detected face and label that as female we found all faces but one obstructed in this test image also found 1 female results 1 obstructed face image faces detected faces in image percentage correct repeated faces and false positives bonus 1 20 21 95 0 1 2 23 24 96 0 1 3 25 25 100 0 0 4 23 24 96 0 0 5 21 24 88 0 0 6 23 24 96 0 0 7 22 22 100 0 0 results 2
