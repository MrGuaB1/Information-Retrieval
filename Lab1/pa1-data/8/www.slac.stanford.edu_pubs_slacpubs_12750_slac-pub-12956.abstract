we report the results of the first high power tests of single cell traveling wave and standing wave structures these tests are part of an experimental and theoretical study of rf breakdown in normal conducting structures at 11.4 ghz 1 the goal of this study is to determine the gradient potential of normal conducting rf powered particle beam accelerators the test setup consists of reusable mode converters and short test structures and is powered by slac's xl 4 klystron this setup was created for economical testing of different cell geometries cell materials and preparation techniques with short turn around time the mode launchers and structures were manufactured at slac and kek and tested in the slac klystron test lab
