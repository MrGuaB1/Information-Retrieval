slac pub 8042 luminosity upgrades for the slc slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8042 luminosity upgrades for the slc abstract recent performance improvements at the slac linear collider slc have led to a proposal to further increase the luminosity up to a factor of four through a series of modest hardware upgrades new final focus optics introduced in 1997 combined with permanent magnet octupoles have reduced the contribution to the final beam size due to higher order aberrations the minimum betas achievable at the ip are presently limited by the increase in detector backgrounds as the beam is focused more strongly by moving the final quadrupoles closer to the interaction point ip one can reduce the synchrotron radiation background while decreasing the ip betas other upgrades include increasing the bending radius in the final focus to minimize emittance dilutions due to synchrotron radiation a fast feedforward from the linac to the final focus to cancel trajectory jitter and a change in the horizontal damping ring partition number to reduce the emittance of the extracted beam with these upgrades the expected disruption enhancement should be 2.4 full text pdf slac pub 8042 105 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8042 263 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 05 pdt by htmlme pl
