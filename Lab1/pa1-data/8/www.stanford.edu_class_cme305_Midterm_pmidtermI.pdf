cme305 sample midterm i page 1 cme305 sample midterm i 1 matchings and independent sets assume that you are given graph g v e a matching m in g and inde pendent s in g show that m s v 2 unique minimum st cut given a network g v e s t give a polynomial time algorithm to deter mine whether g has a unique minimum st cut 3 chinese postman problem imagine that you are a postman you park your truck in your district and you want to walk around delivering mail to every street in the district and then return to your truck also you are efficient so you want to minimize the total number of streets that you have to visit this can be formulated as a graph problem given a connected graph g v e find a closed walk of minimum length that traverses every edge at least once a give a polynomial time algorithm that gives a closed walk of length at most 2 e b harder give a polynomial time algorithm that gives a closed walk of length at most e v 1 1
