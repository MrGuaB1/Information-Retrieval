iib fall 2000 paper no 2 e aprile et al spectroscopy and imaging performance of the liquid xenon gamma ray imaging telescope lxegrit full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract lxegrit is a balloon borne compton telescope based on a liquid xenon time projection chamber lxetpc for imaging cosmic gamma rays in the energy band of 0.2 20 mev the detector with 400 cm 2 area and 7 cm drift gap is filled with high purity lxe both ionization and scintillation light signals are detected to measure the energy deposits and the three spatial coordinates of individual gamma ray interactions within the sensitive volume the tpc has been characterized with repeated measurements of its spectral and compton imaging response to gamma rays from radioactive sources such as na cs y and am be the detector shows a linear response to gamma rays in the energy range 511 kev 4.4 mev with an energy resolution fwhm of delta e e 8.8 sqrt 1mev e compton imaging of y gamma ray events with two detected interactions is consistent with an angular resolution of 3 degrees rms at 1.8 mev last modified 19 dec 2000 jochen
