poster template page 1 with complete information without scale information image reconstruction based on local feature descriptors maryam daneshi jiaqi guo department of electrical engineering stanford university motivation image reconstruction pipeline related work scale learning local descriptors of image ldfr local feature descriptor based reconstruction cuo colorization using optimization information about images is often stored as local feature descriptors sift surf etc is it possible to reconstruct images simply based on these feature descriptors we wish to explore the feasibility of reconstructing images especially without scale information image reconstruction using affine patches and poisson image editing p perez et al colorization method y weiss et al with complete information without scale information sift surf find the patch in the db that match the descriptors most closely scale information scale learning no yes blend the patches poisson image editing image completion by interpolation original image first patch dominant scale repeat till all scales are found yes no assign found scale assign dominant scale create a color mask manually find the colors of the other pixels by minimizing x pixel position w weight function database of patches more results reconstructed image original image known scale scale with min mse scale mse threshold closest patch with unknown scale
