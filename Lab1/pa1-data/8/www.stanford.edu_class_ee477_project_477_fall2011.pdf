477 final project page 1 477 final project this year's project theme is genomics you will choose one among four possible problems to be elaborated in class of genomic data compression and processing criteria for project assessment 1 experimental how well does your scheme do on real data how does it perform compared to current practice 2 algorithmic complexity how simple is the implementation running time required memory size etc elegance is your scheme graceful hard to define formally you know it when you see it ziv lempel schemes are an example 3 analysis modeling how are you modeling if you are the data how realistic is this model what features of the problem is it incorporating what features is it neglecting analysis what kind of performance can you guarantee how close is it to optimum universality how universal is your scheme can it be guaranteed to be making sense performing well close to optimally regardless of the model or for a whole family of models or perhaps in some appropriate individual sequence sense grading if you score highly under either the first or the third criterion i would consider that to be a really good project any two of the three criteria i would consider that a great project all three criteria i would consider that to be an amazing project 1
