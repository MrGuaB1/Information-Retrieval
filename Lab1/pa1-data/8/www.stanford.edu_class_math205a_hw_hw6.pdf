math 205a homework 6 fall 2010 1 suppose that x a  is a finite measure space and that f x r is an a measurable fun page 1 math 205a homework 6 fall 2010 1 suppose that x a  is a finite measure space and that f x r is an a measurable function prove that f limp fp here f is the infimum of the essential upper bounds for f an essential upper bound for a function g x is a number c such that  x g x c 0 the book gives a more complicated definition for f the more complicated definition is better for weird measure spaces but for any reasonable measure space the two definitions are equivalent in particular the definitions are equivalent unless the space has a set of infinite measure that contains no subset of finite nonzero measure 2 let f lp r where 1 p prove that for every  there is a continuous compactly supported function g r r such that f gp  the support of g is the closure of the set of points where g 0 we say that g is compactly supported if the support of g is compact 3 suppose f lp r where 1 p let fh be the function given by fh x f x h a prove that lim h 0 fh fp 0 b suppose g lq r where 1 p 1 q 1 define  r r by  x t r f x t g t dt prove that  is bounded and uniformly continuous 1
