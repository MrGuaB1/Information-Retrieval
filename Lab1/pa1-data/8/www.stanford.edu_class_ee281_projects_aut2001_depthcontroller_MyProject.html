ee281 project ee281 project ioan tudosa stanford university fall 2001 depth control in water using pid introduction design hardware software results improvements initial idea the project idea developed gradually in my mind first i read the chapter about pid control in stuart ball's book analog interfacing to embedded microprocessors then i ve always wanted to make something that controls a motor and since i like water a depth control device sprung up as a reasonable project later i came across this web site with submarine rc models and i quickly decided on implementing my depth control project on a little submarine objectives the main task is to control the depth of a floating object statically ie the object doesn t move through water to reach a depth hydro dynamically like a plane for this purpose i try to adjust the floatability of the object by changing its volume a pid control is used to have less overshoot when changing positions and a rf remote control transmits the user setpoint also the user can fine tune the pid parameters without having to take the object out of water as you see i have designed it as a prototype to the little submarine i want to build here are the links i gathered in my favorites during searches on web for the project for the moment they are unsorted but maybe you ll find something interesting project picture
