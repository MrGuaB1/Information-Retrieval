neutrino mass low scale leptogenesis and dark matter candidates in an extended seesaw model page 1 neutrino mass low scale leptogenesis and dark matter candidates in an extended seesaw model sin kyu kang school of liberal arts seoul national university of technology seoul 139 743 korea e mail skkang snut ac kr abstract we consider an extended seesaw model by introducing extra singlet neutrinos and singlet scalar boson and show how low scale leptogenesis is successfully realized in this scenario it is examined if the newly introduced neutral particles either singlet majorana neutrino or singlet scalar boson can be a candidate for dark matter we study the implications of the dark matter detection through the scattering off the nucleus of the detecting material on our scenarios for dark matter in addition we discuss the implications for the search of invisible higgs decay at lhc which may serve as a probe of our scenario for dark matter
