lab 3 aircraft supplement page 1 lab 3 bifilar pendulum supplement applications to aircraft having an accurate inertial matrix of an aircraft is imperative for an accurate control system because the inertial matrix is often hard coded into the software of an aircraft but how do we find the values for this matrix to find the moments of inertia we can use our knowledge of geometry to calculate it for instance we can do this for a simple rectangle for more complicated geometries the triple integral that must be solved does not simplify to clean equations if we build a model in solidworks and assign density we can have cad software numerically compute this integral here is what solidworks gives us when we go to tools mass properties mass 0.11 pounds center of mass inches x 0.53 y 0.75 z 0.65 moments of inertia pounds square inches taken at the center of mass and aligned with the output coordinate system lxx 0.56 lxy 0.00 lxz 0.00 lyx 0.00 lyy 0.88 lyz 0.03 lzx 0.00 lzy 0.03 lzz 0.35 page 2 perform the bifilar pendulum test to compare real world iyy with solidworks's analysis in reality we are swinging this plane about 1 cm forward of its center of mass find the iyy about its center of mass using the parallel axis theorem iyy is this close to the solidworks example what might be causing these differences
