mips lite instruction set summary mips light instruction set summary the mips light isa is a stripped down version of the mips r2000 isa which is very close to the dlx isa that is described in the textbook the main difference between mips light isa and dlx isa concerns the branch instructions mips light allows branches that have equal and not equal comparisons between any two registers when one of the registers is r0 the branch instruction is equivalent to a beqz or a bnez instruction in dlx please ignore references to the instructions bltzal and bgezal which are not implemented in the mips lite verilog model 5.0 1 instruction formats in addition to the standard r2000 formats shown above the mips lite instruction set also has an additional format for the bltz and bgez instructions bit 31 26 25 21 20 16 15 0 field op regimm rs sub offset 5.0 2 load and store instructions 5.0 3 alu instructions 5.0 4 jump and branch instructions errata the correct jalr instruction format is jalr rd rs
