slac pub 8199 direct measurement of ac using inclusive charm tagging at the sld detector slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8199 direct measurement of a c using inclusive charm tagging at the sld detector abstract we report a new measurement of a c using data obtained by sld in 1993 98 this measurement uses a vertex tag technique where the selection of a c hemisphere is based on the reconstructed mass of the charm hadron decay vertex the method uses the 3d vertexing capabilities of sld's ccd vertex detector and the small and stable slc beams to obtain a high c event tagging effciency and purity of 28 and 82 respectively charged kaons identified by the crid detector and the charge of the reconstructed vertex provide an efficient quark antiquark tag with the analyzing power calibrated from the data we obtain a preliminary result of a c 0.603 0.028 0.023 full text pdf slac pub 8199 282 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8199 124 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
