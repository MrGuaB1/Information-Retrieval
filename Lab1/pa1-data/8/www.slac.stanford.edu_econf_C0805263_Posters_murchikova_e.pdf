references oscillations page 1 references when neutrino moves through dense matter and electromagnetic field it can behave as free particles ie move with the constant group velocity and conserve the polarization oscillations spin of the particle oscillates with respect to the proper time but the neutrino moves with definite group velocity it's left handed and right handed components have the same velocity move together and does not shift one with respect to another so we got exactly pure neutrino states with spin oscillating properties
