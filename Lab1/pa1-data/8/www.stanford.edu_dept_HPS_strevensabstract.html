strevens abstract the prehistoric roots of maxwell's discovery of the velocity distribution by michael strevens philosophy department stanford university abstract in 1860 james clerk maxwell published a formula giving the distribution of the velocity of the molecules in an ideal gas maxwell's formula was correct and provided the foundation for the development of kinetic theory and ultimately statistical mechanics in the late nineteenth century but the reasoning behind maxwell's derivation of the distribution is rather obscure i will argue that maxwell was using a sophisticated method for inferring the values of probabilities that was not discovered by him or any of his eminent predecessors but which is rather an inheritance from the distant past the method dates back perhaps to prehistoric times where it had as it has today more practical uses
