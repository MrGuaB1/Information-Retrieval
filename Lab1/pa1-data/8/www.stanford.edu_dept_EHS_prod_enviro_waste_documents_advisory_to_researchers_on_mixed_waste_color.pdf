advisory to researchers on mixed waste color page 1 environmental health & safety 480 oak rd stanford ca 94305 8007 650 723 0448 http ehs stanford edu identifying mixed chemical and radioactive waste mixed waste is any waste material containing both radioactive materials and hazardous chemicals many buffers contain hazardous materials and many processes using hazardous chemicals as wash solutions may result in a mixed waste examples of commonly used hazardous materials that may result in a mixed waste alcohols ethanol methanol isopropanol tri fluoro acetic acid tfa acetic acid sodium hydroxide chloroform formamide some trademarked reagents and kits may contain hazardous materials always review the msds to determine if any proprietary material you are using contains hazardous materials the first step is to determine if the hazardous materials are present in sufficient concentration to make your waste a regulated mixed waste dilute concentrations of hazardous materials may not meet the regulatory definition please review the list of non hazardous materials found at http nonhazardouswaste stanford edu if your waste contains only non hazardous wastes as noted on the list you do not have a mixed waste and it may be managed as a normal radioactive waste researchers must obtain permission from the radiation safety committee to generate mixed waste contact your health physicist or 723 3201 if you waste contains materials not listed on the nonhazardous waste list calculations or testing may be necessary to determine if your waste is regulated for assistance with a waste determination contact eh&s at 725 7529 or send an email to cbarney stanford edu eh&s has developed instructions for management of mixed waste which is available through eh&s and on the web at http mixedwaste stanford edu page 2 environmental health & safety 480 oak rd stanford ca 94305 8007 650 723 0448 http ehs stanford edu mixed waste management procedures 1 waste containing p32 12 life of 15 days store the mixed waste in your lab for ten 12 lives 150 days during storage affix a stanford hazardous waste tag o you can create a tag using our on line system found at http wastetag stanford edu also label the waste with isotope and activity if you add additional radioactive waste after initially dating the container the hold for decay time is extended but you cannot change the date on the chemical waste tag once ten 12 lives have elapsed for all wastes in the container submit a pickup request to eh&s you must submit a pickup request when the container is no more than 8 months old and you must hold the waste for ten 12 lives for this reason you should not add additional wastes to the container after 100 days have passed since the original waste was added o to submit a pickup request go to http wastepickup stanford edu o please note in the comments section of the request that your waste previously contained radio isotopes 2 if you must use long lived isotopes such as i125 s35 c14 and h3 determine if the hazardous chemical portion can be treated to make it non hazardous common treatment methods are neutralization and solidification in cement in order to conduct this treatment you must obtain additional training from eh&s and keep records please contact the environmental protection program at 725 7529 3 if long lived mixed waste cannot be treated you must manage your waste in accordance with both the chemical waste and the radiation safety requirements including labeling as noted above due to difficulty of securing disposal options for these wastes you must submit a pickup request to the chemical waste program within 6 months of generation again do not add radioactive waste to the container more than 100 days after the initial waste was generated
