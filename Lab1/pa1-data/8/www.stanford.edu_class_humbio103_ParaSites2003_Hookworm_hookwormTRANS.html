untitled document transmission n americanus larvae must penetrate the skin directly while a duodenale infections can be percutaneous oral transmammary and probably placental life cycle eggs are passed in the stool 1 and under favorable conditions moisture warmth shade larvae hatch in 1 to 2 days the released rhabditiform larvae grow in the feces and or the soil 2 and after 5 to 10 days and two molts they become become filariform third stage larvae that are infective 3 these infective larvae can survive 3 to 4 weeks in favorable environmental conditions on contact with the human host the larvae penetrate the skin and are carried through the veins to the heart and then to the lungs they penetrate into the pulmonary alveoli ascend the bronchial tree to the pharynx and are swallowed 4 the larvae reach the small intestine where they reside and mature into adults adult worms live in the lumen of the small intestine where they attach to the intestinal wall with resultant blood loss by the host 5 most adult worms are eliminated in 1 to 2 years but longevity records can reach several years some a duodenale larvae following penetration of the host skin can become dormant in the intestine or muscle in addition infection by a duodenale may probably also occur by the oral and transmammary route n americanus however requires a transpulmonary migration phase source http www dpd cdc gov dpdx html imagelibrary hookworm_il htm reservoir there is no known reservoir although laboratory tests have shown that certain animals rabbits lambs calves and pigs can act as paratenic hosts when fed infective larvae of a duodenale and are then infective when fed to puppies markell 285 animal hookworms a braziliense uncinaria stenocephala may penetrate human skin causing cutaneous larva migrans but then cease to develop alternatively the animal hookworm a ceylanicum may parasitize humans vector none larvae infect host directly
