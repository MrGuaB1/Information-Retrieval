slac pub 8584 beam based feedback simulations for the nlc linac slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8584 beam based feedback simulations for the nlc linac abstract extensive beam based feedback systems are planned as an integral part of the next linear collider nlc control system wakefield effects are a significant influence on the feedback design imposing both architectural and algorithmic constraints studies are in progress to assure the optimal selection of devices and to refine and confirm the algorithms for the system design we show the results of initial simulations along with evaluations of system response for various conditions of ground motion and other operational disturbances full text pdf slac pub 8584 93.7 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8584 70.8 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
