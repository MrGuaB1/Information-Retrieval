lat irfs effective area lat irfs effective area the lat effective area is a function of an incident photon's energy e and inclination angle  and the event class note that the effective area does not take into account the deadtime and therefore the observed count rate will be the effective area times the incident photon flux times the livetime fraction the following plots show the effective area for the source class note that 1 m 2 is 10 4 cm 2 on axis effective area effective area as a function of angle 10 gev photons owned by david band last updated by chuck patterson 05 01 2009 back to top
