a low temperature energy calibration system for the cuore bolometric double beta decay experiment karsten m heeger university page 1 a low temperature energy calibration system for the cuore bolometric double beta decay experiment karsten m heeger university of wisconsin the search for neutrinoless double beta decay is a unique mechanism to probe the majorana nature of neutrinos and measure the effective neutrino mass cuore the cryogenic underground observatory for rare events is a next generation experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in 130te using an array of 988 teo2 crystals at 10 mk with a total mass of 207kg cuore will search for an excess of events above background near the q value of 2530 kev and probe the effective neutrino mass with a sensitivity of a few tens of mev a precise measurement of the event energy with the bolometer array is crucial for the identification of candidate double beta decay events a novel low temperature calibration system with ultra low background is being developed to perform a precise calibration of the energy response of each one of the teo2 crystals in the cuore bolometer array we present the design expected performance and experimental challenges of this low temperature calibration system
