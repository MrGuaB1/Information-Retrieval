search for  bursts of different duration and origin with the lvd experiment at the gran sasso laboratory page 1 search for  bursts of different duration and origin with the lvd experiment at the gran sasso laboratory w fulgione for the lvd collaboration march 31 2008 the large volume detector lvd in the infn gran sasso national laboratory italy is a 1 kt liquid scintillator detector whose major purpose is monitoring the galaxy to study neutrino bursts from gravitational stellar collapses the experiment has been taking data under different configurations since 1992 reaching in 2001 its present and final configura tion the lvd performances from the point of view of the on line identification of a neutrino burst are presented in this study together with the results of the updated search for neutri nos from core collapse supernovae the possibility to observe weak neutrino signals expected from neutron stars collapsing into black holes on the basis of a model prediction which deals with bursts durations of few milliseconds is discussed the behavior of the detector background over a wide range of time windows from 1 ms to 200 s has been analyzed and the detector sensitivity to these kind of events is discussed 1
