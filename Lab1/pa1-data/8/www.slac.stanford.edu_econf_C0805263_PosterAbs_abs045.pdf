we explore the effect of non unitary neutrino mixing on neutrino oscillation probabilities both in vacuum and matter in particu page 1 we explore the effect of non unitary neutrino mixing on neutrino oscillation probabilities both in vacuum and matter in particular we consider the   channel and using a neutrino factory as the source for 's and discuss the constraints that can be obtained on the moduli and phases of the parameters characterizing the violation of unitarity we point out how the new cp violation phases present in the case of non unitary mixing give rise to spurious degenerate solutions in the parameter space and discuss how the true solutions can be extricated by combining measurements at several baselines 1
