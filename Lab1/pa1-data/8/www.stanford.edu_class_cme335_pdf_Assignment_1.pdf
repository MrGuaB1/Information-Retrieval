cme 335 assignment 1 page 1 jan 20 2012 due monday feb 6th cme 335 assignment 1 1 the slow slant stack transform the slow slant stack transform is a discrete radon transform which is computed by shearing and summing of a digital image over a uniformly sampled set of projection slopes the set of coefficients consists of 2 subsets one for the horizontal shearing and another for the vertical shearing a 15 derive a closed form expression for the slow slant stack coefficients b 5 implement the slow slant stack transform use the same line discretization method as the one in the fast slant stack transform ie slopes set of s 1 1 2 n 1 4 n 1 2 n for each type of shearing you can use the posted shear m function c 10 implement the adjoint slow slant stack transform verify that it is the valid adjoint 2 the pseudo polar fft and the fast slant stack a 15 implement the fast slant stack transform by application of the ppfft and usage of the projection slice theorem you can you the posted fractional fft function ffft m b 15 derive a closed form expression for the fast slant stack coefficients c 10 implement the adjoint for the fast slant stack algorithm verify that it is the valid adjoint d 10 implement an inverse solver for the fss transform using your choice of iterative method 3 20 compare the forward slow and fast slant stack transform and do the necessary adjustment in order for the transforms to produce the same set of coefficients for a given arbitrary image or at least as close as you can compare the running time of the 2 algorithm for image sizes of 16 32 64 128 256 and 512
