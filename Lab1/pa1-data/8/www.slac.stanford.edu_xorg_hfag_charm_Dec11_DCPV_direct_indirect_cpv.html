combination of direct and indirect cp violation combination of direct and indirect cp violation updated 28 december 2011 people working on this marco gersabeck notation this combination uses measurements of direct and indirect cp violation to extract the level of agreement for a no cp violation hypothesis the observables are a   d 0 k k  d 0 k k  d 0 k k  d 0 k k to constrain indirect cp violation via a  a cp ind and a cp a cp kk a cp  to constrain direct cp violation a cp dir via a cp a cp dir  t  a cp ind where  t is the difference of the average proper time of the kk and  modes a  2 fit is performed in the plane a cp dir vs a cp ind for cases where an experiment does not directly quote a value for a cp the difference of the quoted values for a cp kk and a cp  is calculated adding all uncertainties in quadrature this may overestimate the systematic uncertainty for the difference as it neglects correlated errors however the result is conservative and the effect is small as all measurements are statistically limited for all measurements statistical and systematic uncertainties are added in quadrature when calculating the  2 for world average values of mixing parameters click here for tables of measured cp asymmetries click here year experiment results  t  comment reference 2007 belle a  0.01 0.30 stat 0.15 syst 540 fb 1 near  4s resonance m staric et al belle collab phys rev lett 98 211803 2007 2008 babar a  0.26 0.36 stat 0.08 syst 384 fb 1 near  4s resonance b aubert et al babar collab phys rev d 78 011105 r 2008 2011 lhcb a  0.59 0.59 stat 0.21 syst 28 pb 1 s 7 tev pp collisions r aaij et al lhcb collab arxiv 1112.4698 submitted to jhep 2008 babar a cp kk 0.00 0.34 stat 0.13 syst a cp  0.24 0.52 stat 0.22 syst 0.00 385.8 fb 1 near  4s resonance b aubert et al babar collab phys rev lett 100 061803 2008 2008 belle a cp 0.86 0.60 stat 0.07 syst 0.00 540 fb 1 near  4s resonance m staric et al belle collab phys lett b 670 190 2008 2011 cdf a cp 0.46 0.31 stat 0.12 syst 0.26 5.9 fb 1 s 1.96 tev p p collisions t aaltonen et al cdf collab arxiv 1111.5023 submitted to prd 2011 lhcb a cp 0.82 0.21 stat 0.11 syst 0.10 0.62 fb 1 s 7 tev pp collisions r aaij et al lhcb collab arxiv 1112.0938 submitted to prl fit result agreement with no cp violation cl 0.00128 combination plot the combination plot shows the measurements listed in the table above for a cp and a  where the bands represent 1 intervals the point of no cp violation 0 0 is shown as a filled circle and two dimensional 68 cl 95 cl and 99.7 cl regions are plotted as ellipses from the fit the change in  2 from the minimum value for the no cpv point 0 0 is 13.33 this corresponds to a cl of 0.00128 for two degrees of freedom thus the data is consistent with no cp violation at 0.128 cl the central values and 1 errors for the individual parameters are a cp ind 0.019 0.232 a cp dir 0.645 0.180 comparison plots the comparison plots show the measurements listed in the table above for a cp and a  excluding the lhcb result for a cp where the bands represent 1 intervals the point of no cp violation 0 0 is shown as a filled circle and two dimensional 68 cl 95 cl and 99.7 cl regions are plotted as ellipses the right hand plot has the lhcb result for a cp superimposed without it being included in the fit from the fit the change in  2 from the minimum value for the no cpv point 0 0 is 2.578 this corresponds to a cl of 0.2755 for two degrees of freedom thus the data is consistent with no cp violation at 27.6 cl the central values and 1 errors for the individual parameters are a cp ind 0.030 0.232 a cp dir 0.423 0.270 this page is maintained by m gersabeck and a schwartz and was last updated 11 23 2011 03 04 22
