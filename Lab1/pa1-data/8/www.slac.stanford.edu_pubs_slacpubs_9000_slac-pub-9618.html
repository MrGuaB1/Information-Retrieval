slac pub 9618 measurement of the ckm matrix element vub with b rho e nu decays slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 9618 measurement of the ckm matrix element v ub with b rho e nu decays abstract we present a measurement of the branching fraction for the rare decays b rho e nu and extract a value for the magnitude of vub one of the smallest elements of the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa quark mixing matrix the results are given for five different calculations of form factors used to parametrize the hadronic current in semileptonic decays using a sample of 55 million bbbar meson pairs recorded with the babar detector at the pep ii e e storage ring we obtain br b0 rho e+ nu 3.29 0.42 0.47 0.60 x 10 4 and vub 3.64 0.22 0.25 0.39 0.56 x10 3 where the uncertainties are statistical systematic and theoretical respectively full text pdf slac pub 9618 183 kb compressed postscript slac pub 9618 264 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 09 jan 2003 11 56 pst by htmlme pl
