agent agent the causative agent of the disease is rhinosporidium seeberi the taxonomic classification of this organism has remained controversial recent genetic analysis of the 18s rrna gene in r seeberi suggests that it is a member of a novel drips clade dermocystidium rossete agent ichthyophonus and psorospermium of aquatic protistan parasites about which relatively little has been discovered fredricks et al 2000 it is the first known human pathogen of this clade the organism was determined to be most closely related to dermocystidium salmonis which contains sporangia that are similar in structure and causes symptoms that mirror those of r seeberi in salmon gill inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia figure 1 phylogenetic classification of rhinosporidium seeberi image from fredricks et al 2000 figure 2 phylogenetic placement of the drips clade image from fredricks et al 2000 however these findings have been countered by observations of structures in the sporangia such as vacuoles vesicles and refractile bodies that are consistent with cell inclusions and photosynthetic membranes found in cyanobacteria ahluwalia 2001 this was also supported by the presence of the cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa in patients with the disease and subsequent isolation of the same organism in water sources in which these patients had swam ahluwalia 1999 nevertheless the evidence appears to be leaning in the direction of classification as a protistan parasite the new name of mesomycetozoa has been proposed for the clade with the new inclusion of r seeberi herr et al 1999
