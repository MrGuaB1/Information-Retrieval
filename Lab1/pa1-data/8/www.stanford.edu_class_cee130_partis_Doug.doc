design parti design parti douglas wu the main driving force behind my design is the protruding window pod in the beginning i wanted large panes of glazing to represent the canvas and have the pods be as the frame that emphasizes the scenery and setting around the house i also originally wanted the form of the pods to imitate the contour lines of the sloping site so there were a mixture of curves and straight pods this concept eventually evolved into the final products which are the large glazing pods with four of them in each of three modules of the house the pods are arranged in a way where the two curved pods are on either side forming a bracket that encloses the two rectangular pods on an elevation level the glazing and the form of the two curved pods literally surround and wrap the module into its own domain generating the feeling that the windows is surrounding the individual the pods with varying height and size create a special kind of rhythm and pattern that reflects an undulating effect as the module slopes up the site the pods can be categorized into three different directions the tall and slender pod that emphasizes a sense of vertical reach the wide pod that emphasizes the breadth of the three modules and the horizontality of the site and the square pod that is more introverted and serves a visual and compositional anchor for the modules the pods are further differentiated from the rest of the house by the different choice of materials where the pods are copper and the walls are white stucco this further emphasizes the protrusion and difference of the pods
