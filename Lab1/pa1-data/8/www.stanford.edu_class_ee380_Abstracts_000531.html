abstract bio computer systems laboratory colloquium 4 15pm wednesday may 31 2000 nec auditorium gates computer science building b03 reverse engineering the brain lloyd watts ph d interval research about the talk reverse engineering the brain lloyd watts ph d interval research corporation by 2010 computers will have memory and processing capacity comparable to lower mammals this means that real time stereo vision hearing locomotion etc in real world environments will be possible computationally but will we have the algorithms to do the computations as robustly and effectively as animals and humans do i am working on literally reverse engineering the brain beginning with the auditory pathway i will show real time demonstrations movies of the various representations of speech and music that are computed in the cochlea cochlear nucleus superior olive and inferior colliculus synchronized with the input sounds i will also demonstrate the world's first real time high resolution 240 tap 10 octave 44 khz sampling cochlear model implemented on a multi fpga board in a pc i will also demonstrate work by an interval colleague dr john woodfill of real time high resolution stereo vision about the speaker lloyd watts holds a b sc in engineering physics from queen's university an m sc in electrical engineering from simon fraser university and a ph d in electrical engineering from the california institute of technology where he studied with professor carver mead he has worked at microtel pacific research in burnaby bc synaptics in san jose arithmos in santa clara and currently is employed at interval research corporation in palo alto his research has concentrated on understanding the computations of the human auditory pathway and implementing and visualizing those computations in real time in the least expensive medium he can find that will get the job done for more information see his website contact information lloyd watts lwatts lloydwatts com
