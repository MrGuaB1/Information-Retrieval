slac pub 8615 random walk model for cell to cell misalignments in accelerator structures slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8615 random walk model for cell to cell misalignments in accelerator structures abstract due to manufacturing and construction errors cells in accelerator structures can be misaligned relative to each other as a consequence the beam generates a transverse wakefield even when it passes through the structure on axis the most important effect is the long range transverse wakefield that deflects the bunches and causes growth of the bunch train projected emittance in this paper the effect of the cell to cell misalignments is evaluated using a random walk model that assumes that each cell is shifted by a random step relative to the previous one the model is compared with measurements of a few accelerator structures full text pdf slac pub 8615 161 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8615 525 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
