dimitris papadopoulos ee360 a performance analysis of the high speed 802.3 15 pan using uwb technology project descriptio page 1 dimitris papadopoulos ee360 a performance analysis of the high speed 802.3 15 pan using uwb technology project description there are suggestions from industry to use the uwb as a physical layer for the ieee 802.15 3 mac protocol xtremespectrum claims that its chipset at 0.18 u cmos and sige can achieve 100mbs data rate and there is a proposal about a new standard ieee 802.15 3a which will be based on uwb technology the ieee802 15 standards aim to short distance 10m pan which can be formed in an add hoc manner next to a 802.11 or wired backplane terminal they aim at high speed applications like streaming video and audio at low power levels in our project we will consider issues related to the effectiveness of a 802.15 3 mac with uwb for its physical layer specifically issues like interference from 802.11 dsss 802.11 fhss 802.15 1 bluetooth and from the uwb itself will be analyzed any advantages or disadvantages from the current 802.15 3 physical layer dqpsk and 5 different channels without fhss will be addressed finally using interference models we will attempt to estimate the number of users that can be supported spatial capacity interested extensions would be to figure out the spatial capacity under a variable data rate references 1 http www xtremespectrum com pdf xsi_trinity_brief pdf 2 impulse radio robert a scholtz and moe z win invited paper ieeepimrc 97 helsinki 3 impulse radio how it works moe z win and robert a scholtz ieee communication letters vol 2 no 1 january 1998 4 ultra wide bandwidth time hopping spread spectrum impulse radio for wireless multiple access communications moe z win robert a scholtz 5 http www xtremespectrum com pdf bi phase_vs_mono phase pdf
