abstract bio stanford ee computer systems colloquium 4 15pm wednesday oct 14 2009 nec auditorium gates computer science building b03 http ee380 stanford edu construction of de novo biological process control circuits parts and engineering principles susan weininger molecular lock corporation about the talk engineers and computer scientists have a training set that is directly applicable to genomic engineering with the advent of molecular lock technology molecular locks are protein assemblies that can turn genes on and off the structure and action of molecular locks makes them uniquely suited to engineering new biological circuits that can run parallel to existing naturally occurring biological circuits biological circuit design using molecular locks has many of the same features of electronic circuits and software including logic elements causal conditions clocks and loops slides there is no downloadable version of the slides for this talk available at this time about the speaker susan weininger studied physics biophysics and circuit theory as an undergraduate at the university of michigan and university of minnesota and added protein chemistry molecular biology and quantum chemistry as a graduate student at uc berkeley and ucsf susan's training as a scientist began when she spent her junior year of college at the university of minnesota studying circuit and control theory and non equilibrium thermodynamics under otto herbert schmitt inventor of the cathode follower the differential amplifier the chopper stabilized amplifier and the schmitt trigger susan is a co inventor of the molecular lock technology along with arthur weininger molecular locks are being developed as diagnostic components therapeutics and cell engineering tools contact information susan weninger molecular lock corporation http www molecularlock com contact html
