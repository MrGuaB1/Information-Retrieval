math 205a midterm november 3 2005 1 a let x a be a measurable space and f x be a function complete the page 1 math 205a midterm november 3 2005 1 a let x a be a measurable space and f x be a function complete the definition f is a measurable if note we gave several equiva lent definitions in class you can give whichever you like but see part b 1 b let fn x n 1 2 3 be a measurable functions and let f x sup fn x n 1 2 using the definition you gave in part a prove that f is a measurable 2 let  be lebesgue outer measure on r define an outer measure  on r by  s  x x s f s where f x x you do not need to prove that  is an outer measure 2 a let p x x 0 prove that p is not  measurable 2 b suppose a r is a lebesgue measurable set such that a a where a x x a prove that a is  measurable 3 suppose that x a  is a measure space and that a1 a2 a3 is a sequence of sets in a let z x x x an for infinitely many n 3 a prove that z a 3 b if  x and if  an  0 for every n prove that  z  4 suppose that f g r r are lebesgue measurable functions with f2 d and g2 d both finite prove that for each y the function x f x g y x is integrable and that  y f x g y x d x defines a bounded function  r r typeset by ams tex 1 page 2 5 let x a  be a measure space suppose that fn x r n 1 2 3 and f x r are nonnegative functions in l1 x a  such that fn x f x for every x 5 a let an x fn x 2f x prove that an fn f 5 b suppose also that fn d f d prove that fn f d 0 hint use part a bonus question if you have extra time let a be a lebesgue measurable subset of r with the following property if x a and y a x y then the midpoint x y 2 a prove that a has lebesgue measure 0 2
