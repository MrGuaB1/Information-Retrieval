neutrino parameters with magical beta beam at ino page 1 neutrino parameters with magical beta beam at ino sanjib kumar agarwalla sandhya choubey amitava raychaudhuri abstract we discuss the physics prospects of an experiment where pure e and or e beta beam is shot from some source location like cern towards the proposed large magnetized iron detector at the india based neutrino observatory ical ino the cern ino distance is close to the so called magic baseline where the impact of the cp phase cp on the oscillation probability and associated parameter correlation and degeneracies are almost negligible and allows for a better measurement of the neutrino mass ordering and 13
