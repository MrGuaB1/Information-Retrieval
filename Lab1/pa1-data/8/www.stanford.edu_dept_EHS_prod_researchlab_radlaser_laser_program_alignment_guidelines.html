stanford university laser safety program laser safety overview stanford univeristy laser safety program laser alignment guidelines exclude unnecessary personnel from the laser area during alignment use low power visible lasers for path simulation of higher power visible or invisible lasers whenever possible wear laser protective eyewear during alignment use special alignment eyewear when circumstances eg wavelength power etc permit their use when aligning invisible eg uv ir beams use beam display devices such as image converter viewers or phosphor cards to locate beams perform alignment tasks using high power lasers at the lowest possible power level use a shutter or beam block to block high power beams at their source except when actually needed during the alignment process use a laser rated beam block to terminate high power beams downstream of the optics being aligned use beam blocks and or laser protective barriers in conditions where alignment beams could stray into areas with uninvolved personnel place beam blocks behind optics eg turning mirrors to terminate beams that might miss mirrors during alignment locate and block all stray reflections before proceeding to the next optical component or section be sure all beams and reflections are properly terminated before high power operation post appropriate area warning signs during alignment procedures where lasers are normally class 1 enclosed alignments should be done only by those who have received laser safety training
