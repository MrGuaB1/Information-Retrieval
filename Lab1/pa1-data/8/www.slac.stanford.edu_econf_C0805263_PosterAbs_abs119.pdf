measurements of neutrino cross section and oscillations depend heavily on neutrino flux predictions such predictions rely on ha page 1 measurements of neutrino cross section and oscillations depend heavily on neutrino flux predictions such predictions rely on hadron nucleus interaction cross section data and yet the data are scarce the e907 main injector particle production mipp experiment at fermilab is a full acceptance spectrometer with excellent particle identification capabilities mipp has collected 15 x 106 events of p's s and k's at various momenta from 5 to 120 gev on several targets spanning the periodic table from hydrogen to uranium including beryllium and carbon in particular mipp has collected hadron production data on a spare numi target using 120 gev c protons from the main injector we review the experiment performance of the spectrometer and show preliminary results of particle production for thin and thick carbon targets
