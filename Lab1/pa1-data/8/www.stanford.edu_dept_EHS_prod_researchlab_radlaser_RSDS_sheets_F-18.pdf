safety sheet nuclide f 18 page 1 radionuclide safety data sheet nuclide f 18 forms all soluble physical characteristics half life 109.74 min type decay ec e+ gamma 0.511 mev 193 beta 0.633 mev maximum hazard category c level low hazard 1 mci to 100 mci b level moderate hazard 100 mci to 10 ci a level high hazard 10 ci external radiation hazards and shielding the gamma exposure rate at 1 cm from 5 mci is 28.2 r hr the exposure rate varies directly with activity and inversely as the square of the distance the 1 10 value layer in lead is 1.6 cm the beta absorbed dose rate at 1 cm from 5 mci is 1500 r hr the range of the 0.633 mev beta is 0.1921 cm in lucite and 0.0907 cm in glass hazards if internally deposited the annual limit on oral intake ali of f 18 corresponding to a whole body guideline gamma exposure rate of 500 mrem year is 5.4 mci dosimetry and bioassay requirements film badges and dosimeter rings are required for all usage of f 18 special problems and precautions 1 because the specific gamma ray constant for f 18 is high 5.65 r cm mci hr syringe shields will be relatively ineffective at attenuating the 0.511 mev annihilation quanta so exposure reduction can best be achieved through avoiding unnecessary holding of the filled syringe prior to injection store stock material and filled syringes in lead pigs unnecessary exposure to personnel and other patients should be minimized by increasing distance from the patient while he is waiting to be scanned the gamma exposure rate at 1 meter from a patient containing 5 mci of f 18 will be approximately 2.5 mr hr 2 segregate wastes with those with half lives less than 4 days eg tc 99m 3 dilute aqueous wastes may be disposed to the sewer system in amounts of up to 1000 uci daily per lab 10 87
