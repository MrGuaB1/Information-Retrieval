since the beginning of this commissioning period november december 1998 the closed orbit drift of a few millimeters in both horizontal and vertical planes in the high energy ring her has been observed because optics coupling and beam size in the ring depend on the closed orbit the drifting of the orbit makes systematic improvement of the machine very difficult if not impossible it is very difficult to keep any experiments repeatable which is crucial for studying the instabilities in the machine in this note we will present some initial measurements and analysis of the problem
