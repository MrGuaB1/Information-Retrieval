iib spring 99 paper no 1 t sumiyoshi production of a new generation of silica aerogel and its application for the kek b factory experiment full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract low refractive index silica aerogel is the most convenient radiator for threshold type cherenkov counters which is used for particle identification in high energy physics experiments for the belle detector at the kek b factory we have produced about 2 m 3 of hydrophobic silica aerogels of n 1.01 1.03 using a new production method the particle identification capability of the aerogel cherenkov counters was tested and 3 sigma pion proton separation has been achieved at 3.5 gev c radiation hardness of the aerogels was confirmed up to 9.8 mrad thanks to the improved transparency aerogels prepared by the two step method can be used as radiators for not only threshold type but also for ring imaging type cherenkov counters the newly developed aerogels will be used extensively for particle identification devices in future high energy physics experiments last modified 7 april 1999 jochen
