alignment measurement of an x band accelerator structure using beam induced dipole signals page 1 alignment measurement of an x band accelerator structure using beam induced dipole signals chris adolphsen stanford linear accelerator center stanford california abstract precise beam to structure alignment is critical for the acceleration of small emittance beams in linear accelerators for the next linear collider nlc a prototype accelerator structure has been developed in which the beam induced dipole mode signals can be readily accessed and processed to extract alignment information in a test in the slc linac we used these signals to measure the internal alignment of the structure and to steer the beam in an attempt to minimize its wakefield we used a second bunch to directly measure the wakefield and inferred from the results that a better than 40 micron alignment had been achieved in this paper we review these results and describe how we want to implement this alignment scheme for the approximately ten thousand structures in the nlc paper not available for publication
