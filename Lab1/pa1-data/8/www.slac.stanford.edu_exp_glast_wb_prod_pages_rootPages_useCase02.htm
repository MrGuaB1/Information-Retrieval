use case ii creating histograms print version use case ii creating histograms using root's commands to improve the quality of the resulting plots a number of settings can be used to make the plots that root generates look better than the default here are examples of different commands note gstyle is one of root's global variables used to control the overall settings for all plots gstyle setstatw 0.30 gstyle setstath 0.20 gstyle setstatcolor 42 gstyle setoptstat 10 suppose t1 is a ttree then you can set the following t1 setlinewidth 4 t1 setmarkerstyle 4 t1 setmarkersize 0.5 t1 setmarkercolor 4 t1 setfillcolor 5 tkr cal acd this use case will demonstrate looking at the acd active distance distribution start up root and open the root summary ntuple and access the ntuple ttree as demonstrated in use case i set up to create plots as demonstrated in use case ii create the tcuts to be applied when creating the new histogram in this case we wish only to keep those events that had 3 in a row in the tkr gltword & 4 an active distance value over 200 acdactivedist 200 at least one reconstructed track tkrnumtracks 0 now create a 1 dimensional histogram for activedistance using the command t draw acdactivedist trackcut && threeinarow && goodactivedist this should produce a histogram simalar to owned by heather kelly last updated by chuck patterson 02 08 2005 back to top
