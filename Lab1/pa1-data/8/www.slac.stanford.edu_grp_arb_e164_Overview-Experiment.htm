e164 & e164x plasma wakefield accelerator e164 & e164x plasma wakefield accelerator experiment overview prospective students papers people run time presentations home purpose experiment general links faq e164 & e164x experiment these experiments all take place at the stanford linear accelerator center slac in the final focus test beam fftb for the e164 & e164x experiments we are working to attain ultrahigh gradient plasma wakefield acceleration ultrahigh gradient in this context refers to peak acceleration gradients of 10 gev m these accelerating gradients are now possible due to the inclusion of a chicane installed along the linac as well as a dogleg at the beginning of the fftb this chicane and dogleg combination allows us to compress the bunch length of the incoming electron beam from 600 microns e157 & e162 parameters down to 50 12 microns for the e164 experiments the accelerating gradient of the pwfa is inversely proportional to the square of the bunch length so a change in bunch from 600 microns to 12 microns should increase the accelerating gradient by 2500 we believe that a successful demonstration of this experiment will be a truly significant and defining accomplishment in the advanced accelerator research field page maintained by caolionn o connell slac date created dec 04 2003
