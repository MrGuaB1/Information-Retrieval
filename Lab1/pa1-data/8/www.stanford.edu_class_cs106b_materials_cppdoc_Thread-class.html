class thread the stanford c++ libraries include thread h class thread the thread class encapsulates a lightweight process running in the same address space as the creator the class itself is opaque and is manipulated by top level functions as illustrated in the following paradigm thread child fork fn code for the parent thread join child this code calls fn so that it runs in parallel with the parent code constructor thread creates an inactive thread variable that will typically be overwritten by the result of a fork call method tostring converts the thread to a string functions fork fn fork fn data creates a child thread that calls fn in an address space shared with the current thread join thread waits for the specified thread to finish before proceeding yield yields the processor to allow another thread to run getcurrentthread returns the currently executing thread constructor detail thread creates an inactive thread variable that will typically be overwritten by the result of a fork call usage thread thread method detail string tostring converts the thread to a string usage string str thread tostring function detail thread fork void fn thread fork void fn clienttype & data clienttype & data creates a child thread that calls fn in an address space shared with the current thread the second form makes it possible to pass an argument to fn which may be of any type usage thread child fork fn thread child fork fn data void join thread & thread waits for the specified thread to finish before proceeding usage join thread void yield yields the processor to allow another thread to run usage yield thread getcurrentthread returns the currently executing thread usage thread self getcurrentthread
