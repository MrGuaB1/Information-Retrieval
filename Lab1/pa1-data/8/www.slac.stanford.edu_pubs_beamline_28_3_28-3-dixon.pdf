foreword page 1 2 fall winter 1998 foreword very few seconds a subatomic particle with the kinetic energy of a well thrown baseball approximately 10 20 electron volts strikes somewhere in the earth's upper atmosphere un leashing a magnificent cascade of up to one hundred billion particles over an area of several square miles unfortunately the show is over in a few nanoseconds and most of the time no one is there to watch it it is a shame to miss not only the fireworks but also the chance to learn about the particle's birthplace clearly this must be in some extreme environment for instance near a supermassive black hole at the center of an active galaxy but we don t really know where an other mystery stems from the prediction by greisen zatsepin and kuzmin that cosmic ray protons above about 1020 ev should be rapidly degraded by interactions with the cosmic microwave back ground yet no falloff has been seen to date the trajectories of cosmic rays of such tremendous energies are bent very little by galactic magnetic fields so that with more than the present handful of observed events one could begin to do astronomy by identifying individual sources on the sky in this is sue of the beam line paul mantsch describes the two techniques that have been used to detect the highest energy cosmic rays giant air shower arrays that sample the debris of the cascade once it reach es the ground and telescopes that capture the distant flash of fluo rescing air molecules excited by the ionizing radiation he also gives an overview of the pierre auger project named after an early pioneer in cosmic ray physics which plans in the next few years to combine both approaches and provide us with our best clues to the origin of these particles as gaurang yodh points out in the second article in this issue gamma rays being neutral also point back to their birthplace and at tev energies their air showers can be detected by related tech niques detection of cerenkov radiation supplants the fluorescence approach in this case the challenge in high energy gamma ray astronomy is to suppress the much more copious charged particles of the same energy but this can be done and tev gamma rays have e page 2 beam line 3 been traced back to at least a couple of active galaxies several new detectors are in the works in this field as well virginia trimble puts this extraterrestrial high energy frontier into perspective in her usual inimitable style finally we return to earth for rein hard brinkmann's description of a proposed accel erator at the terrestrial high energy frontier the tesla superconducting linear collider in the winter 1997 issue of the beam line vol 27 no 4 we announced three new con tributing editors gordon fraser from cern judy jackson from fermilab and pedro waloschek from desy these talented people have already helped us by authoring editing and alerting us to interest ing articles in particle physics with their help we have america and europe pretty well covered but we have been missing a contributing editor from asia accordingly akihiro maki from the national laboratory for high energy physics kek in tsukuba japan will fill that role maki joined kek in 1972 right after its establishment to build the first proton synchrotron in japan during his 26 year career there he has worked on experiments at fer milab and rutherford laboratory in addition to ones at kek he served as the director of the washington liaison office of the japan society for the promo tion of science jsps to promote academic collab oration and exchange of researchers between the united states and japan he has since returned to kek and we are pleased to have him as a contri buting editor akihiro maki at the gastown steam clock vancouver british columbia july 1998 lance dixon
