slac pub 8204 test of low scale quantum gravity in ee and gamma gamma collisions slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8204 test of low scale quantum gravity in e e and gamma gamma collisions abstract arkani hamed dimopoulos and dvali have recently proposed that gravity may become strong at energies near 1 tev due to the existence of large extra dimensions thus removing the hierarchy problem in this talk we examine the exchange of towers of kaluza klein gravitons and their influence on moller scattering as well as the production of pairs of massive gauge bosons in collisions these tower exchanges lead to a set of new dimension 8 operators that can significantly alter the standard model expectations for these processes in the case of collisions the role of polarization for both the initial state photons and the final state gauge bosons in improving sensitivity to graviton exchange is emphasized full text pdf slac pub 8204 241 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8204 112 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info techexplorer slac pub 8204 21.1 kb notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
