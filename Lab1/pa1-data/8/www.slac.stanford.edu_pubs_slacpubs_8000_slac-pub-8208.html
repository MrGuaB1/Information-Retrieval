slac pub 8208 surface impedance and synchronous modes slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8208 surface impedance and synchronous modes abstract the concept of the surface impedance is applicable to the case when obstacles on the surface of a vacuum chamber are small compared to characteristic dimensions of the problem we apply this concept to the calculation of a synchronous mode that can propagate in a tube with slightly corrugated walls we also show that such a mode can propagate in a pipe with a rough surface or a perforated pipe with a large number of holes full text pdf slac pub 8208 213 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8208 268 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
