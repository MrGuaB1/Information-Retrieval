ee 254 principles of radar systems principles of radar systems winter 2005 2006 home class info syllabus references homework software announcements class information this course comprises primarily lecture material supplemented by readings from class handouts and other references lecture notes organized by topic will be handed out routinely constituting a text special handouts will also be distributed from time to time reading assignments will be given for most class meetings these may be from handouts or from other sources most of which will be on reserve at terman engineering library problem assignments will generally be given on thursdays and collected on thursdays with the graded work handed back by the following monday or wednesday cooperation on homework is encouraged but you are expected to keep the work on an approximately equal basis we plan one midterm exam plus a final term project grades will be based on the totality of your work with weightings of approximately 40 on the final project 25 on the midterm 30 on homework and up to 5 extra credit problems and so forth a course syllabus and a list of reference books are attached assigned readings will usually be from this list you may also find that a particular book presents material in ways you can more easily understand so look around for a book with which you are comfortable there is a number of works on this general subject area at the bookstore although there is no specific course text apart from the lecture note handouts some recommended books are i modern radar system analysis by david k barton ii bistatic radar by nj willis iii high resolution radar by dr wehner iv aspects of modern radar by eli brookner ed and v synthetic aperture radar by curlander and mcdonough in the past the book radar principles by levanon has been used as a text this work provides an overview that roughly parallels portions of this course some students find levanon a useful adjunct but we do not recommend it radar is an exciting eclectic subject that incorporates concepts and results from a range of electrical engineering and other disciplines to synthesize new systems and techniques for remote sensing and measurements the result is a field that stands alone as a specialty with very wide applications in science and engineering at the same time many techniques first considered as radar have found uses in a variety of other fields such as seismic surveying acoustic imaging and underwater sound your instructors hope you will find the course interesting satisfying and useful here we will take as broad a view as possible focusing on underlying principles to introduce and build competence in this field
