designing courses backward page 1 designing courses backwards a forward looking approach to effective teaching you ve got your calendar in one hand and your content in the other you are ready to design your course what will i cover but wait that is forward thinking and the most successful courses are designed backward what should they learn or even more boldly what should they remember next quarter or next year step 1 consider your own rationale for teaching this class what is important to you about the material about the way you plan to teach the material about how the students interact with the content step 2 skip directly to the end of the course distill five or fewer major learning outcomes if this number is too small for comfort you can add more later if you really must but stick with 5 or less now this is the way to get to the underlying often unifying themes of your course think broadly about these outcomes content or foundational knowledge is but one broad category in which you might have specific goals for other ideas turn to the back of this page step 3 work backwards what skills will demonstrate achievement of the learning goals what content is required to support those skills why bother some of the best payoffs include the outcome goals will be threaded throughout the course they provide unifying themes and context for the material you cover these choices define the skills embedded in homework projects exams etc students who have met the learning goals will be able to do what student work becomes more obviously relevant to the topic exam questions or projects become more authentic this process helps distill the huge content problem cutting content is always painful but we know we have to do it working backwards establishes priorities learning outcome content skills
