heavy flavor averaging group home page home results documentation organization oscillations semileptonic rare decays unitarity triangle b to charm charm physics tau physics the heavy flavor averaging group hfag was established at the may 2002 flavor physics and cp violation conference philadelphia and continues the lep heavy flavor steering group s tradition of providing regular updates to the world averages of heavy flavor quantities the latest averages can be found at d asner et al averages of b hadron c hadron and tau lepton properties arxiv 1010.1589 and online update at http www slac stanford edu xorg hfag this group is currently organized into six sub groups that focus on a different set of heavy flavor measurements b lifetimes and oscillation parameters semi leptonic b decays rare b decays unitarity triangle parameters b decays to charm final states charm physics tau physics click on the links above for more information about this group and its sub groups this page is maintained by alan schwartz and was last updated site meter
