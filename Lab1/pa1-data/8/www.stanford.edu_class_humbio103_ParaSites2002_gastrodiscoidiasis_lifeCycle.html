life cycle gastrodiscoidiasis parasites and pestilence infectious public health challenges david kaufman life cycle gastrodiscoides eggs are passed unembryonated in the feces if the eggs reach water they will embryonate into larva within 17 days after that the lifecycle is not well known but it is thought to be similar to other trematodes the newly embryonated larva in water are at a stage called miracidia development cannot proceed unless the larva is ingested by a snail this is typical of trematodes as each species requires a molluscan intermediate host usually a clam or snail for development without which the trematode cannot develop once the miracidia are eaten by the intermediate host snail the larva progress to the sporocyst stage still within the snail the sporocysts become redia 28 to 150 days after entering the snail the final stage of growth occurs as the redia mature to cercaria the cercaria then leave the snail at which point they must attach to vegetation and secrete a resistant cyst wall when encysted on plants g hominis are called metacercariae this is the infective stage of the trematodes the metacercaria encyst on water vegetation such as the water caltrop where they will remain until eaten by a final host water caltrops thrive in ponds fertilized by night soil human feces humans are infected when the metacercaria are ingested infective metacercaria progress through the gastrointestinal tract and excyst in the duodenum then continue down intestine to the cecum g hominis is hermaphroditic so it self fertilizes in the intestine the organism attaches to the cecum and ascending colon where the adult lays eggs by the thousands these eggs are exuded in the feces
