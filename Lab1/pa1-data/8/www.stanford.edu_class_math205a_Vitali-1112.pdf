vitali covering theorem theorem let s rn and suppose f is a collection of closed balls of positive radii such that f cover page 1 vitali covering theorem theorem let s rn and suppose f is a collection of closed balls of positive radii such that f covers s finely then there is a sequence b1 b2 of disjoint balls in f such that 1 s i kbi i k  bi for every k and such that 2  s ibi 0 here as in the 5 times covering lemma if b is a closed ball then b is the closed ball with the same center and with five times the radius note that s is not assumed to be measurable proof we may assume that the diameters of the balls in b are all less than 1 otherwise replace f by the subcollection consisting of those balls with diameters less than 1 let d be the disjoint subcollection given by the 5 times covering lemma since d is a collection of disjoint balls in rn it is countable d b1 b2 assertion 1 is the corollary to the 5 times covering lemma fix an r 0 and let sr x s x r let b1 b2 be the collection of balls b in d such that b sr since  bi has diameter 5 and since it contains a point in sr it must lie in the closed ball b 0 r 5 of radius 5 centered at the origin since the bi are disjoint 3 bi  ibi b 0 r 5 by 1 sr i kbi i k  bi for every k thus sr ibi sr ibi i k  bi so  sr ibi i k   bi 5n i k  bi which tends to 0 as k by 3 thus  sr ibi 0 since this is true for each sr it is also true for s s1 s2 d date november 2010 1
