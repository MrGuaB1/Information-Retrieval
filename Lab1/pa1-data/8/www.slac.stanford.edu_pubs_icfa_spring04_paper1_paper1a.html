iib spring 2004 paper no 1 a boyarski model of high current breakdown from cathode field emission in aged wire chambers full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract observing single electron pulses provides insight into the mechanism that leads to sudden high current jumps breakdown in aged wire chambers this single electron activity is found to be consistent with the fowler nordheim equation for field emission of electrons from a cathode surface in a high electric field the high electric field arises from the positive ion buildup on a very thin insulating layer on the cathode surface a model is presented to explain the transient behavior of single electron pulses in response to abrupt changes in chamber ionization as well as the steady state rate during a long term aging run the model is based on properties of the insulating layer dielectric constant conductivity and hole mobility as well as the fowler nordheim equation full article last modified 5 april 2004 j schwiening
