poster template page 1 decomposition into rotation and translation we can determine the rotation matrix translation matrix and normal vector because of the scale ambiguity two possible solutions for r t n exist choose the right solution by assuming that motion is small homography estimation using ransac homographies are valid for planar scenes or for pure rotation general 3d scenes contain planes or can be approximated as planar use ransac to calculate h and determine inliers if more than 80 of points are inliers pass the model cost function weighing correlation and distance find matches based on cost if a single keypoint has two potential matches pass both and let ransac deal with the wrong match incremental calculation of shi tomasi corners if f x f y threshold1 calculate hessian matrix if trace m threshold2 calculate cornerness if cornerness threshold3 inclu de in local extrema calculations incremental calculation allows corner detection algorithm to run faster real time camera pose estimation for virtual reality navigation arthur louis alaniz ii christina marianne mantaring department of electrical engineering stanford university virtual reality navigation camera pose estimation feature detection experimental results camera movement in the real world motion in the virtual world shi tomasi corners m f x 2 f x f y f x f y f y 2 c min  1 m  2 m homography estimation x i y i 1 h 11 h 12 h 13 h 21 h 22 h 23 h 31 h 32 h 33 x i y i 1 choose 4 pairs and solve for h such that aquire camera image corner detection feature matching homography estimation homography decomposition redraw 3d environment h  r+ 1 d tnt t r3 3 cornerness based on original st cornerness based on speeded up st estimated pose regions included in local max calculations number of calculations vs threshold1 number of calculations vs threshold2 number of calculations vs threshold3 st corners percentage of inliers over successive frames matching keypoints
