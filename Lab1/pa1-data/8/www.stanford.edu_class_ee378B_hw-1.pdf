k means page 1 ee378b statistical signal processing k means andrea montanari lecture 1 2 due on 4 5 2011 exercise 1 program the k means algorithm in its incremental version for x1 xn rm and d x y x y2 2 at each step you need to compute the change in cost due to change of group of one data point how can this be done efficiently test your program by taking n 100 m 2 and x1 xn iid with density  x 1 3  x a1 1 3  x a2 1 3  x a3 1 where  z is the standard gaussian density and al a cos 2l 3 a sin 2l 3 for some a 0 report the results of this test exercise 2 give an example of a dataset x1 xn and a clustering s s1 sk such that incremental k means leaves s unchanged but s is not globally optimal exercise 3 in class we proved a spectral lower bound on the optimal cost mins c s whereby c s is the cost minimized by k means for quadratic distances give an example of a dataset x1 xn such that this lower bound is tight
