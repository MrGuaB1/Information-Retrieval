the lvd experiment as a low background facility in the gran sasso laboratory page 1 the lvd experiment as a low background facility in the gran sasso laboratory w fulgione for the lvd collaboration march 31 2008 the large volume detector lvd in the gran sasso laboratory of infn is a modular detector mainly devoted to search for neutrinos from core collapse supernovae it is made of 1000 tons of liquid scintillator divided in 840 stainless steel tanks 1.5 m3 each in this study we present the possibility for lvd to work both as a passive shield and moderator for the gamma and neutron background and as an active veto to reduce the higher energy background coming from muon induced neutrons an inner region inside the lvd structure lvd core facility can be identified with a volume of about 30m3 with the neutron background typical of an underground laboratory placed at a much deeper site this region can be realized with a negligible impact on the lvd operation and its sensitive mass the lvd core facility could be effectively exploited by a compact experiment for the search of rare events such as double beta decay or dark matter a possible candidate could be a liquid xenon double phase detector 1
