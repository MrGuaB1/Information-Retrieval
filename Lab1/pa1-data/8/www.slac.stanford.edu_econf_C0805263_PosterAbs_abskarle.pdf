abstract neutrino 08 page 1 enhanced energy reach of icecube albrecht karle and dima chirkin for the icecube collaboration to improve icecubes sensitivity to high energy neutrinos the spacing between strings may be increased in the last row deployed in the detectors final phase of construction we consider several detector geometry possibilities and demonstrate a significant increase in the expected number of events at 0.5 to 500 pev with a similar improvement for the signal expectation from gzk neutrinos advantages for simultaneous detection of neutrinos by acoustic and radio methods are also discussed
