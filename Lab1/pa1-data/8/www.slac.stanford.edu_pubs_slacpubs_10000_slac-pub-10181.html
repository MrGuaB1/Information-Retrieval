slac pub 10181 correlated fluctuations between luminescence and ionization in liquid xenon slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 10181 correlated fluctuations between luminescence and ionization in liquid xenon abstract the ionization of liquefied noble gases by radiation is known to be accompanied by fluctuations much larger than predicted by poisson statistics we have studied the fluctuations of both scintillation and ionization in liquid xenon and have measured for the first time a strong anti correlation between the two at a microscopic level with coefficient 0.80 rho_ ep 0.60 this provides direct experimental evidence that electron ion recombination is partially responsible for the anomalously large fluctuations and at the same time allows substantial improvement of calorimetric energy resolution full text pdf slac pub 10181 511 kb compressed postscript slac pub 10181 556 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 30 sep 2003 14 37 pdt by htmlme pl
