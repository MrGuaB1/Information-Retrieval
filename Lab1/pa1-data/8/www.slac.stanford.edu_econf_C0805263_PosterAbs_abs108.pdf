limit on non standard interactions from the atmospheric neutrino data in super kamiokande page 1 limit on non standard interactions from the atmospheric neutrino data in super kamiokande g mitsuka for the super kamiokande collaboration institute for cosmic ray research university of tokyo we have searched for neutrino induced non standard interaction with the whole atmospheric neutrino data in super kamiokande i and ii present data from atmospheric neutrino are ex plained well with 2flavor   oscillations however there is a room for neutrino induced non standard interaction as a sub dominant channel we analyzed the atmospheric neutrino data in super kamiokande i and ii with non standard interaction taken into account
