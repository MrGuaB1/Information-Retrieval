slac pub 10141 measurements of the branching fractions of charged b decays to k+ pi pi+ final states slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 10141 measurements of the branching fractions of charged b decays to k+ pi pi+ final states abstract we present results of searches for b meson decays to k+ pi pi+ with the babar detector with a data sample of 61.6 million bbbar pairs we measure the branching fractions and 90 confidence level upper limits averaged over charge conjugate states the first error is statistical and the second is systematic b+ k 0 pi+ 15.5 1.8 1.5 4.0 x 10 6 b+ f0 k+ f_0 pi+ pi 9.2 1.2 2.1 2.6 x 10 6 b+ d0bar pi+ d0bar k+ pi 184.6 3.2 9.7 x 10 6 b+ rho k+ 6.2 x 10 6 and b+ k+ pi pi+ non resonant 17 x 10 6 full text pdf slac pub 10141 511 kb compressed postscript not available for this document notes the present version of slac pub 10141 was revised july 2004 from the original version published at slac in april 2004 more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 28 jul 2004 10 14 pdt by htmlme pl
