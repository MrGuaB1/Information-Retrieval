cs244a winter 2001 cs244a introduction to computer networks should i take ee284 or cs244a you may have noticed the similarity between cs244a and ee284 and be asking yourself which class should i take the material covered by both classes is essentially the same the lecture material is almost identical and both classes cover the same topics the main difference is that cs244a has a stronger emphasis on network programming and so has three large programming assignments a competent c os programmer who has taken cs140 a prerequisite should be quite comfortable with the programming assignments in cs244a
