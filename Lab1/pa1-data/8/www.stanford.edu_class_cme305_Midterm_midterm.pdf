cme 305 discrete mathematics and algorithms problem 1 show that a graph has a unique minimum spanning tree if for every cut o page 1 cme 305 discrete mathematics and algorithms instructor professor amin saberi saberi stanford edu midterm 02 16 10 problem 1 show that a graph has a unique minimum spanning tree if for every cut of the graph the edge with the smallest cost across that cut is unique show that the converse is not true by giving a counterexample problem 2 the edge connectivity  g of an undirected graph g v e is defined as the cardinality of a minimum set of edges s e whose removal disconnects g give a polynomial time algorithm for computing  g problem 3 recall the job scheduling problem we have m machines and n jobs such that any machine j takes time ti to process job i let aj be the set of jobs assigned to machine j in that case tj i aj ti will be the load of machine j our goal is to find an assignment of jobs to machines that would minimize maxj tj denote this minimum value opt consider a slightly modified greedy approach to the one showed in class first we sort the jobs so that t1 t2 tn then we assign them iteratively to the machines every time to the machine with the smallest load show that the approximation factor of this algorithm is at most 3 2 hint note that if n m then tm 1 opt 2 why is this true extra credit prove that the approximation factor of the algorithm is actually equal to 4 3
