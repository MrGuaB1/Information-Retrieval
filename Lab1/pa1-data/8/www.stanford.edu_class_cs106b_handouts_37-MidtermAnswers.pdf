answers to midterm exam page 1 eric roberts handout 37 cs106b february 13 2012 answers to midterm exam congratulations as a class you knocked this one out of the park from talking with the section leaders my sense is that exam was a bit too easy but that most of you are really on top of the material given the independent corroborative evidence from the section leaders who tell me that things are going well i ve decided to assign a high curve of the sort i think you deserve the complete histogram appears on page 2 but here are a few noteworthy statistics n 392 median 55.0 mean 53.7 the scale to letter grades looks like this grade range n a+ 60 31 a 56 59 74 a 54 55 44 b+ 52 53 31 b 49 51 31 b 47 48 23 c+ 45 46 14 c 42 44 8 c 40 41 5 d 33 39 3 np 00 32 7 page 2 2 histogram 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 58 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 54 57 60 54 57 60 53 57 60 53 57 60 53 57 60 53 57 60 53 57 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 53 56 60 52 56 60 52 56 60 52 56 60 52 56 60 52 56 60 52 56 60 49 52 56 60 49 52 56 60 49 52 56 60 49 52 56 60 49 52 56 60 49 52 56 60 49 52 56 60 49 52 56 60 49 52 56 60 49 52 55 60 49 52 55 60 49 52 55 60 48 52 55 60 48 52 55 60 48 52 55 60 48 52 55 60 48 51 55 60 48 51 55 60 48 51 55 60 48 51 55 60 48 51 55 60 47 51 55 60 47 51 55 60 47 51 55 60 47 51 55 60 47 51 55 60 47 51 55 60 47 51 55 60 44 46 51 55 60 44 46 51 55 60 44 46 51 55 60 44 46 50 55 60 44 45 50 55 60 44 45 50 55 60 44 45 50 55 60 43 45 50 55 60 43 45 50 55 60 43 45 50 55 60 43 45 50 55 60 43 45 50 55 60 34 43 45 50 55 60 33 39 43 45 50 55 60 33 38 41 45 50 55 60 29 31 37 41 45 50 55 60 12 28 31 36 41 45 50 55 60 page 3 3 problem 1 tracing c++ programs and big o 10 points the mystery function runs through its argument and concatenates each letter either at the beginning or end of the string depending on whether its index is odd or even the succession of strings created in the course of calling mystery retest is r re tre tree stree street in problems like this i like having the answer be an english word so that those of you who get the right answer can have some confidence in that fact i was intrigued to discover that the longest english word in the lexicon that produces a word after this transformation is the eight letter word loblolly a mire or mudhole which transforms into itself in each cycle of the loop the code performs some operations that are linear time in the length of the current string and some operations that are constant time as n grows large the constant time terms become unimportant so the calculation depends only on the linear time portions the actual running time can therefore be approximated by some constant per cycle cost times the lengths in question which over the course of the entire program is the sum 1 2 3 4 n the computational complexity is therefore o n2 page 4 4 problem 2 vectors grids stacks and queues 10 points problem 3 lexicons maps and iterators 15 points there are several strategies that you could use to implement this problem i believe that the simplest strategy is to calculate the result recursively as follows you can however also code the solution iteratively using a stack or a vector to keep track of the values you need to insert into the cache page 5 5 problem 4 recursive functions 10 points problem 5 recursive procedures 15 points
