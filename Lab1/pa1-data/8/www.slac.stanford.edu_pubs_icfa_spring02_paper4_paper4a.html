iib spring 2002 paper no 4 m capeans aging of gaseous detectors assembly materials and procedures full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract aging of gaseous detectors is known as the degradation of their performance under the exposure to ionizing radiation it is a complex phenomenon that depends on many parameters among others aging depends on the gas mixture and may be enhanced by the presence of pollutants in the gas the origin of the impurities is diverse and includes outgassing from assembly materials and the gas system components and contamination of the detector during the assembly process systematic studies on this topic have been carried out methods used to ascertain the outgassing properties of materials are described and compared materials that might be used for assembling gaseous detectors and associated gas systems are catalogued according to their outgassing rate some factors affecting the aging rate in some fast gases are presented finally a set of recommendations to build and operate gaseous detectors in high luminosity experiments is given full article last modified 15 april 2002 j schwiening
