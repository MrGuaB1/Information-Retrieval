current developments the quest for a leishmaniasis vaccine history research and development home leishmaniasis links and references vaccine history research clinical trials global implications current developments female phlebotomus sandfly cdc vector vaccines the results of animal trials have provided evidence that components of sandfly saliva are inolved in the progression of leishmania infection after a sandfly bite thus it is hypothesized that pre exposure to the saliva of an uninfected sandfly can induce some degree of immunity to the saliva and thus be protective against future leishmania infection as such the possibility of a sandfly saliva based vaccine in humans is being pursued reservoir vaccines the end of canine leishmaniasis since dogs are a major reservoir for a host of leishmania species a great deal of research has been conducted with respect to the development of a canine vaccine as of yet no vaccination has been approved for general veterinary use however vaccine trials in dogs have yielded many of the same results as trials in humans in particualr multi component dna vaccines have induced partial immunity in the form of a delayed type hypersensitivity response and they have helped to decrease parasitic load in leishmania infected dogs it is hoped that in the future a vaccine will be derived particularly for canine visceral leishmaniasis strains given the pathology of these strains in humans photo caption dogs as seen here can also develop ulcers and become reservoirs of infection who tdr mark edwards
