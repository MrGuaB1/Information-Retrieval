abstract bio computer systems laboratory colloquium 4 15pm wednesday may 17 2000 nec auditorium gates computer science building b03 fundamental issues in scaling cmos devices paul packan intel corp about the talk for more than 30 years the computer industry has relied heavily on the ability to increase the speed of the mos silicon tranistor this increase in speed has come largely through the downward scaling of the physical dimensions of the device at the same time the doping concentrations in the device have had to increase to maintain good electrical isolation and low resistance this talk will discuss some of the potential problems in the continued conventional scaling of the mos device issues in scaling both physical thicknesses as well as dopant concentrations will be addressed in addition current methods to improve transistor performance through source drain and well engineering will be explained about the speaker paul packan currently manages the process and device modeling group at intel corporation in hillsboro oregon his primary interests are in the simulation and development of process technologies he has been involved in the development of the past three technology generations at intel corporation prior to intel corporation packan spent two years working in the area of bipolar transistor design at seimens ag in munich germany packan received his bs degree in electrical engineering from the university of washington and is ms and ph d degrees in electrical engineering from stanford university in the area of silicon defect and dopant diffusion modeling contact information paul packan 5200 ne elam young pkwy hillsboro or 97124 503 613 9869 503 613 9850 paul a packan intel com
