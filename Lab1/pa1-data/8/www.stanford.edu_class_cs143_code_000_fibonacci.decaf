file fibonacci decaf author keith schwarz htiek cs stanford edu a sample decaf program that computes fibonacci numbers in two ways recursive version of the fibonacci numbers int fibonaccirec int n if n 1 return n decaf supports recursion return fibonaccirec n 1 fibonaccirec n 2 iterative version of fibonacci int fibonacciiterative int n variables must be declared at the top of a block and do not support initialization on declaration int a int b a 0 b 1 while n 0 new variables can be declared at the top of a block int c compute the next values in the sequence c a b a b b c decaf does not support or nor does it support compound assignment etc n n 1 return a int main print the tenth fibonacci number is print fibonaccirec 10 print n print the twentieth fibonacci number is print fibonacciiterative 20 print n
