giardia lifecycle g intestinalis lifecycle 1 2 giardia cysts are the infective stage of g intestinalis as few as 10 cysts can cause infection 1 these cysts are ingested by consuming contaminated food or water or fecal orally they can survive outside the body for several months and are also relatively resistant to chlorination uv exposure and freezing 19 3 when cysts are ingested the low ph of the stomach acid produces excystation in which the activated flagella breaks through the cyst wall 1 this occurs in the small intestine specifically the duodenum 19 excystation releases trophozoites with each cyst producing two trophozoites 13 4 within the small intestine the trophozoites reproduce asexually longitudinal binary fission and either float free or are attached to the mucosa of the lumen 13 5 some trophozoites then encyst in the small intestine 13 encystation occurs most likely as a result of exposure to bile salts and fatty acids and a more alkaline environment 7 both cysts and trophozoites are then passed in the feces and are infectious immediately or shortly afterward 13 person to person transmission is possible 13 animals can also be infected with giardia and beavers have been associated with giardia outbreaks although not definitively 5 http www dpd cdc gov dpdx html giardiasis htm
