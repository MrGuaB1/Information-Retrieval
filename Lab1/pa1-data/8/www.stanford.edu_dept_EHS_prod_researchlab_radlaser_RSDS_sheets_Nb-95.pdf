nb 95 data page 1 radionuclide safety data sheet nuclide nb95 forms all soluble physical characteristics half life 35 days type decay beta maximum energy 0.16 mev gamma rays 0.765 mev 100 1.121 mev 100 hazard category c level low hazard 1 mci to 100 mci external radiation hazards and shielding the dose rate from betas at 1 cm from an unshielded 1 mci dried sample of nb95 assuming no backscatter or self absorption in the source is 20 mrads per hour the exposure rate at 1 cm from 1 mci due to photons is 4.34 rads per hour dose rates vary directly with activity and over short distances inversely with the square of the distance from the source maximum range of the betas is 0.01 inches in plastic the half value layer for the gammas is 0.68 cm of lead hazards if internally deposited the annual limit of intake which would deliver 500 mrems to the whole body is 216 uci based on icrp dosimetry and bioassay requirements film badges and dosimeter rings are required if 5 millicurie is handled or 1 millicurie handled on a frequent daily basis urine assays may be required after spills or contamination incidents special problems and precautions 1 work behind shielding preferably transparent materials survey frequently change gloves often 2 segregate wastes to those with half lives less than 60 days ie may be placed with i 125 wastes 3 limit soluble waste to sewer is 10 microcuries day per lab 11 92
