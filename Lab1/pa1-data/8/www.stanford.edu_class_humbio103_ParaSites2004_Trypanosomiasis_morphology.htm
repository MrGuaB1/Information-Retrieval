morphology morphology t cruzi has three morphological forms the tyrpomastigote the epimastigote and the amastigote trypanosomes are present in the circulating blood they are approximately 20 mm long and generally slender they have a thin irregularly shaped membrane which can be seen using scanning electron microscopy they have a centrally positioned nucleus and a kinetoplast located towards the posterior a flagellum stems from the kinetoplast and runs through the remainder of the parasite and also extends beyond it inside the kinetoplast is the parasite has single mitochondrion which drive the flagellum de souza w a short review on the morphology of t cruzi from 1909 1999 mem inst oswaldo cruz 94 1 17 36 1999 cartoon of trypomastigote form of t cruzi http images google com imgres imgurl www tulane edu wiser protozoology notes images tc_lc_lg gif&imgrefurl when visualized in giemsa stained blood films trypanosomes generally are seen in a c or u shape t cruzi in trypomastigote stage http images google com imgres imgurl www tulane edu wiser protozoology notes images tc_lc_lg gif&imgrefurl the epimastigote is similar to the trypomastigote but the kinetoplast is located anterior to the nucleus t cruzi in the epimastigote stage ttp www ucm es info parasito epimastigotes jpg amastigotes on the other hand are present within cells they are generally round and the flagellum becomes nearly unapparent www ucm es info parasito atlas htm t cruzi in the amastigote stage http www pasteur fr recherche unites tcruzi minoprio tropical chagas chapter3 html in summary here are simplified cartoons of the three morphological stages trypomastigote epimastigote and amastigote respectively http images google com imgres imgurl www tulane edu wiser protozoology notes images tc_lc_lg gif&imgrefurl
