slac pub 5171 computer determination of the external q and resonant frequency of waveguide loaded cavities slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 5171 computer determination of the external q and resonant frequency of waveguide loaded cavities abstract a new method is proposed for determining the q ext of a cavity coupled to a waveguide that is well suited to integration with computer methods for determination of cavity resonant frequencies it is related to but distinct from slater's method which recently has been applied in the same context application of the method to a set of waveguide models with comparison to analytic results is presented an application to a damped accelerator cavity structure using mafia determined resonant frequencies is also given full text pdf slac pub 5171 2.71 mb compressed postscript not available for this document more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 04 pdt by htmlme pl
