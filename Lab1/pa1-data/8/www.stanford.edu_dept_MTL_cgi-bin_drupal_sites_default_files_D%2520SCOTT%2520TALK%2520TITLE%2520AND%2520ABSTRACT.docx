title black abject frantz fanon and james weldon johnson's the autobiography of an ex coloured man this talk drawn from a chapter of extravagant abjection blackness power and sexuality in the african american literary imagination 2010 theorizes the relationship between blackness and abjection by considering a literary scene of lynching in james weldon johnson's the autobiography of an ex coloured man 1912 in light of frantz fanon's discussions of how racialization specifically being interpellated into blackness powerfully disrupts a black person's experience of embodiment in ways both damaging and enabling the biracial narrator of johnson's novel confirms fanon's observations when he decides to reject the possibility of adopting a black identity for most of the novel the narrator struggles mostly unconsciously with both a racial and a sexual ambiguity that in some ways makes him a paradigmatic american subject both tortured and invigorated by the opportunity of creating an identity of his own choosing but when he witnesses a terrible lynching of a black man he decides to become ex colored in essence white the narrator's experience identifies a specific aspect of racialized trauma the trauma that he experiences is entirely bound up in his perception of the lynching as a collective injury indeed a collective annihilation his trauma lies in his intense imagination of connection to a race that could be so dealt with the lynching thus becomes a kind of primal scene for the narrator in which the violent and sexually violent elements of the relation between whiteness and blackness are revealed he looks directly at the construction of blackness but can only read it as humiliation and defeat so he abandons it and in so doing abandons an opportunity of self making of taking the reins of what fanon describes as sociogenic power which an acceptance of abject blackness would enable
