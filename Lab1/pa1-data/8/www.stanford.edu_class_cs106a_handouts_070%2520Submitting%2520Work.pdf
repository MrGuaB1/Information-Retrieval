submitting work page 1 cs106a winter 2011 2012 handout 07 january 11 2011 submitting work based on a handout by eric roberts and mehran sahami this handout provides a little more background on submitting work remember that all assignments are submitted electronically through eclipse whether an assignment is submitted on time is determined by the time we receive your electronic submission which is timestamped in the submission process that time is based on the time on the server that receives the assignment so it pays to submit things with a few minutes to spare particularly if you discover that your computer's clock is running slow submitting your assignments electronically the stanford version of eclipse makes submission a relatively painless process all you need to do is select the submit project entry under the stanford menu once you select this option eclipse will bring up a dialog box asking you for additional information here are the steps you should follow to submit your project 1 enter your sunet id and password and then click on the authenticate button 2 after you are authenticated click the next button 3 you should then select the assignment that you wish you submit by clicking on the assignment number to highlight it and again click the next button 4 you will then be asked for the project you are submitting at which point you can click the browse button which will bring up a list of the current projects open in eclipse you should select by clicking on the directory containing the project you wish to submit so it is highlighted then click the ok button 5 the name of your project should now appear in the box labeled project you can now click the finish button to submit your project it may take some time for your project to be fully submitted 6 once your project is submitted you will get a message message congratulating you on your successful submission click the ok button and you re done 7 optional if you want to see what files have been submitted you can view your submission on the paperless website http paperless stanford edu this will show you the files that your section leader will see when grading your submission 1 page 2 in many cases and particularly here in the case of assignment 1 the project file will contain the source files for all the problems so that a single submission is sufficient to deliver all the files you may however make new submissions by invoking the submit project mechanism additional times your section leader will receive only the most recent submission the project you submit must contain all the files necessary to run your program these files will typically be java files containing programs however particularly if you are extending the program say because you ve added some extra features in search of a or score you may also have some image files or audio clips that are part of the submission as well make a backup copy of your assignment although we work hard to keep track of all the assignments that come in the fact that cs 106a has so many students and such a large staff means that assignments have sometimes not been received as expected if your assignment goes missing you will need to resubmit to make resubmission possible you are responsible for keeping a backup copy of you work as a side note if you have a personal computer it is always a good idea to have back ups of the files on your hard drive for example you may want to back up your files on an external hard drive a zip thumb drive or use an on line storage service such as dropbox 2
