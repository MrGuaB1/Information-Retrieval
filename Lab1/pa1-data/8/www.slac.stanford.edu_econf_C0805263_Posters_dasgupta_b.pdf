collective three flavor oscillations of supernova neutrinos page 1 collective three flavor oscillations of supernova neutrinos basudeb dasgupta and amol dighe tata institute of fundamental research mumbai india abstract neutrinos of different energies can undergo flavor conversions collectively when their number densities are sufficiently large eg neutrinos emitted from a core collapse supernova a formalism that describes such collective phenomena in the three flavor framework is presented in this work it is shown that the flavor evolution may be factorized into well known two flavor transformations viz synchronized oscillations bipolar oscillations and spectral splits with hierarchical frequencies given by m2 sol and m2 atm application of these ideas to a typical supernova allows us to evaluate the emitted flavor fluxes these fluxes are significantly different from those contained in previous literature and predict interesting signals at large neutrino detectors eg mass hierarchy determination even at extremely small values of 13
