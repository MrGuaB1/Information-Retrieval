slac r 505 production rates of strange vector mesons at the z0 resonance slac slac pubs and reports slac r 505 production rates of strange vector mesons at the z 0 resonance abstract this dissertation presents a study of strange vector meson production leading particle effect and a first direct measuremeut of the strangeness suppression parameter in hadronic decays of the neutral electroweak boson z 0 the measurements were performed in e e collisious at the stanford linear accelerator center slac with the slc large detector sld experiment a uew generation particle id system the sld cerenkov ring imaging detector crid is used to discriminate kaons from pions enabling the reconstruction of the vector mesons over a wide momentum range the inclusive production rates of phi and k 0 and the differential rates versus momentum were measured and are compared with those of other experiments and theoretical predictions the high longitudinal polarisation of the slc electron beam is used in coujunction with the electroweak quark productiou asymmetries to separate quark jets from antiquark jets k 0 production is studied separately in these samples and the results show evidence for the leading particle effect the difference between k 0 production rates at high momentum in quark and antiquark jets yields a first direct measurement of strangeness suppression in jet fragmentation full text pdf slac r 505 9.58 mb compressed postscript not available for this document more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 12 jun 2006 16 04 pdt by htmlme pl
