slac pub 10685 wire measurement of impedance of an x band accelerating structure slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 10685 wire measurement of impedance of an x band accelerating structure abstract several tens of thousands of accelerator structures will be needed for the next generation of normal conducting linear colliders known as the glc nlc global linear collider next linear collider to prevent the beam being driven into a disruptive bbu beam break up mode or at the very least the emittance being significantly diluted it is important to damp down the wakefield left by driving bunches to a manageable level manufacturing errors and errors in design need to be measured and compared with prediction in this paper a bench top method of measuring transverse impedances in x band accelerating structures is described utilizing an off axis wire the s parameters are measured and converted to impedance measurements in a damped and detuned structure built for glc nlc are presented and the results are discussed full text pdf slac pub 10685 249 kb compressed postscript not available for this document more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 03 sep 2004 08 08 pdt by htmlme pl
