home page mycobacterium tuberculosis novel approaches to tb diagnosis home interferon gamma release assays interferon gamma release assays interferon gamma release assays are a class of assays for viral and infectious diseases that measure the cell mediated response in infected individuals through the levels of interferon gamma released during an infection t cells from the individual will be senstized via mhc proteins to the antigens presented by cells of the infecting organism t cells will thus be able to bind to foreign infecting cells releasing interferon gamma interferon gamma release assays take advantage of this natural process in infected immunocompetent individuals when antigens specific for a given infecting agent often in the form of purified protein derivatives are applied to whole blood samples from infected individuals t cells sensitized to the antigens will be present in the blood and will bind to the antigen the t cells will then release interferon gamma the presence of sensitized t cells in infected individuals will result in far higher levels of ifn g release than among uninfected individuals the presence of ifn g can then be quantified using a single step enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa using anti ifn g antibodies image from cellestis website http www cellestis com irm content compinfo pic_4_3pic1 gif quantiferon tb the original igra type assay originally approved for use by the fda in 2001 developed for use for tb diagnosis the test measures the release of ifn g when heparinized whole blood samples are incubated with purified protein derivative from m tuberculosis the test is no longer available for use cdc quantiferon tb gold the only new diagnostic approved by the fda 2004 the qft gold assay is slowly being implemented in the united states quantiferon gold in tube assay the newest development in igras the in tube assay is available for use in other countries but has yet to be approved by the fda
