untitled document dirofilaria immitis morphology and life cycle figure 11 male and female adult heartworm 16 female adult worms grow up to 10 12 inches in length while males are only 4 6 inches long with spirally coiled tails macrofilariae are white long and threadlike the vulva opening in a female is located behind the posterior end of the esophagus figure 12 life cycle of d immitis 14 adult male and female worms mate in the heart lungs or associated blood vessels female adults produce embryos with a thin vitelline membrane when the microfilariae are deposited into the chambers of the heart and the pulmonary artery the membrane is lost the microfilariae are carried in the dog's bloodstream through the lungs left chamber of the heart and into the circulatory system the microfilariae are ingested by nocturnal mosquitoes which feed on the dog's blood the microfilariae mature into infective larvae inside mosquito first in the intestine for 24 36 hours then intermediate development occurs in malpighian tubules for 9 days the second molt is in the abdominal hemacoel and larvae appear 10 20 days after entry into the mosquito third stage juveniles move to the mouth of the mosquito a minimum requirement of 14 c is necessary for larval development when the mosquito feeds again the mature larvae infect a new host if the host is suitable over the course of a few months the larvae mature into adult worms inside the host's body and releasing eggs after 6 7 months the worms become fully mature after 1 year and have a life span of 5 7 years
