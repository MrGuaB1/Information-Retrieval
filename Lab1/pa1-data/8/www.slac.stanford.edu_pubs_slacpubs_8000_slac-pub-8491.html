slac pub 8491 extension of mad version 8 to include beam acceleration slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8491 extension of mad version 8 to include beam acceleration abstract in this paper we describe modifications to mad version 8.23 to include linear accelerator cavities and beam acceleration an additional energy variable has been added which is modified as the beam passes through lcav elements linear accelerator cavities and can be used as a constraint in matching commands the calculation of the beta functions and phase advance is consistent with that in other codes that treat acceleration such as transport or dimad these modifications allow this version of mad to be used for the design and modeling of linacs and we present examples from the next linear collider design as well as a muon acceleration complex the code is available from cern or slac full text pdf slac pub 8491 316 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8491 178 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
