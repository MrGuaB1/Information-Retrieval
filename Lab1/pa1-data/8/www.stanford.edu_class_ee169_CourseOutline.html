ee169 home course info course outline instructor materials assignments lecture notes solutions exams midterm final project course outline overview the course starts with an introduction to multidimensional fourier transforms it then goes into four different types of imaging systems each of these sections is two weeks the first week is a description of the physics and geometry of a typical system that uses that imaging mechanism the second week examines a specific signal processing problem that arises with that modality matlab experiments will involve implementing these algorithms on real and simulated data outline section 0 multidimensional fourier transforms week 1 introduction to the course review of 1d fourier transforms introduction to multidimensional fourier transforms week 2 2d and 3d fourier transforms sampling in multiple dimensions section 1 projection imaging systems week 3 physics and geometry of projection x ray imaging week 4 image quality metrics snr cnr impulse response mtf noise characteristics matlab measuring snr cnr and mtf in numerical phantoms section 2 backprojection imaging systems week 5 physics and geometry of x ray ct description of pet and spect week 6 backprojection reconstruction algorithms and geometries matlab implement either convolution backprojection or fourier interpolation reconstruction section 3 beam forming imaging systems week 7 physics of ultrasound imaging systems common imaging geometries week 8 beam forming with ultrasound transducer arrays dynamic focus on transmit and receive matlab implement dynamic focus on receive using ultrasound data section 4 fourier encoding systems week 9 physics and geometry of mri systems week 10 reconstruction of mri images either fourier interpolation or reconstruction from partial data matlab implement partial k space reconstruction using mr data page generated 2010 09 28 23 57 36 pdt by jemdoc
