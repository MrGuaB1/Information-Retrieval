information networks page 1 information networks ms&e 337 cme 337 course description information networks such as the internet world wide web or social networks can be characterized by heterogeneity and independence of their building blocks nodes and the complex underlying link structure between them this course tries to survey the mathematical results developed in the last few years on algorithms for analyzing such networks and models that capture their basic properties the course pre requisites include an advanced undergrad class similar to cs161 or a graduate course similar to cme 305 on graphs and algorithms it will also require familiarity with probability and linear algebra administrative information instructor amin saberi email saberi stanford edu cell 650 704 7857 time and place tuesdays 2 15 4 30 education 313 the course will consist of 10 2 hour lectures on advanced topics in graph theory and algorithms with applications on information networks there will be a number of guest lectures topics random graph models erdos renyi random graphs cluster growth formation of the giant connected component diameter and distance distribution scale free graphs random graphs with a fixed degree distribution preferential attachment model and polya urns algorithmic aspects expansion eigenvalue gap and their algorithmic implications spectrum of random and scale free graphs random walks and propagation of viruses spectral clustering and applications in data mining decentralized search and small world properties small world effects in online datasets decentralized search in structured and unstructured networks case studies www graph structure in the www searching the web pagerank hits etc internet the internet at the router and autonomous systems level social networks online social networks contagion and cascading behavior in a social network
