survey and alignment design of nsrl based on laser tracker page 1 xiaoye he qitie chen nsrl university of science and technology of china page 2 overview introduction the alignment of nsrl survey and alignment based on laser tracker complement of the design page 3 introduction the alignment of nsrl 1980s construction control network 1987 installation control network 1990s the control network for monitoring the deformation page 4 installation control network page 5 network for monitoring deformation page 6 laser tracker the equipments inside the ring need laser tracker leica page 7 addition on the dipole magnet page 8 purpose of the addition benchmark points need as separate as possible in order to control the coordinates of points grind a regional on the top of dipole magnet to control the level page 9 measured points page 10 points request there is no request for these points with its location but requires stability internal the ring and on the wall around the ring the number of points must enough page 11 laser tracker survey network page 12 transfer station transfer station survey agency points not less than 6 points transfer station 8 times need more points page 13 laser tracker survey network page 14 necessary complement the addition of the points will not attain the purpose the equipments inside the ring will disturb the measurement the result of the transfer station will not so good all of these should be considered in fact the alignment needs different instruments to measure the same control network page 15 thank you for your attention
