thank you very much for your constant support in the past year juwen wang page 1 for our structure people 2001 is an another great year in theoretical and design studies fabrication and experiments the following facts simply showed the gratifying achievement which can only be realized by the joint efforts from every one of us in this year we completed 2 final assemblies for t20vg5n and t105vg5n for march 01 test in this year we successfully built 8 structure assemblies t53vg5r t53vg3r sw20pir x 2 sw20pil x 2 t53vg3ra t53vg3f for august 01 high power testing we have been working on 4 structures h60vg3r h90vg3r sw20a565 x 2 for march 02 test now we are near the completion of new coupler designs of all structures for june 02 test we have started the design studies on high phase advance dds structures and detuned sw structures we are preparing experiments in structure measurements such as the wire bench test thank you very much for your constant support in the past year juwen wang
