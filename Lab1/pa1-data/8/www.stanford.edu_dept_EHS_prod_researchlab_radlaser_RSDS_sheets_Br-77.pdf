safety sheet nuclide br 77 page 1 radionuclide safety data sheet nuclide br 77 forms soluble physical characteristics half life 56 hours type decay ec beta maximum energy 0.343 mev 73 98 photon radiations of different energies are emitted the average energy of photons is 428 mev and the average intensity is 83 percent hazard category c level low hazard 0.01 to 1 mci b level moderate hazard 1 mci to 100 mci a level high hazard 100 mci external radiation hazards and shielding the hazard from the positrons is very small because of the low intensity the principal hazard is from the gamma rays the exposure rate from the gamma rays is approximately 5.9 r cm2 mci hr the exposure rate at 1 cm from 1 mci is 5900 mr hr an estimate of the second tenth value of lead for shielding this nuclide may be approximated by considering the 52 mev photons eg approximately 1.3 cm the first mm of pb shielding will reduce the radiation by a much larger value because of low energy x rays hazards if internally deposited the annual limit of intake which will result in a whole body exposure of 500 mrem is 1600 microcuries dosimetry and bioassay requirements film badges and dosimeter rings are appropriate for monitoring br77 exposure from 1 or more millicuries special problems and precautions 1 always wear protective gloves to keep contamination from skin change gloves often 2 gm survey meters should be used to verify exposure rates in areas where br77 is handled or stored 3 the c level of br77 which is based upon table 3.1 in the radiation protection manual is unduly conservative 0.1 10 microcuries due to the fact it is not a listed substance for survey purposes use the low hazard level above as the c level quantity 4 limit of soluble waste to sewer to 10 microcuries day per lab 10 87
