slac pub 8935 sources of beam halo in the next linear collider main linac slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8935 sources of beam halo in the next linear collider main linac abstract one of the factors that limited the performance of the stanford linear collider slc was the number of particles per bunch with large betatron or energy amplitudes we consider the equivalent problem for the next linear collider nlc main x band linacs we evaluate the number of large amplitude particles which can be expected due to scattering processes wakefields and magnet nonlinearities we conclude that the number of particles in the beam halo from these sources can easily be accomodated by the planned post linac collimation system full text pdf slac pub 8935 299 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8935 133 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 07 aug 2001 11 20 pdt by htmlme pl
