high precision neutrino scattering at energies of order 100 gev offers a clean probe of beyond standard model physics at the te page 1 high precision neutrino scattering at energies of order 100 gev offers a clean probe of beyond standard model physics at the terascale nusong neutrino scattering on glass is a high statistics neutrino experiment which has been developed under that principle and has been proposed to run at the fermilab tevatron in year 2015 one of its strongest features is that it offers a unique opportunity for direct searches for new physics at tev scale energies providing information complementary to that of the lhc nusong is sensitive to an unmatchable spectrum of new physics from new light neutrino properties to new interactions manifested through rare events to new particles such as light neutrissimos light vector bosons etc a particular example which illustrates the experiment's discovery potential is the search for evidence of matrix freedom or non unitarity in the neutrino sector non unitarity can manifest itself in a number of ways such as flavor dependent neutrino couplings or instantaneous flavor transitions both of which would cause observable effects at nusong this poster presents these examples thus highlighting the truly rich discovery potential of the experiment
