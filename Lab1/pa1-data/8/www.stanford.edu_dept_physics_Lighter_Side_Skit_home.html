stanford physics christmas skit electronic playbill the 1994 christmas skit for the department of physics at leland stanford junior university here it is the world's first electronic playbill it has all the advantages of the net it's raw disorganized and in the end it ain t much but hey it's free contents the script a lot of people asked for the script to the skit i have placed my copy on the web but be warned that this was a free form collaboration and none of us stuck exactly to our written lines the props where feasible some of the props were textual information so i put those on line note looking at the props will give away some of the plot read the script first the obligatory production notes every time i see a student theatre group do a show the playbill includes a statement of inflated importance by the director or producer since we didn t have either i seized the chance to write my own a list of credits in case you d like to shower your adulation on the actors you can find their names here note the effect is heightened if you read the script before you look at the cast of characters the electronic playbill is a creation of bernard hp gilroy gilroy leland stanford edu contact him with your comments
