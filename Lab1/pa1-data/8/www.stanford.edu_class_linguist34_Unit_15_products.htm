the language of advertising product placement unit 15 dynamic organization of images product placement advertisers traditionally place elements on the page based on two observations on the way the eye reads a page because we read from left to right layouts tend to focus on the upper left corner where the eye starts and the lower right corner where the eye finishes reading many advertisements place the product or logo in the lower right corner hoping that placing the product at the last area the eye reads will create a lasting impression other traditional advertisements place emphasis on the optical center or the area upon which the eye tends to naturally focus this area is about one third from the top of the page and one third from the left edge for more information on product placement refer to v&s 44 46 this page still needs work peter product size kress and van leeuwen notice that the proximity of the camera to its subject reflects a particular social relation between the photographer and the viewer of the photograph and the photographed see unit 12 the closer an object is to the camera the more intimate and interactive the social relationship becomes at close distance we would suggest the object is shown as if the viewer is engaged with it unless the object is very small it is shown only in part and often the picture includes the user's hand or a tool at middle distance the object is shown in full but without much space around it it is common in advertising the advertised product is shown in full but from a fairly close range and a steep angle as if the viewer stands just in front of the table on which it is displayed at long distance there is an invisible barrier between the viewer and the object the object is there for contemplation only out of reach kress and van leeuwen 134 references kress gunther and theo van leeuwen 1996 reading images the grammar of visual design london routledge p 134 home
