last revised 6 i4 20 i page 1 greek archaeology general exam reading list autumn 2011 last revised 6 i4 20 i general 1 james whitley the archaeology of ancient greece 2001 much the best overall survey good balance of data and interpretation arranged chronologically 2 christopher mee greek archaeology 2011 briefer than whitley but more up to date arranged thematically i recommend reading this after whitley whitley gives you the big story but mee is better for understanding the categories of evidence 3 john pedley greek art and archaeology 2nd ed 1998 both whitley and mee are very archaeological in the sense that they approach the field like archaeologists who work in the rest of the world rather than treating it as the study of hi gh end art whitley has a certain amount on high art but to make sure you have a grasp of the traditional categories which remains the backbone of traditional undergraduate survey courses you should read pedley too history of the field 4 steve dyson in pursuit of ancient pasts 2006 reliable overview of the field's development periods 5 cynthia shelmerdine ed the cambridge companion to the aegean bronze age 2008 i generally don t like to assign these companion type books which can be very bitty and uneven but this one's pretty good and there really isn ta good single author rival eric cline's edited oxford handbook of the aegean bronze age 2010 is also good but bittier with more little entries it doesn t really matter which of the two you use though 6 oliver dickinson the aegean from bronze age to iron age 2006 i don t really like this book which i find strangely organized and very dull but it's the most up to date general survey 7 anthony snodgrass archaic greece 1980 outstanding survey although now more than 30 years old i would immodestly suggest that you read my paper the eighth century revolution in kurt raaflaub and hans van wees eds a companion to archaic greece 2009 pp 64 80 along with snodgrass chapters 1 and 2 8 jerome pollitt art and experience in classical greece 1972 badly out of date but still the best read with good use of the texts and very insightful 9 susan alcock graecia capra 1993 excellent account of hellenistic roman changes categories of data page 2 10 on sanctuaries mary emerson greek sanctuaries 2007 is a good no nonsense overview tony spawforth's the complete greek temples 2006 is also really good as a quick reference work with all the basic facts although its focus is a bit narrower ll on settlements lisa nevett domestic space in classical antiquity 2010 is a good brief overview 12 on cemeteries you might try ian morris death ritual and social structure in classical antiquity 1992 lt's not a very systematic coverage and is now aging like the author but so far as i know no one's been tempted to produce a newer and better overview
