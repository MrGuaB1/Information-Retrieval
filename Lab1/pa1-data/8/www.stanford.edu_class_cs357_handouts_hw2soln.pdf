homework 2 solutions page 1 homework 2 solutions 1 prove the following algebraic properties a g f g f g let us consider any point x in the domain of f and g let x0 be the closest point to x such that g x0 now there are two possible cases g x 1 in this case x0 x so f g x0 f x0 hence g x0 f g x0 f x0 g x0 g x 0 in this case g x0 f g x0 0 f x0 g x0 the identity holds in both cases b f g h f h g h in fact distributes over all boolean operators let x be any point in the input space let x0 be the closest point to x in h thus lhs f g h x f g x0 f x0 g x0 the rhs f h g h x f h x g h x f x0 g x0 which matches lhs hence the identity holds essentially the same proof can be used to show that distributes over other boolean operators 2 shannon decomposition works with generalized cofactor as well as cofactoring on a single variable in other words f ite g f g f g g f g g f g prove it from the previous problem we know g f g f g similarly g f g f g thus rhs of the identity we are interested in proving is equivalent to f g f g which by demorgan's law equals f 3 find two functions f and g where the bdd for f g is bigger than the bdd for f the idea is to choose a function f for which there is a lot of subgraph sharing and then let constrain destroy some of the sharing consider the family of functions fn x1 xn and cn x1 xn the variable order is irrelevant because of symmetry for plain bdds fn has 2n 1 nodes including the terminal nodes whereas fn cn has 3n 2 nodes for bdds with complement edges fn had n 1 nodes whereas fn cn has 2n 1 nodes in either case the bdd size increases after the constrain operation 4 sat with bdds with and without constrain results for all students bdds without constrain were almost completely useless the method using constrain could solve a few problems especially when students added more optimizations but in all cases it was much worse than a modern sat solver i did not expect bdds to be competitive but results were worse than i expected 1
