neutrinos oscilation page 1 analytical treatment of matter effect on oscillations of low and high energy neutrinos jc d olivo g medina tanco and d supanitsky dep altas energias inst de ciencias nucleares universidad nacional autonoma de mexico mexico df cp 04510 we derive an analytical description of neutrino oscillations in matter based on the magnus exponential representation of the time evolution operator our approach is valid in a wide range of the neutrino energies and properly accounts for the modifications that the respective probability transitions suffer when neutrinos from different sources go across the earth the present approximation considerably improves over other perturbative treatments existing in the current literature furthermore the analytical expressions derive inside the magnus framework are remarkably simple which facilitate their practical use when applied to the calculation of the day night asymmetry in the solar neutrino flux our result reproduces the numerical calculation with an accuracy better than 1 for the first lowest order approximation when the approximation is improved by the second order correction the accuracy of the methods better than 5 even for neutrino energies as large as 100 mev in the gev regime characteristic of atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos this accuracy is complemented by a good reproduction of the position of the maxima in the flavor transition probabilities
