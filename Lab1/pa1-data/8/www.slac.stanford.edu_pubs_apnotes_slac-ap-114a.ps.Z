drifting of closed orbit in the high energy ring page 1 slac ap 114 december 1998 drifting of closed orbit in the high energy ring yunhai cai martin lee and uli wienands stanford linear accelerator center stanford university stanford ca 94309 abstract since the beginning of this commissioning period november december 1998 the closed orbit drift of a few millimeters in both horizontal and vertical planes in the high energy ring her has been observed because optics coupling and beam size in the ring depend on the closed orbit the drifting of the orbit makes systematic improvement of the machine very di cult if not impossible it is very di cult to keep any experiments repeatable which is crucial for studying the instabilities in the machine in this note we will present some initial measurements and analysis of the problem work supported by the department of energy under contract no de ac03 76sf00515
