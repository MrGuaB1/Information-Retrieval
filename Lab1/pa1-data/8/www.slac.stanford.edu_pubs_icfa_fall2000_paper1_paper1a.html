iib fall 2000 paper no 1 richard wigmans thin calorimetry for cosmic ray studies outside the earth's atmosphere full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract cosmic ray experiments outside the earth's atmosphere are subject to severe restrictions on the mass of the instruments therefore it is important that the experimental information that can be obtained per unit detector mass is maximized in this paper tests are described of a thin 1.4 lambda_int deep hadron calorimeter that was designed with this goal in mind this detector was equipped with two independent active media which provided complementary information on the showering hadrons it is shown that by combining the information from these media it was possible to reduce the effects of the dominant leakage fluctuations on the calorimeter performance last modified 14 nov 2000 jochen
