we suggest a perturbative approach for generic choices for the universe equation of state and introduce a novel framework for st page 1 we suggest a perturbative approach for generic choices for the universe equation of state and introduce a novel framework for studying mass varying neutrinos mavan's coupled to the dark sector for concreteness we examine the coupling between neutrinos and the underlying scalar field associated with the generalized chaplygin gas gcg a unification model for dark energy and dark matter it is shown that the application of a perturbative approach to mavan mechanisms translates into a constraint on the coefficient of a linear perturbation which depends on the ratio between a neutrino energy dependent term and scalar field potential terms we quantify the effects on the mavan sector by considering neutrino masses generated by the seesaw mechanism after setting the gcg parameters in agreement with general cosmological constraints we find that the squared speed of sound in the neutrino scalar gcg fluid is naturally positive in this scenario the model stability depends on previously set up parameters associated with the equation of state of the universe our results suggest that the gcg is a particularly suitable candidate for constructing a stable mavan scenario
