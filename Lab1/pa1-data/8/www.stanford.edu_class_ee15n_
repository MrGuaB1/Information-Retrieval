ee15n the art and science of engineering design ee15n the art and science of engineering product design winter 2011 professor andrea goldsmith professor my t le the goal of this seminar is to introduce freshmen to the design process of an engineering project the seminar will consist of a series of lectures the first part of each lecture will focus on the different design aspects of an engineering project including formation of the design team developing a project statement generating design ideas and specifications finalizing the design and reporting the outcome students will form teams to follow these procedures in designing a term project of their choice over the quarter the second part of each lecture will consist of outside speakers including founders of some of the top companies in silicon valley who will share their experiences about engineering design an on site visit to ideo ideo com will also be part of the course ideo provides design services to high tech companies to bring the products services spaces and interactive experiences these companies envision to life the seminar serves three purposes 1 it introduces students to the design process of turning an idea into a final design 2 it presents the different functions that people play in a project and 3 it gives students a chance to consider what role in a project would be best suited to their interests and skills basic course information class time and location w 3 00 5 05 460 334 linguistics building on front of main quad note axess lists an earlier start time 2 15 and this is not the original room instructors andrea goldsmith packard 371 andrea ee 5 6932 office hours w 2 3pm and by appointment my t le drmytle gmail com 650 224 1352 ohs tbd and by appt administrator pat oshiro poshiro stanford 365 packard 3 3164 required textbook engineering design a project based introduction 3rd editiion by clive dym and patrick little grading class participation 20 assignments 20 project 60 assignments and deadlines required reading project based assignments writing assignments your first writing assignment is due 2 9 announcements first class meets wednesday jan 5 at 3pm in 460 334 we will try to accommodate everyone who wants to take the class so please come to the first meeting even if you are on the waiting list or didn t sign up at all class location has been moved to educ201 cubberly education building writing assignments there are two writing assignments one due 2 9 and one due 3 9 which are chosen from the following options a report on how society shapes technology or vice versa eg stem cell research cell phones nuclear power the internet space travel a case study of a complex engineering project eg the ipod iphone facebook the space shuttle mris hybrid cars describe in more detail an engineering project executed by one of our guest speakers chose your own topic related to engineering project design projects students will form teams during the first two weeks of class for the term project details will be provided shortly projects from 2008 headphones for students report presentation medical clinic for flood prone area report presentation lectures lecture 1 1 5 introduction to engineering design lecture slides ppt required reading text chapter 1 guest lecture jim fruchterman benetech lecture 2 1 12 the design process lecture slides ppt required reading text chapters 2 and 10 guest lecture stephanie hannon google lecture 3 1 19 defining the engineering problem lecture slides ppt required reading text chapter 3 guest lecture adam thompson & evelyn castle ehealth nigeria lecture 4 1 26 functions and requirements lecture slides ppt required reading text chapter 4 guest panel on being and engineer eve schooler intel karin meyer intuit kevin jones greenplug lecture 5 2 2 generating and evaluating design ideas lecture slides ppt required reading text chapter 5 and 11 guest lecture divya ramachandran uc berkeley lecture 6 2 9 models and prototypes lecture slides ppt required reading text 6.1 6.3 7.1 7.2 posted articles guest lecture jeff karras levensohn venture partners lecture 7 2 16 why things fail lecture slides ppt required reading new york times article on the gulf of mexico oil spill national commission on the bp deepwater horizon oil spill and offshore drilling chapter of final findings guest lecture judy estrin jlabs lecture 8 2 23 communicating the design outcome lecture slides ppt required reading text chapter 6 guest lecture eric case rdio lecture 9 3 2 wrapping up and looking ahead required reading wikipedia article on technology roadmaps ehow article on technoly roadmaps brighthub article on the iphone evolution including specifications for each generation wikipedia article on the history of the iphone guest lecture steve rummage davis wright tremaine llp lecture 10 3 9 field trip to ideo march 14 12 15 3 15pm presentation and final report
