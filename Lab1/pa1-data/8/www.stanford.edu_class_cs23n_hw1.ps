cs 23n winter 2004 homework 1 controlling a servo page 1 cs23n homework 1 1 cs 23n winter 2004 homework 1 controlling a servo handout 3 due in class on wednesday april 14 materials for this problem can be picked up from the lab b38 however you must form a team and email cs23n instructors cs stanford edu with your list of team members 4 5 students before getting the materials and starting work using the supplied bread board microcontroller and other materials construct a circuit to control a single servo using a pololu servo controller psc you can download a manual for the psc at http www pololu com products pololu 0290 ssc02a guide pdf your controller should move a servo to approximately 0 pause 90 pause 0 pause 90 pause and repeat the cycle from the beginning your circuit should use nice connectors made with crimped pins and connector housings for connecting the power supplies and serial line to the psc have a single power switch which simultaneously turns on off both the microcontroller and the psc's electronics a separate power supply for the servos on the psc no power switch necessary after completing the problem above you may also wish to experiment with the following optional extensions 1 easy add three leds to your circuit and have one of the leds lit at each instant to indicate whether the servo is currently commanded to go to 90 0 or 90 2 easy add a pushbutton to your circuit so that pushing down and releasing the button causes your microcontroller to be reset the easiest way to do this is by having the push button connect pin 4 of the microcontroller to ground when it is pressed down however be careful not to create a short circuit 3 intermediate following the instructions on the printout in the lab modify a servo for continuous rotation instead of going to the three pre set positions your servo should now rotate continuously in one direction stop and pause rotate continuously in the other direction stop and pause and repeat 4 challenging figure out how to make your microcontroller accept inputs add a potential meter to your circuit so that by turning the screw on the pontentialmeter we can control the length of the pauses between the different positions 90 0 90 the servo moves to 5 challenging you probably used a delay loop such as a for loop to implement the pauses this is computationally inefficient if the processor can be fruitfully used for other compu tations in the background figure out how to use interrupts on the microcontroller and rewrite your code using timer driven interrupts in addition to the suggested extensions above you should feel encouraged to explore other changes improvements to the circuit and tell us what you did
