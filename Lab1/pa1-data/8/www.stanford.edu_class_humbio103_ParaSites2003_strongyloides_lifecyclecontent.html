life cycle life cycle strongyloides stercoralis has a very unique and complex life cycle it alternates between free living and parasitic cycles and has the potential to cause autoinfection and multiply within the host a characteristic other nematodes do not possess source http dpd cdc gov dpdx html strongyloidiasis htm from the large intestine rhabditiform larvae are excreted in the stool the rhabditiform larvae either develop into free living adult males and females or they undergo direct development to become infective filariform larvae free living adult worms mate and females produce fertilized embryonated eggs rhabditiform larvae hatch from these eggs and either develop into filariform larvae or into another generation of free living adults source http www courses ahc umn edu medical school idis images strongyloides_life_cycle gif the parasitic cycle begins when the filariform larvae penetrate the human host skin the circulatory system allows the larvae to travel to the lungs and penetrate the alveolar spaces next they are transported to the pharynx eventually swallowed and reach the small intestine in the small intestine the larvae molt twice to become adult female worms these female worms produce eggs that become deposited in the intestinal mucosa once they hatch the new rhabditiform larvae travel to the lumen from there they are either passed in the stool or cause autoinfection source http www bbc co uk gardening children images worms_worms_head gif in autoinfection rhabditiform larvae develop into filariform larvae which may penetrate the intestinal mucosa internal autoinfection or may penetrate the skin of the perianal area external autoinfection in both cases after subsequent penetration the larvae follow the normal life cycle again heading to the lungs and eventually the small intestine
