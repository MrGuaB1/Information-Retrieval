fortran 90 tutorial 3 how to use fortran 90 on the unix computers at stanford practical details unfortunately the fortran 90 compiler that resides on the sun computers in the leland system is unreliable however there is no alternative at this time if you think you re program should compile but it won t then it might not be your fault see the instructor if you think the compiler is misbehaving compiling linking and executing in virtually the same manner in which we compiled our fortran 77 routines we can process our fortran 90 programs to compile and link a fortran 90 source code with the name main f90 simply type f90 main f90 this will create an executable file called a out fortran 90 programs which make use of the free format form to be explained in the next section must have an extension f90 just as with the fortran 77 compiler we are able to specify the name of our executable file with the fortran90 compiler by specifying the o option f90 main f90 o main out this will create an executable file called main out similarly we can link to a fortran 90 compiled library such as the blas lapack library in the class account by f90 main f90 l usr class me390 lib lmy_lib90 this will link your program main f90 to the compiled library called libmy_lib90 a which resides on the class account in the directory usr class me390 lib you may copy this library file to your own account if you wish however the file is rather large and may cause you to exceed your disk quota on the leland system a better approach would be to simply compile your programs requiring the blas lapack library using the command given above note the library libmy_lib90 a must have been created using the fortran 90 compiler attempts to link a fortran 90 program to a fortran 77 library will fail copyright 1996 7 by stanford university all rights reserved
