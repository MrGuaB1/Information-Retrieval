untitled document morphology trophozoites are amorphous and range from 20 40um in diameter and contain one nucleus they use a well defined pseudopodium for their rapid gliding locomotion this pseudopodium is often extended greatly such that there is no conspicuous differentiation between ecto and endoplasm 4 it was originally thought to lack mitochondria but recent evidence of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes and a remnant organelle proves otherwise other unique features of the entamoeba include polyploidy chromosomes that are of various lengths multiple origins of dna replication abundant repetitive dna closely spaced genes that largely lack introns a new gaac element controlling the expression of messenger rna and unique endocytic pathways 3 these amoebas are often seen with ingested red blood cells leukocytes or bacteria the ribosomes are arranged in helices that form chormatoid bodies the nucleus is vesicular spherical and ranges from 4 to 7 um in diameter 4 it contains a membrane lined with small chromatin granules as well as a small central spherical karyosome 14 23 left trophozoite right cyst the cysts are spherical and generally smaller than the trophozoites 10 to 16 um in diameter when mature they have four nuclei and these nuclei have morphology similar to those of the trophozoites 4 22 e histolytica cysts a line drawing b c wet mounts stained with iodine d permanent preparation stained with trichome
