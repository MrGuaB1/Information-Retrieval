bounding a definite integral find numbers l and h such that l 3 1 x dx h the idea is to find numbers m and m su page 1 bounding a definite integral find numbers l and h such that l 3 0.5 1 x dx h the idea is to find numbers m and m such that m 1 x m when x is in 0.5 3 and then use property 8 in page 352 of the textbook good choices for m and m are the global minimum and the global maximum of f x 1 x on the interval 0.5 3 so we need to solve this optimization problem in this case this optimization problem is easy because f x is decreasing on 0.5 3 we know this because we know the graph of f x but we could also realize by taking the derivative f x 1 x2 which is always negative therefore the global maximum is f 0.5 2 and the global minimum is f 3 1 3 so 1 3 1 x 2 for all x in 0.5 3 now using the property 1 3 2.5 3 0.5 1 x dx 2 2.5 so we can pick l 2.5 3 and h 5 in general if the function is not increasing or decreasing it would require solving an optimization problem using the closed interval method for example try to do the same problem for 5 0 x3 12x 15 dx 1
