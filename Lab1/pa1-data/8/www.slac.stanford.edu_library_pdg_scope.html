online particle physics information scope slac online particle physics information pdg scope of this guide while a substantial amount of particle physics information is internet accessible most listings do not provide descriptions of a resource's scope and content making it difficult for searchers to know which source to use for a specific information need this compilation lists the main information sources with brief annotations and web addresses a resource is excluded if it provides information primarily of interest to only one institution in some cases multiple databases covering much the same material have been included with the assumption that users will make subsequent choices based on internet speeds search system interfaces or differences in scope presentation and coverage resources that provide information covering physics broadly have been included only if they have a significant and somewhat unique set of information useful to particle physics with such broader resources the annotation attempts to highlight the parts which specifically relate to particle physics accelerator physics resources have been excluded because they are covered well by the world wide web virtual library of beam physics and accelerator technology credits my thanks to piotr zyla particle data group pat kreitz travis brooks lesley wolf and nicole thomas slac library and the many particle physics web site and database maintainers who have all given me their generous assistance please send comments and corrections by e mail to wheeler slac stanford edu previous section main page pdg slac library slac owner a wheeler
