slac pub 8605 single pulse damage in copper slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8605 single pulse damage in copper abstract the next linear collider nlc 1 electron and positron beams are capable of damaging the linac accelerating structure and beamline vacuum chambers during a single accelerator pulse machine protection system mps considerations have an impact on the engineering and design of most machine components downstream of the damping ring injector complex beam tests have been done at the slac final focus test beam fftb 2 to examine the behavior of copper at and above the damage stress threshold in this paper we present results of damage studies in copper as the beam pulse heating is varied from below melting to near vaporization the goal of the tests was to determine allowable limits on beam size and intensity of a benign single bunch pilot beam to be used in testing linac systems typical expected pilot beam parameters compared with nominal are 10 times reduced intensity 10 times increased horizontal emittance and 1000 times increased vertical emittance resulting in a reduction in charge density of 10 5 the tests we report here used short 1 mm beam pulses of between i 3 x 10 9 and 20 x 10 9 electrons with transverse sizes sigma xy between 45 mu m 2 and 200 mu m 2 full text pdf slac pub 8605 671 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8605 76.5 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
