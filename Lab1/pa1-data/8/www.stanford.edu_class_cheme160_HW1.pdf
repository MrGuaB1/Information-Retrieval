chemical engineering 160 260 professor cw frank problem set 1 the first problem set will consist of the following problems fr page 1 chemical engineering 160 260 professor cw frank problem set 1 the first problem set will consist of the following problems from sperling 2nd ed ch 1 2 3 ch 2 1 3 ch 3 8 10 12 15 16 20 the problem set will be due monday january 29 in class i selected the problems in ch 1 to emphasize the fact that whereas i do not intend to dwell on the organic chemistry in our class i do want you to be able to recognize common polymers in this context you should study appendix 1.1 i selected the problems in ch 2 to force you to put chemical structures in place of the generic beads that i used in class for the stereoregular structures the size of the substituent group will have a significant effect on crystallization phenomena to be considered later in the course the head to head and head to tail question is of lesser overall importance but it still should force you to think about intramolecular interactions all of the problems that i selected in ch 3 are directed at some aspect of molecular weight and size determination these techniques are all based on dilute solution measurements to set the stage for these sperling includes a section on the thermodynamics of mixtures sections 3.2 and 3.3 you should read these but i will not discuss them in class until we cover polymer blends later in the course the problems selected from ch 3 cover the most important dilute solution methods osmotic pressure light scattering and intrinsic viscosity you should be very comfortable using these techniques to evaluate polymer molecular weight coil size and thermodynamic interaction with the solvent
