the low energy neutrino factory page 1 the low energy neutrino factory alan bross malcolm ellis steve geer olga mena and silvia pascoli to date most studies of neutrino factories have focused on facilities where the energy of the muon in the storage ring has been in the range of 25 50 gev in this paper we present a concept for a low energy 4 gev neutrino factory for baselines of o 1000 km the rich oscillation pattern at low neutrino interaction energy 0.5 3 gev provides the unique performance of this facility with regard to its sensitivity to cp violation and the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy a unique neutrino detector is needed however in order to exploit this oscillation pattern we will describe the basic accelerator facility demonstrate the methodology of the analysis and give an estimate on how well the low energy neutrino factory can measure 13 cp violation and the mass hierarchy we will also describe the detector concept that is used show a preliminary analysis regarding its performance and indicate what r&d is still needed finally we will show how the low energy neutrino factory could be a step towards an energy frontier muon collider
