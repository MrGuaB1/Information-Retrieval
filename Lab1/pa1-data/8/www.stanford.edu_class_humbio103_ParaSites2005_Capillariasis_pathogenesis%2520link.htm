untitled document pathogenesis the symptoms commonly observed in patients infected with capillariasis philippinensis result from the progressive damage to the intestinal epithelium and submucosa caused by the adult worms which continually traverse and burrow into the intestinal mucosa careful examination of the intestine reveals a reduction in the thickness of the intestinal mucosa flattening or complete destruction of the intestinal villi deepening of the crypts of liberkuhn and localized inflammation this mechanical erosion of the small intestine is responsible for the physiological changes associated with capillariasis philippinensis infection these changes include generalized malabsorption hypoproteinemia low blood calcium low potassium and hypocholesterolemia in contrast with many other parasitic infections pronounced eosinophilia does not consistently accompany intestinal capillariasis
