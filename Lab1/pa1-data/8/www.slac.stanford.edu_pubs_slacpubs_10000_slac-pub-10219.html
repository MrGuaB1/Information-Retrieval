slac pub 10219 novel accelerator structure couplers slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 10219 novel accelerator structure couplers abstract recent experience with x band accelerator structure development has shown the rf input coupler to be the region most prone to rf breakdown and degradation effectively limiting the operating gradient a major factor in this appears to be high magnetic fields at the sharp edges of the coupling irises as a first response to this problem couplers with rounded and thickened iris horns have been employed with improved performance in addition conceptually new coupler designs have been developed in which power is coupled through the broadwall of the feed waveguide a prototype mode converter coupler which launches the tm01 mode in circular waveguide before coupling through a matching cell into the main structure has been tested with great success with peak surface fields below those in the body of the structure this coupler represents a break through in the nlc structure program the design of this coupler and of variations which use beamline space more efficiently are described here the latter include a coupler in which power passes directly through an iris in the broad wall of the rectangular waveguide into a matching cell and one which makes the waveguide itself an accelerating cell we also discuss techniques for matching such couplers full text pdf slac pub 10219 244 kb compressed postscript slac pub 10219 305 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 26 mar 2004 08 53 pst by htmlme pl
