the deep sea acoustic detection system amadeus page 1 the deep sea acoustic detection system amadeus christopher lindsay naumann1 2 for the antares collaboration 1 cea saclay dsm irfu service de physique des particules france 2 formerly physikalisches institut 4 university of erlangen germany as a part of the antares neutrino telescope the amadeus antares modules for acoustic detection under the sea system is an array of acoustical sensors designed to investigate the possibilities of acoustic detection of ultrahigh energy neutrinos in the deep sea the complete system will comprise a total of 36 acoustic sensors in six clusters on two of the antares detector lines with an intersensor spacing of about one metre inside the clusters and between 15 and 340 metres between the different clusters it will cover a wide range of distances as will as provide a considerable lever arm for point source triangulation three of these clusters have already been deployed in 2007 and have been in operation since currently yielding around 2gb of acoustic data per day the remaining three clusters are scheduled to be deployed in may 2008 together with the final antares detector line apart from proving the feasibility of operating an acoustic detection system in the deep sea the main aim of this project is an indepth survey of both the acoustic properties of the sea water and the acoustic background present at the detector site it will also serve as a platform for the development and refinement of triggering filtering and reconstruction algorithms for acoustic particle detection in this presentation a description of the acoustic sensor and readout system is given together with examples for the reconstruction and evaluation of the acoustic data
