iib fall 2001 paper no 2 p fonte applications and new developments in resistive plate chambers full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract resistive plate chambers are rugged and affordable gas detectors that have found extensive use in high energy physics and astroparticle experiments the main features of these counters are the very large pulse height reduced cost per unit area and good about 1ns time resolution the field has enjoyed very lively progress in recent years including the introduction of a new avalanche mode of operation extension of the counting rate capabilities to levels around 10mhz cm 2 improvement of the time resolution for mips to 50 ps sigma and the achievement of position resolutions of a few tens of micrometer these new developments have extended the range of hep applications and promise new applications in medical imaging full article last modified 11 feb 2002 j schwiening
