ee368 face detection project ee368 digital image processing face detection project by gaurav srivastava siddharth joshi problem definition to detect faces in a class group photograph to differentiate female faces challenges varying lighting conditions various objects with pseudo skin color occluded faces different scale size of faces faces in non frontal position approach skin color segmentation morphological operations hole filling erosion eigenspace projection density estimation and peak detection detecting male female faces deciding face non face input image output image block diagram of implementation skin color segmentation ycbcr space better skin color localization than hsv space invariant under various lighting conditions result of skin color segmentation morphological operations hole filling 1 st level erosion diamond structuring element 2 nd & 3 rd level column erosion selection of blocks by size criterion binary image after hole filling different levels of erosion eigenspace decomposition training set of 53 facial images for kl transform first 20 eigenvectors used as principal components gaussian f space density estimation estimation of the likelihood function for the image data ie p x can be used to compute a local measure of the target saliency detected face probability density rms detection criterion difference in reconstruction errors for face non face using eigenspace projections gender determination projection calculations using multiple faces of a female calculation of rmse of projections of a facial candidate with stored projections original image detected faces male female conclusions combination of deterministic algorithms like pca f space density estimation and heuristics difficult to generalize the algorithm algorithm performs well on most frontal faces difficulty in detecting occluded faces
