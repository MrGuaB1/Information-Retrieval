slac pub 8582 new development in rf pulse compression slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8582 new development in rf pulse compression abstract several pulse compression systems have been proposed for future linear collider most of these systems require hundreds of kilometers of low loss waveguide runs to reduce the waveguide length and improve the efficiency of these systems components for multimoding active switches and non reciprocal elements are being developed in the multimoded systems a waveguide is utilized several times by sending different signals over different modes the multimoded components needed for these systems have to be able to handle hundreds of megawatts of rf power at the x band frequency and above consequently most of these components are overmoded we present the development of multimoded components required for such systems we also present the development efforts towards overmoded active component such as switches and overmoded non reciprocal components such as circulators and isolators full text pdf slac pub 8582 171 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8582 247 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
