stanford linguistics colloquium 16 january 1998 the ach ich alternation and the representation of german palatals orrin w robinson stanford university in the most recent descriptions of the ach ich alternation in modern standard german the distribution of and x is seen to follow from two rules one the assimilation of an underspecified dorsal fricative to a preceding back vowel the other a default rule filling in the feature back or front on all remaining dorsal fricatives both the assimilation rule and the default rule make the by now standard assumption that the feature back or front is dependent on the dorsal node and thus that both and x are dorsal consonants on the basis of certain well known substandard varieties of german spoken in the central german area it is argued in this talk that both the directionality of this analysis with as the default and x as the conditioned variant and the feature geometry outlined above are inadequate to capture the naturalness of the relationship between the standard and the substandard indeed the regularities found in the substandard are not even describable within such a system i suggest an analysis of both speech varieties in which the variant x may be seen as the default and in which the palatal in line with a number of recent analyses of palatals in other languages is viewed as a complex segment with associations to both the coronal and dorsal nodes within such a system i argue not only are the regularities within each speech variety clearly captured the relationship between them is also made comprehensible please note above represents a voiceless palatal fricative
