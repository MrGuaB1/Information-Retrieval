abstract bio stanford ee computer systems colloquium 4 15pm wednesday oct 26 2011 skilling auditorium stanford campus http ee380 stanford edu two short talks cosmos big data and big challenges condos and clouds pat helland about the talk cosmos big data and big challenges the underlying plumbing for bing includes a massively parallel storage and computation layer running over tens of thousands of servers in many data centers cosmos stores data triply replicated for high availability in simple byte streams the store layer of cosmos holds hundreds of petabytes of data applications are written in a high level set oriented language called scope which is similar to sql scope applications are executed in a distributed fashion across the servers in a massively parallel way optimizations try to ship the computation close to the data cosmos is an ongoing service with hundreds of departments using it for the back end calculations supporting bing recent innovations have included the development of structured stream with structured streams cosmos records information about the meta data indexing and data affinitization within the stream as it is being generated this meta data is then used by scope jobs which read the data to dramatically improve the overall performance of the system this talk will describe cosmos the mechanism for handling huge amounts of data and computation the challenges faced in supporting this real live service condos and clouds over the last 100 years the way people design build and use buildings has evolved it is now normal to construct a building without knowing in advance who will occupy the building in addition we increasingly have shared occupancy of our homes apartments and condos retail and office space to accomplish this change the way we use the buildings has evolved there is a new trust relationship customs and laws that establish the relationship between the occupants and the building managers recently our industry has been moving to implement cloud computing this has been very successful in some applications and very challenging in others this talk posits that many of the challenges we ve seen in cloud computing can be understood by looking at what has happened in buildings and their occupancy standardization usage patterns legal establishment of rights and responsibilities are all nascent in the area of cloud computing we examine a very common pattern in the implementation of software and a service and propose ways in which this pattern may be better supported in a multi tenant fashion slides download the slides for the cosmos talk in pdf format download the slides for the condos & clouds talk in pdf format about the speaker pat helland has over 30 years of experience in scalable and highly available computing he spent most of the 1980s at tandem as the chief architect for transaction processing plumbing for tandem computers nonstop system he worked at hal computers in the early 1990s where he architected a numa multiprocessor in the mid 1990s he started at microsoft where he built microsoft transaction server distributed transaction coordinator and sql service broker he spent a couple of years at amazon working on the product catalog and then returned to microsoft in 2005 for the last few years pat has been the architect for cosmos running inside bing he recently left microsoft to move to san francisco to be close to his grandkids contact information pat helland email phelland0215 at hotmail dot com
