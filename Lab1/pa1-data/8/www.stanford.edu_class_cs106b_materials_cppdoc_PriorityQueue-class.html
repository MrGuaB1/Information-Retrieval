class priorityqueue valuetype the stanford c++ libraries include pqueue h class priorityqueue valuetype this class models a linear structure called a priority queue in which values are processed in order of priority as in conventional english usage lower priority numbers correspond to higher effective priorities so that a priority 1 item takes precedence over a priority 2 item constructor priorityqueue initializes a new priority queue which is initially empty methods size returns the number of values in the priority queue isempty returns true if the priority queue contains no elements clear removes all elements from the priority queue enqueue value priority adds value to the queue with the specified priority dequeue removes and returns the highest priority value peek returns the value of highest priority in the queue without removing it constructor detail priorityqueue initializes a new priority queue which is initially empty usage priorityqueue valuetype pq method detail int size returns the number of values in the priority queue usage int n pq size bool isempty returns true if the priority queue contains no elements usage if pq isempty void clear removes all elements from the priority queue usage pq clear void enqueue valuetype value double priority adds value to the queue with the specified priority lower priority numbers correspond to higher priorities which means that all priority 1 elements are dequeued before any priority 2 elements usage pq enqueue value priority valuetype dequeue removes and returns the highest priority value if multiple entries in the queue have the same priority those values are dequeued in the same order in which they were enqueued usage valuetype first pq dequeue valuetype peek returns the value of highest priority in the queue without removing it usage valuetype first pq peek
