shreeder adibhatla ge lecture 5 april 28 2009 www stanford edu class ee392m tracking filters for estimation of jet engine deterioration dr shreeder adibhatla ge infrastructure bio dr shreeder adibhatla is a principal engineer in ge aviation's controls center of excellence where he oversees advanced control and diagnostics technologies for military and commercial product engines he obtained his bs in me from the iit in 1976 and ph d in me from the university of kentucky in 1982 he joined the advanced controls group at ge aircraft engines in 1985 he was responsible for control and diagnostics of multiple engine lines and managed several groups in ge engines before accepting his current position abstract tracking filters are on line parameter estimation algorithms this lecture will introduce the parameter estimation problem for aircraft engines and describe a few techniques for solving the problem including classical observers and kalman filters parameter estimation is an important part of engine prognostics and health management phm since the information obtained can be used to diagnose and isolate changes in gas path component health due to deterioration and damage these tracking filters which are increasingly being used in commercial and military jet engines will then be illustrated by means of a small benchmark problem involving more parameters to estimate than sensors which is the typical situation lecture notes lecture 5 charts in pdf
