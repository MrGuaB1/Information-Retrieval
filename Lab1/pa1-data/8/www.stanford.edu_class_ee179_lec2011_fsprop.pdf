properties of continuous time fourier series page 1 properties of continuous time fourier series in this handout we prove the various properties of fourier series that were discussed in class for all of these properties we will use the notation to denote the transformation between a periodic signal and its fourier series coefficients in the formulas below we assume the following fourier series transform pairs xp t cn and vp t dn 1 linearity axp t bvp t acn bdn proof 1 t0 t0 axp t bvp t e j2nf0tdt a t0 t0 xp t e j2nf0tdt+ b t0 t0 vp t e j2nf0tdt acn+bdn 2 multiplication modulation xp t vp t cn k ckdn k the right hand side is a discrete convolution proof by multiplying the fourier series representations of xp t and vp t we get zp t k ckej2kf0t m dmej2mf0t k m ckej2kf0tdmej2mf0t k m ckdmej2 k+m f0t 1 change variables n m k so that m n k and the above becomes k n ckdn k ej2nf0t n k ckdn k ej2nf0t which has the desired form with cn k ckdn k page 2 3 time shifting xp t  e j2nf0 cn proof xp t  n cnej2nf0 t  n e j2nf0 cn ej2nf0t 4 time reversal xp t c n proof xp t n cnej2nf0 t n cnej2 n f0t m c m ej2mf0t m c m ej2mf0t where the third equality follows from a change of variables and the last equality follows from a reordering of the summation 5 time scaling xp at n cnej2nf0 at proof direct substitution note that the fourier series coefficients are the same but the exponential basis functions have changed ie their time has been scaled by a 6 conjugation x p t c n proof x p t n cnej2nf0t n c ne j2nf0t m c m ej2mf0t m c m ej2mf0t where the third equality follows from a change of variables m n 7 parseval's relation 1 t0 t0 xp t 2dt n cn 2 proof 1 t0 t0 xp t x p t dt 1 t0 t0 xp t n cnej2nf0t n c n 1 t0 t0 xp t e j2nf0t dt cn n cn 2 note we only replaced one of the signals by its fourier series replacing both would have meant more work
