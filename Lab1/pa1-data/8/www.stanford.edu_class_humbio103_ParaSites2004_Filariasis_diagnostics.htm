untitled document filariasis diagnostics brugia malayi brugia timori wuchereria bancrofti diagnosis the first step towards developing a diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis is to establish a history of exposure in endemic areas laboratory tests can follow this basic clinical procedure these tests may include basic serology testing of peripheral blood for microfilariae detection keeping the periodicity of the microfilariae in mind drawing of blood for microfilaria diagnostics record wustl edu archive 1999 05 06 99 people htm a skin biopsy can also be performed but this test is generally reserved for the infection by tissue dwelling nematodes onchocerca volvulus new techniques for antigen detection represent the highest quality lab test for diagnosing infection by w bancrofti o with this test the parasite antigens can be detected independent of the microfilariae's periodicity individuals do not even need to be microfilaremic o all that is needed is blood from a finger prick o the test is done rapidly 1 10 minutes o costs only $1.50 test in areas with public health programs making it an effective affordable diagnostic tool for the developing world o no such test exists for brugian filariasis morphology because specific antigen tests do not exist for each variety of lymphatic filaria morphological analysis must still be conducted from some blood samples to correctly identify the species of microfilaria the microfilaria of brugia malayi have an easily identifiable tapered tail microfilaria of brugia timori are longer than those of brugia malayi wuchereria bancrofti have a curvature of their anterior ends and are thinner by comparison to the brugian microfilaria microfilaria of wuchereria bancroft microfilaria of brugia malayi microfilaria of brugia timori i created by eric crossen and nicole sandoval human biology 103 parasites and pestilence spring 2004 instructor d scott smith md
