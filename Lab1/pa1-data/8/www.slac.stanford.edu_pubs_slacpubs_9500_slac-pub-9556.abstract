the particle pushing parmela was used to design the photo injector beamline of the linac coherent light source lcls to be built at slac in 2005 parmela predicts that projected emittances smaller than 1.2 mm mrad and slice emittance smaller than 1.0 mm mrad will be achievable for 1nc 10ps electron bunches with an s band rf gun and an emittance compensating system to benchmark parmela comparisons between simulations and measurements for two photo injector test facilities the gun test facility gtf at slac and the deep ultra violet fel duvfel at bnl have been performed aspects of the modeling of fields and initial distributions are discussed the agreement between measured and simulated beam parameters projected and slice emittance twiss parameters is satisfying accordingly it gives credibility to the extrapolation made for studying the lcls case parmela also indicates possible improvements in the tuning of those facilities to achieve the lcls required beam properties
