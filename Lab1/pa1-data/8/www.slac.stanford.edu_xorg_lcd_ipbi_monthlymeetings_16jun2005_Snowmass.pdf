snowmass page 1 snowmass august 14 27 2005 work needed for snowmass both prior to and at snowmass very partial list for discussion 1 mdi panel report evaluation interact w mdi panel what are relevant questions what evaluation has been done organize and prioritize work to be done continue evaluation 2 working with ilc wg4 need a complete 2mrad extraction line imminent can chicane ramp and switch polarities while delivering luminosity for upstream energy chicane other requests to wg4 need to verify that existing requests on chicane designs have been implemented for upstream energy polarization m woods slac june 16 2005 page 2 work needed for snowmass both prior to and at snowmass 3 upstream energy measurements can chicane ramp and switch polarities while delivering luminosity how often to calibrate by ramping and switching polarities measurement procedure and requirements on resolution stability expected precision 4 upstream polarimetry laser system design and requirements expected precision 5 extraction line energy polarimetry geant simulations of 2mrad and 20mrad evaluate backgrounds evaluate sensitivity to beam jitter evaluate different parameter sets expected precision page 3 wg organization at snowmass there will be 3 sets of working groups accelerator detector concept alcpg there will be mdi sessions on the first wednesday afternoon 2nd tuesday afternoon need to discuss ipbi sessions ipbi breakout sessions on energy polarimetry forward region lumi spectrum joint ipbi wg4 sessions time to work what documents to produce
