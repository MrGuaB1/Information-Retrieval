struct and typedef in c struct and typedef in c struct s are the historic predecessors of classes so just as you would declare a class type called myclass in c++ or java class myclass so would you declare a struct type called mystruct in c struct mystruct what trips people up is that in c you can declare an instance of a struct type in the same breath that you declare the struct type struct mystruct instanceofmystruct note that this also allows you to create instances of anonymous struct types struct instanceofnamelessstruct now enter typedef which lets you create an alias type for some other type ie typedef uint32_t accountnumber this says that accountnumber is another name for the uint32_t type since struct types are also well types you can create aliases for struct types typedef struct mystruct aliasformystruct this code declares the struct type and creates the alias type for it in the same breath note that when you typedef you cannot also declare an instance of the type in the same breath so now i can use aliasformystruct instead of the wordy struct mystruct so for example i can declare an instance of the struct mystruct type by just saying aliasformystruct instanceofmystruct instead of doing struct mystruct instanceofmystruct and i can also make an even more useful alias typedef struct mystruct aliasformystruct this code creates the type alias aliasformystruct that represents a pointer to a struct mystruct
