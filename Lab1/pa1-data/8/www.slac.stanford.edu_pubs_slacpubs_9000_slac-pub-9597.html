slac pub 9597 anticoincidence detector for glast slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 9597 anticoincidence detector for glast abstract the gamma ray large area space telescope glast is now being designed by a number of collaborating institutions it will study the cosmic gamma radiation from 20 mev to 300 gev with high precision and sensitivity greatly expanding on the important egret results one of the key systems of the instrument the anticoincidence detector acd is designed to reject the majority of charged particles which are the background for any gamma ray experiment the acd of egret has suffered from the self veto effect when the products of the high energy photon interactions in the instrument's calorimeter cause a veto signal in the anticoincidence detector backsplash effect resulting in the degradation of the efficiency for high energy 5 gev gamma rays to avoid this effect the acd for glast is divided into many scintillating tiles with wave shifting fiber readout the design of this detector along with the beam test and simulation results are given in this paper full text pdf slac pub 9597 34.5 kb compressed postscript slac pub 9597 50 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 27 nov 2002 09 29 pst by htmlme pl
