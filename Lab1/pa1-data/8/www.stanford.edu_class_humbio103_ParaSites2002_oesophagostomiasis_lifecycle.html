the life cycle of oesophagostomum fast facts eggs are passed into the feces and hatch into l1 l1 develop into infective l3 in the environment in 6 7 days l3 are ingested and end up in the small intestine larvae exsheath in the si and penetrate the wall forming nodules possible life cycle of oesophagostomum in humans life cycle uncertainty in humans although the life cycle for oesophagostomiasis has been characterized for animals the route of transmission and infectivity are unknown for humans it is hypothesized that because this disease is a zoonosis the parasite's life cycle is similar to the life cycle seen in animals like sheep goats and cows see below one distinct difference in the parasitic life cycle during human infection is that the eggs are usually not transmitted out of the body along with the feces this is because the parasite is unable to complete its life cycle of penetrating the intestinal wall and the nodules in which it has become encapsulated therefore it is hypothesized that transmission between humans is low and that the majority of the infections are a result of soil contamination by livestock this explanation fails to explain the localization of the disease though it is important to note that the parasite's inability to complete its life cycle is actually one of the causes of disease center confirmed life cycle of oesophagostomum in livestock borrowed from colin johnstone's lecture on the strongyloidea introduction classification life cycle epidemiology clinical manifestations diagnosis treatment links references return to home page
