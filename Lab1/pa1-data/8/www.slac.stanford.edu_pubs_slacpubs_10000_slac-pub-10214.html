slac pub 10214 sizing of microdrops slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 10214 sizing of microdrops abstract several techniques for determining the size of small fluid microdrops with diameter ranging from 5 m to 30 m have been developed and evaluated using an automated variation on the millikan oil drop experiment the average diameter of a large sample of monodisperse fluid drops was determined by measuring their terminal velocity in air or if charged their motion under the influence of an electric field as well as by measurement of the magnitude of their brownian motion the diameter of individual drops was determined optically by direct observation using an imaging system based on a coupled device ccd camera the technique used to analyze the image data is based on a best fit technique taking the point spread function psf of the lens into account and yield results accurate to 1 based on a single image without the need for any collaboration by combining this technique with terminal velocity measurements the density of the fluid can be determined to similar accuracy full text pdf slac pub 10214 328 kb compressed postscript slac pub 10214 318 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 nov 2003 08 44 pst by htmlme pl
