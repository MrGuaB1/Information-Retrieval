slac pub 9619 perturbation expansion for high gain free electron laser saturation slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 9619 perturbation expansion for high gain free electron laser saturation abstract we develop a perturbation expansion for the solution of the nonlinear one dimensional free electron laser equations for a monochromatic wave the radiation field is expanded in a taylor series having a finite radius of convergence analytic continuation using pade approximates yields accurate results well into the saturation regime we also formulate the perturbation expansion for finite bandwidth self amplified spontaneous emission sase and determine the lowest order correction to the well known linear theory motivated by an approximation to the expansion coefficients we introduce a simplified model for the sase radiation field and use it to discuss sase statistics in the saturation regime before the onset of the sideband instability full text pdf slac pub 9619 122 kb compressed postscript slac pub 9619 221 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 09 jan 2003 14 06 pst by htmlme pl
