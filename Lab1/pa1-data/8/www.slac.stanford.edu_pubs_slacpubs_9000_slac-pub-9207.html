slac pub 9207 plasma lens backgrounds at a future linear collider slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 9207 plasma lens backgrounds at a future linear collider abstract a plasma lens might be used to enhance the luminosity of future linear colliders however its utility for this purpose depends largely on the potential backgrounds that may be induced by the insertion of such a device in the interaction region of the detector in this note we identify different sources of such backgrounds calculate their event rates from the elementary interaction processes and evaluate their effects on the major parts of a hypothetical next linear collider nlc detector for plasma lens parameters which give a factor of seven enhancement of the luminosity and using the nlc design for beam parameters as a reference we find that the background yields are fairly high and require further study and improvements in detector technology to avoid their impact full text pdf slac pub 9207 192 kb compressed postscript slac pub 9207 220 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 31 jul 2002 10 03 pdt by htmlme pl
