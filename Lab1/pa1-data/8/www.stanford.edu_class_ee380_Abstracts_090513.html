abstract bio stanford ee computer systems colloquium 4 15pm wednesday may 13 2009 hp auditorium gates computer science building b01 http ee380 stanford edu accelerating computation with fpgas with a seismic computation example michael flynn maxeler technologies and stanford about the talk for many high performance applications the alternative to the multicore rack is to use an accelerator assist to each multicore node there are a number of instances of these accelerators gpgpu specialized processors eg ibm's cell and fpgas at maxeler we ve found that the fpga array technology wins out on performance for most relevant applications given the initial area time power disadvantage of the fpga in say a custom designed adder this is a surprising result the sheer magnitude of the available fpga parallelism overcomes the initial disadvantage using maxeler's fpga compiler toolkit it is now feasible to transform a software application into a data flow graph mapped to an unconstrained systolic array the array structure can be matched to the applications structure and is not constrained to nearest neighbor communications as the fpga provides a generalized interconnect as an example we consider modeling problems in seismic data processing in a typical problem we realize a 2000 node systolic array on 2 fpga's each node performing an operation each 4 ns errata slide numbered 42 showing the various geophysics algorithms is courtesy of bob clapp of stanford geophysics not as indicated slides download the slides from this presentation in pdf format the errata above has been incorporated into the pdf version of the slides about the speaker michael flynn is now professor emeritus of ee at stanford he directed the architecture and arithmetic group in csl for many years he is now senior adviser and board chairman at maxeler contact information michael j flynn flynn maxeler com
