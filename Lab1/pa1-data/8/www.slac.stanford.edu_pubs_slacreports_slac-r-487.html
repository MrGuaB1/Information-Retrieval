slac r 487 longitudinal dynamics at the stanford linear collider slac slac pubs and reports slac r 487 longitudinal dynamics at the stanford linear collider abstract experiments were performed on the stanford linear collider to study the longitudinal properties of the electron and positron beams beginning in the damping ring to the end of the linac the measurements were performed with a streak camera and wire scanners in the damping ring single particle as well as high current behavior was measured the effects of shaping the bunch distribution in the bunch compressor and the longitudinal wakefield energy loss in the linac are presented the longitudinal beam dynamics are also simulated and compared to the measurements full text pdf slac r 487 7.64 mb compressed postscript not available for this document more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 18 jul 2006 10 24 pdt by htmlme pl
