c 1 68 69 page 1 c 1 68 69 comments on the electromagnetic form factor of the charged pion by ja poirier richard wilson harvard university 1 the liquid hz target is not essential beryllium does almost as well on electron nucleon there is no point in reducing target thickness below o oz radiation lengths because of radiative corrections the hydrogen however has the merit of reducing background a negative pion is not produced in it p collisions until three pions exist in the final state z in the beam we might use wire spark chambers operated in the proportional mode as charpak has developed this can operate at a high beam intensity 3 we need either a scintillation or proportional counter to check on two outgoing particles from the target not one l due to landau straggling it is not possible to exclude three 4 i prefer a hofstadter type nai absorption counter to the lead scintillator sandwich because of its superior pulse height resolution 5 the anticounter must be large enough to exclude all outgoing particles which are not in the forward direction it can be fat enough to convert itoy rays and or neutrons then the only backgrounds are it p it it it n it masquerades as an electron n has too iowan energy to be detected in the anticounter this is clearly small 57
