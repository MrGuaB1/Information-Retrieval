slac pub 6263 heavy quark symmetry slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 6263 heavy quark symmetry abstract we review the current status of heavy quark symmetry and its applications to weak decays of hadrons containing a single heavy quark after an introduction to the underlying physical ideas we discuss in detail the formalism of the heavy quark effective theory including a comprehensive treatment of symmetry breaking corrections we then illustrate some nonperturbative approaches which aim at a dynamical qcd based calculation of the universal form factors of the effective theory the main focus is on results obtained using qcd sum rules finally we perform an essentially model independent analysis of semileptonic b meson decays in the context of the heavy quark effective theory equations render on windows mac os aix linux solaris and irix with the techexplorer plug in full text pdf slac pub 6263 8.06 mb compressed postscript not available for this document more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 06 jan 2006 10 16 pst by htmlme pl
