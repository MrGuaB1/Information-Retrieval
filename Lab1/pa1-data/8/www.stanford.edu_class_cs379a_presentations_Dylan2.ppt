combinatorial computational method gives new picomolar ligands for a known enzyme combinatorial computational method gives new picomolar ligands for a known enzyme bartosz a grzybowski alexey v ishchenko chu young kim george topalov robert chapman david w christianson george m whitesides and eugene i shakhnovich objective design a new method for generating and screening drug leads combismog combines facets of combinatorial and rational drug design tested on human carbonic anhydrase ii hca knowledge base derived from 1000 protein ligand complexes in pdb verification two of the best compounds were synthesized and evaluated in vivo x crystallography showed agreement with predicted binding mode outline algorithm scoring function locates two atoms on ligand and protein closer than 5 a contacts classified by atom types frequency of occurrence ligands are generated from 100 common functional groups starting from a seed program grows a ligand evaluating after each iteration if ligand has lower score than before piece is rejected can generate 50000 ligands day algorithm seed benzenesulfonamide binds zinc in active site top compounds verification of results two of top five compounds enantiomers were synthesized r stereoisomer most potent hca ii inhibitor known k d 30 pm x ray crystal structure showed docking similar to predicted verification binding constants k d of other ligands also correlates with combismog score conclusions study carried out under ideal circumstances large knowledge base known pharmacophore combismog generated 100000 ligands in 60 h simulations essentially correlate with experimental results discussion would this program be as useful in the absence of a known pharmacophore without ample crystallographic knowledge what advantages come with having a specified set of building blocks
