slac pub 8555 short high charge bunches in the slac linac slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8555 short high charge bunches in the slac linac abstract these days the linac at the stanford linear accelerator center slac is mainly an injector for the pep ii rings but besides the electrons and positrons for pep ii it provides a 30 gev electron or positron beam to the end of the linac into the fftb final focus test beam area or creates a test beam for the a line in the fftb tunnel there are two plasma experiments installed which have demonstrate plasma focussing and plasma acceleration up to 0.5 gev m the acceleration goes linear with the current and is inversely proportional to the square of the bunch length therefore we are pushing the bunch length to shorter and shorter values adjusting the r 56 in the rtl ring to linac compression section and precompressing the bunches in the damping ring the nonlinearity of the rf and the higher order dispersion are becoming more important for bigger compression factors then the high charge short bunches will create strong longitudinal wakefields in the linac they create a double horned energy profile and have different beam dynamics than a long bunch in the linac measurements of the beam properties like stability distributions tails and backgrounds are discussed in this paper full text pdf slac pub 8555 97.2 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8555 69.4 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
