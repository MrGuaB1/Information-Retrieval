problem 1 page 1 problem 1 a false the sum of weight of outgoing edges must sum to one incoming edges sum has no restrictions b false the edges s t denotes the probability t given s c false p x  p  1 p x 1  1 p  2  1 d true viterbi does max of numbers while forward does sum of numbers since all numbers are non negative the sum is greater than or equal to the max e true they are both o k k n where k states and n sequence length f false it gives the probability distribution over states at each position g false vanilla hmms are good for intronic and not so good for exonic regions only the intronic regions length seems to have a distribution that is nearly geometric h false we can use higher order hmms to model condition on two or more previous timesteps i false indeed em is guaranteed to converge to a solution though not necessarily the globally optimal one p
