b 1 68 87 lepton conservation tests at high momentum transfer using the v shield d cline university of wisconsin we propose tha page 1 b 1 68 87 lepton conservation tests at high momentum transfer using the v shield d cline university of wisconsin we propose that the energy spectrum and charge spectrum of i s coming out of the back of the shield and passing through the bubble cham ber should provide the possibility of testing lepton conservation at high momentum transfer in order for this to be a meaningful test it is essential that the parent hadron beam rr or k be of one charge thus producing v or 11 predominantly experimentally the spectrum of i i i s coming from the shield wall is measured in the bubble chamber using the spark chamber behind the bubble chamber to prove that the charged particles are indeed i s since on average 20 80 jj s will come out of the shield for a reasonable v beam the accumulation of 100000 pulses of the bubble chamber is equivalent to the observation of 6 2 8 x f0 vi interactions a sizable fraction of these events will come from relatively high momentum transfer breakdown at high momentum transfers of lepton conservation would presumably result in the occurrence of the process v z jj z f f jj as compared to the ordinary process v z jj z f 2 jj page 2 b 1 68 87 2 one background for these processes would come from v z j 1 j 1 v z 3 j 1 with the penetrating the shield and the ji being stopped since the 40 cross section for eq 3 is 10 em2 nucleus for iron with e 10 v 38 bev c compared to a 10 nucleus for eq 2 the background from such processes should be small at any rate the background from eq 3 is probably calculable by knowing the spectrum of v and the shield density any breakdown of lepton conservation can be traced as to the general momentum transfer at which the breakdown occurs
