slac fractional charge search physics search for isolated fractionally charged particles determining the mass and electric charge of the falling fluid drops the terminal velocity of a fluid drop falling in air in an electric field is determined by its radius charge and mass since the density of our test fluid is known we need to determine only the charge and mass by taking measurements of the terminal velocity of the same fluid drop with two different e field values two equations can be obtained to solve for the values of the drop's charge and mass the charge measurement accuracy is limited in our apparatus by brownian motion for 6 micron diameter drops a measurement accuracy of 1 100 e has been obtained slac home mps home hist phys fcmat apparat testmat microdrop results team refs mpsphys mspappat mpsrefs october 13 1998 stanford linear accelerator center website maintenance erlee slac stanford edu
