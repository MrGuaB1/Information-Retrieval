a very little bit about thermocouples page 1 a very little bit about thermocouples rob candler april 2008 comments corrections and feedback are greatly appreciated consider a metal wire if there is a temperature gradient across this wire the electrons in it will redistribute to have a lower concentration at the hot side which gives rise to a voltage as described by the seebeck effect this voltage is dependent upon material properties if we electrically connect two wires of different material and place them such that they both experience the temperature gradient they will have different voltage drops which we can measure ambient probe ambient probe probe ambient t t t t t t v v v v t v copper constantan constantan copper constantan copper change erature with temp change voltage ofnt coeffiecie       as can be seen from the equation above we are sensing the difference between tprobe and tambient not tprobe wouldn t it be nice if we could replace tambient which could change over time with something a bit more stable we can an ice bath can be used in the configuration below follow through the math to see how the measured voltage is independent of ambient temperature page 2 ice probe ambient ice ice probe probe ambient t t t t t t t t v age change nt of volt coeffiecie t v copper constantan copper constantan copper
