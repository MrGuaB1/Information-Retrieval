truss lab e14 truss lab name _______________ part 1 o load the center of a flat beam by adding weights grab whatever you can find to a bucket until the beam collapses record the weight s used for later use try to increase the weight in small increments if possible part 2 o using the same weight that caused the beam to collapse load the full truss truss a as shown above make sure you support the truss with your hands so it only experiences loading in the plane the truss circle one is rigid wobbles collapses o continue to load truss a until it fails where did the truss fail which member or pin failed ____________ part 3 trace your truss onto a piece of foamcore and cut it out except this time remove members bf and df truss b o using the same weight that caused the beam to collapse load the new truss truss b again make sure you support the truss with your hands so it only experiences loading in the plane the truss circle one is rigid wobbles collapses o continue to load truss b until it fails where did the truss fail which member or pin failed ____________ what amount of weight did truss b support at failure relative to truss a give an approximate percent _______ post lab 1 both the truss and the beam were designed to span the same distance with the same amount of material the truss supports less the same more weight than the beam 2a was there any difference between where truss a and b failed yes no 2b why do you think this occurred 3 complete the full truss analysis all parts of problem 2 in the prelab
