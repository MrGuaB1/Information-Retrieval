slac in house energy management program may 2002 update slac energy management program energy management update may 2002 published in the interaction point may 2002 vol 13 no 4 we have good news in the field of energy management doe federal energy management program femp administration approved $330.5 k funding for slac to implement phase 1 of the klystron gallery lighting upgrade project in addition we secured a california energy commission grant of $92.7 k for this project the project entails replacement of 1580 incandescent lamps and 275 energy inefficient fluorescent lighting fixtures in the klystron gallery with new energy efficient fluorescent lights the projected saving is 3.7 gwh per year yes you read the amount correctly it is indeed 3.7 giga watt hours per year or enough yearly power for about 500 homes our recently completed pilot installation in sector 12 received the approval of klystron gallery building managers al baker and tom graul as exceeding the existing standards for illumination this is the first major step toward implementation of a site wide lighting upgrade program many areas at slac present opportunities to improve energy efficiency lack of on demand lighting controls and inefficient lighting is disappointing to some at slac who would like to see us move faster however these energy conservation projects require capital investments and even with good saving to investment ratios and short payback periods the funding is somewhat difficult to obtain we at se&m are continually working on development and submission of proposals for procurement of funds for energy conservation projects the central chilled water plant upgrade is another project with good energy savings potential the project is being funded out of the slac general plant project budget and will be in full operation by the end of may 2002 it is currently under construction and is being managed by kingston chan se&m the scope of work includes replacement of three old inefficient chillers with new energy efficient machines and improving the chilled water pumping system for energy efficiency the expected energy saving for this project is 2.3 gwh per year the summer period featuring high electrical demands is coming upon us again please continue implementing simple no cost or low cost energy conservation measures for energy conservation tips and other energy related information visit our energy management website at www slac stanford edu slac energy sector 12 south aisle lighting note before l and after r illumination down the length of the klystron gallery photos l fieguth luda fieguth slac slac energy conservation program content luda fieguth page mcdunn last update saturday february 11 2006
