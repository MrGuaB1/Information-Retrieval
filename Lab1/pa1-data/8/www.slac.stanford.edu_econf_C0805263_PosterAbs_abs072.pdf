limits on cosmogenic neutrinos from the hires experiment page 1 limits on cosmogenic neutrinos from the hires experiment kai martens for the hires collaboration the hires experiment uses the fluorescence technique to measure the highest energy cosmic rays through horizontal air showers it has access to two neutrino signatures the decay of neutrino induced tau leptons and lpm delayed showers from electron neutrino interactions in the ground experimental limits derived from the non observation of neutrino induced air showers are pre sented alongside with a neutrino flux estimate based on hires measurements of both flux and composition of the highest energy cosmic rays and their propagation through the cosmic mi crowave background
