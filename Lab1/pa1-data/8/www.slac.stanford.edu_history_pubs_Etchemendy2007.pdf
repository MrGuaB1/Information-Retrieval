page 1 page 2 llluminating the possible john etchemendy this historical overview is an excerpt from rernarks by stanford provost john etchernendy at an october zo 2006 groundbreaking at slac for the linac coherent light source lcls the lcls the first x ray free electron laser in the world will produce ultrashort ultrafast x ray pulses a billion tirnes brighter than any other source on earth it is the fourth generation of instruments designed to produce synchrotron radiation for scientific research a concept that slac pioneered in the 19 os the lcls is the largest science facility under construction by the us department of energy tanford takes great pride in the stanford linear accelerator center and in our long partnership in this enterprise with the department of energy slac was hatched in a nearby los altos hills living room by stanford professors in electrical engineering microwave and high energy physics laboratories they further eadweard muybridge photographed leland stanford jr on his pony top lett and a trotting horse and driver bottom lett for his horseinrnotion studies at governor 5tenford's palo alto stock farm stanford university rch1 es renned the idea as physicists tend to do at a beer garden just down the road they called it project m m meaning monster in retrospect construction of slac was an accomplishment almost beyond imagination given the overwhelming iinancial and engineering impediments it presented and the scientific leap of faith it required but if history has taught us anything it is that our inventions become more than embodiments of our aspirations they command our attention and stretch our capabilities in ways imagination alone cannot at their best they surprise us by taking us places we could never anticipate slac has done that and so too will the linac coherent light source lcls the interplay of science and the instruments of science cannot be clisentangled ian hacking a historian of science and former teacher of mine used to say that the history of science and the history of instruments were one and the same tom hankins and robert silverstein put it well in their book instruments and the imagination they wrote instruments have a life oftheir own they do not rnerelyfollow theory oen they determine theory because instruments determine what is possible and what is possible determines to a large extent what can be thought the telescope the microscope the chronograph the photograph all gave rise to a blossoming of theoretical understanding not possible before their invention page 3 uybridge's cameras are set up for his pioneering experiments in instantaneous photography which enabled him to capture images of subjects in motion let me mention just one example bound up in stanford's history instantaneous photography was developed in the nineteenth century to enable images to be captured without first immobilizing their subjects a limitation ofthe photographic instruments ofthe day less than a mile from where we are standing eadweard muybridge one ofthe pioneers ofthe technique famously refined the technology to capture a horse's gallop at governor stanford's behest muybridge went stanfurd university archives ssrl the synchrotron radiation lab another amazing instrument built at slac but kornberg s discovery was the culmination of 2 o years of painstaking work to on to study many forms of human and animal locomotion while others applied his techniques to investigate the dynamics and kinematics of all manner of objects like the telescope and the microscope instantaneous photography bestowed on science a new set of eyes what instantaneous photography clidjor optical images the linac coherent light source will do _ hr xray imaging allowing as to see processes and phenomena that simply cannot he immobilized to see so to speak the molecular develop techniques to immobilize the transcription process immobilize it so it could be captured by ssrl's state of the art x ray beam what instantaneous photography did for optical images the lcls will do for x ray imaging allowing us to see processes and revealing phenomena that counterparts of governor phenomena that simply were previously open only cannot be lmmobilized to to speculation sighiovcfs l10i s6 see so to speak the over the years six molecular counterparts of nobel prizes have resulted from research conducted at slac five of these were in physics enabled by the great instrument that gave the facility its name the sixth awarded earlier this month honored roger kornberg's discovery of the mechanism of dna transcription a rnechanisrn ultimately revealed through images captured at e governor stanford's horse the lcls will yield fundamental discoveries in physics chemistry biology and materials science it will generate applications in medicine nanotechnology energy production and dozens of other fields we know that but what is most exciting is that the lcls will take us places no one can predict
