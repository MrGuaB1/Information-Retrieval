slac pub 8472 light cone wavefunction representation of deeply virtual compton scattering slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8472 light cone wavefunction representation of deeply virtual compton scattering abstract we give a complete representation of virtual compton scattering gamma p gamma p at large initial photon virtuality q 2 and small momentum transfer squared t in terms of the light cone wavefunctions of the target proton we verify the identities between the skewed parton distributions h x zeta t and e x zeta t which appear in deeply virtual compton scattering and the corresponding integrands of the dirac and pauli form factors f1 t and f2 t and the gravitational form factors a q t and b q t for each quark and anti quark constituent we illustrate the general formalism for the case of deeply virtual compton scattering on the quantum fluctuations of a fermion in quantum electrodynamics at one loop full text pdf slac pub 8472 322 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8472 232 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
