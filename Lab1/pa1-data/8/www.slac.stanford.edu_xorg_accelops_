accelerator options report accelerator technology options report 18 march 2004 this is the final report on the us linear collider technology options study by the us linear collider steering group accelerator sub committee linear collider option task forces this study was carried out at the request of the united states linear collider steering group uslcsg the establishment of such a body was recommended by the hepap subpanel on long range planning the uslcsg executive committee asked the accelerator subcommittee to carry out an evaluation of two options for a us sited linear collider the two options were to be based on the normal conducting x band rf technology developed by the glc nlc collaboration and the superconducting l band rf technology developed by the tesla collaboration the physics design requirements which both technical options must meet were established by the physics and detector subcommittee of the uslcsg the report is available either as the full report or as individual chapters in the list below full report link 13158 kby introduction executive summary conclusions chapters 1 2 and 9 and appendix link 608 kby reference designs chapter 3 link 9759 kby availability design chapter 4 link 638 kby cost and schedule chapter 5 link 942 kby civil construction and siting chapter 6 link 2451 kby design variants chapter 7 link 886 kby risk assessment chapter 8 link 722 kby note that within the pdf files the table of contents list of figures or list of tables provide hyperlinks to the material but only within the open file the links will work everywhere within the full report file but for example within the chapter 4 file the hyperlinks will work only if the link points to something in the chapter 4 file
