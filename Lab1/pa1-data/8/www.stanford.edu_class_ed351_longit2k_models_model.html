growth curve models and parameters of interest this section contains some edited pages taken from technical expositions to give an overview of the straight line growth curve models that are the basis for the data analysis in the timepath97 program a full listing of the quantities provided by the program is described in the materials under the tp output tab formulation of growth curve models and parameters of interest embed in pdf format the material below describes the growth curve models and the parameters derived from the models if embed does not work in your browser you can link to the pdf document for model and to the pdf document for params models for collections of growth curves research questions and for straight line growth parameters of interest if embed does not work in your browser you can link to the pdf document for params
