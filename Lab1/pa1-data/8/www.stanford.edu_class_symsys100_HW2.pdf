symsys 100 homework 2 page 1 symsys 100 homework 2 due thursday may 5 note please write each question on a separate labeled sheet 1 in the following problems use the conventions on turing machines from the lectures and the reading you may want to use t his applet a write instructions for a turing machine that rewrites the input one place to the right so for example on input 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 your machine should halt with the following configuration 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 b write instructions for a turing machine that computes f f x x 2 if x is even x 1 2 if x is odd 2 consider a model of computation called the parallel turing machine which computes on two inputs at a time on two separate tapes that is instead of reading one cell at a time a parallel turing machine has rules of the form if in state 3 reading 0 on tape 1 and 1 on tape 2 then write a 1 on tape 1 and a 0 on tape 2 move to the left and enter state 6 give an informal proof that anything a parallel turing machine can com pute a turing machine could already compute 3 a prove using the truth table method that the rule of modus tollens is valid b a b a b explain in words why checking whether a truth assignment satisfies a formula is faster than testing whether a formula is valid 4 for the definition of a plausibility model s ee the handout on the webpage a define a plausibility model in which a b and b c both hold but a c fails b prove that in any plausibility model if a c and b c both hold then a b c holds 1
