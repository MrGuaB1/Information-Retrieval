theoretical physics apply to work with us doe logo theoretical physics october 1 2011 slac theory group theoretical physics apply to work with us postdoctoral positions the slac national accelerator laboratory holds an annual competition for theoretical physics research associate postdoctoral positions we welcome applications from anyone working in theoretical high energy physics broadly defined the activities of our group cover the whole range of interests from low energy qcd in nuclei to m theory and quantum gravity this year we will accept all applications through the website https academicjobsonline org ajo we will no longer be accepting applications by physical mail if you have any difficulties please contact mherraez slac stanford edu for the 2011 competition candidates should be sure to submit all materials by december 1 2011 the positions we will offer will begin on october 1 2012 and run for a 3 year term 1 the slac national accelerator laboratory theory group subscribes to the rutgers agreement on postdoctoral offer acceptance deadlines in fact we normally do not give an acceptance deadline when we offer a postdoctoral position long term visitors the slac national accelerator laboratory theory group would be pleased to arrange visits to our group from theoretical physicists who have won traveling fellowships or have other sources of outside financial support to inquire about visiting our group under such an arrangement please contact professor joanne hewett by email at hewett slac stanford edu in principle we can provide a supplement to outside fellowships but our funding for this purpose is severely limited summer program the slac national accelerator laboratory theory group has a limited budget to support theorists who wish to visit the laboratory in the summer typically we will arrange to share costs with your home institution to facilitate your visit to the slac national accelerator laboratory we welcome summer visitors in all fields of theoretical high energy physics but especially theorists who would like to interact directly with physicists in the slac national accelerator laboratory experimental programs to inquire about the summer program please contact prof joanne hewett by email at hewett slac stanford edu if it is possible we would like to hear from you before march 31 for a visit in the upcoming summer maria c herraez
