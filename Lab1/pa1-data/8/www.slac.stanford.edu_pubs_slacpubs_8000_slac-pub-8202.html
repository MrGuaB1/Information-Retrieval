slac pub 8202 recent beam beam experience with multiple high current bunches in pep ii slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8202 recent beam beam experience with multiple high current bunches in pep ii abstract operation with colliding beams at pep ii has progressed remarkably well with over half the design specific luminosity and 5.2 x10 32 cm 2 s 1 in multiple bunches demonstrated during the last commissioning period before installation of the babar detector further luminosity increases are anticipated as the vertical beam size is reduced and beam currents are raised towards design values at high currents interesting multibunch dynamics which depend strongly on current distribution have been observed during single beam commissioning studies transverse beam instabilities nominally controlled using bunch by bunch feedback were observed to be significantly suppressed in the absence of feedback with beams in collision full text pdf slac pub 8202 212 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8202 196 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
