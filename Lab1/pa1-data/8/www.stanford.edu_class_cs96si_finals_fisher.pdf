david fisher a sampling of functional data structures for my final project i implemented a couple of functional data structures page 1 david fisher a sampling of functional data structures for my final project i implemented a couple of functional data structures from chris okasaki's excellent phd thesis purely functional data structures specifically i wrote haskell implementations of a double ended queue often called a deque and a binomial heap i also used this as an opportunity to learn about two methods of amortized analysis commonly used on functional data structures the banker's method and the physicist's method though these two methods are equivalent in analytic power they differ in their approach briefly the banker's method involves tracking runtime credits for each individual position which can be later used to pay for occasional operations with more expensive specific runtimes the physicist's method deals instead with an overall potential function on data structure state which again is later used to pay for more expensive operations though i did not have time to examine all the data structures and learn all the analysis techniques for my final project i plan to finish reading okasaki's thesis during the summer
