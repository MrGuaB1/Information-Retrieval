conservative constraints on dark matter annihilation into gamma rays page 1 poster abstract neutrino 08 conference conservative constraints on dark matter annihilation into gamma rays thomas d jacques gregory d mack john f beacom nicole f bell hasan yuksel abstract using gamma ray data from the milky way andromeda and the cos mic background we calculate conservative upper limits on the dark mat ter self annihilation cross section into monoenergetic gamma rays av  over a wide range of dark matter masses if br  were known then av  br  would define an upper limit on the total cross section in the absence of this knowledge we conservatively assume br  10 4 for intermediate dark matter masses gamma ray based and neutrino based upper limits on the total cross section are comparable with the former dom inating for small masses and the latter for large masses we comment on how these results depend on the assumptions about astrophysical inputs and annihilation final states and how glast and other gamma ray experiments can improve upon them
