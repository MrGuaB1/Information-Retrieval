slac r 557 precision measurement of the spin structure of the proton and the deuteron slac slac pubs and reports slac r 557 precision measurement of the spin structure of the proton and the deuteron abstract experiment e155 at the stanford linear accelerator center measured the spin structure functions g 1 and g 2 of the proton and deuteron using deep inelastic scattering of 50 gev polarized electrons from dynamically polarized solid 15 nh 3 and lid targets three independent spectrometers covering a large kinematic region 0.014 x bjorken 0.9 and 1 q 2 40 gev c 2 detected 200 million events a fully self consistent and statistically sound approach to calculating radiative corrections was developed providing well defined statistical errors for the e155 data set also a comprehensive fit to the global data set was created which simultaneously describes all existing data on p d and n 3 he targets the results represent a significant increase in the accuracy of the world data set and together with the existing data give improved results for the bjorken sum rule and the quark spins the gluon contribution to the nucleon spin is confirmed to be significant full text pdf slac r 557 2.93 mb compressed postscript not available for this document notes the pdf file contains color error messages in some chapters text reads and prints find but in black & white only more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 06 jun 2006 11 40 pdt by htmlme pl
