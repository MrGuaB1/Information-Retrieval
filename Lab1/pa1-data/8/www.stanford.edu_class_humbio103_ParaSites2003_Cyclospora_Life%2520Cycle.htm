life cycle life cycle the unsporulated and non infectious oocysts are deposited into the environment in human stool sporulation occurs after days or weeks at temperatures between 22 c to 32 c sporulation divides the sporont into two sporocysts each containing two elongate sporozoites food or waterborne transmission follows the oocysts are ingested the oocysts excyst in the gastrointestinal tract freeing the sporozoites which invade the epithelial cells of the jejunum once the sporozoites are inside the cells they undergo asexual multiplication and then sexual development to mature into oocysts the mechanisms of contamination of food and water are still under investigation http www dpd cdc gov dpdx html cyclosporiasis asp body frames af cyclosporiasis body_cyclosporiasis_page1 htm a few interesting notes incubation period http www soton ac uk ceb diagnosis vol2 htm the period from infection to disease ranges from 2 to 11 days with the average being one week the long incubation period has implications for transmission because of this long incubation period it is virtually impossible to have person to person transmission why are there still life cycle mysteries research into the possible modes of contamination is limited by the fact that it is difficult to detect the low levels of cyclospora in the samples additionally the lack of an animal host also constrains life cycle research
