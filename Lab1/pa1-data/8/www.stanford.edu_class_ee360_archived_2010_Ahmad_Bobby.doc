space time adaptive processing stap in wireless communications bobby barnes ee360 project proposal space time adaptive processing stap in wireless communications space time adaptive processing stap algorithms are proposed to be able to mitigate the effects of interference in wireless communication systems one particular stap implementation is known as the covariance matrix estimation approach my project will consist of a lit erature survey of 2 3 papers covering this approach and it s implementation if time permits a simulation will be written to numerically look at the effects of stap on interference cancellation in wireless communications the benefits of any interference cancellation can be realized in additional capacity for the channel
