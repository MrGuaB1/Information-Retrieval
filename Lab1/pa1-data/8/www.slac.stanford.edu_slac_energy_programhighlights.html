slac in house energy management program slac energy management program slac in house energy management program published in the interaction point may 2001 vol 12 no 4 energy is in the news some already know and others may be pleased to learn that for many years slac has had an on going in house energy management program ihem as required by doe slac participates by initiating energy conservation projects performing life cycle cost analysis and submitting these proposals to the doe federal energy management program femp as funding requests in competition with other doe laboratories the primary criterion for granting funds is the savings to investment ratio measured over the life of a project through this program over the last ten years we have received funds totaling about $7.2 million from doe femp with these funds we have implemented projects that include installation of a synchronous capacitor for site power factor correction klystron modulator upgrades for energy recovery installation of linac remote utility monitoring and control system installation of a direct digital control energy management system ddc ems to control main campus heating air conditioning and chilled water systems installation of variable frequency drives vfds at pumps and fan motors and replacement of lcw pump motors with premium efficiency motors this year we have submitted proposals for a few projects with a total estimated cost of $900 k primarily to upgrade inefficient indoor lighting the current california energy crisis has renewed public interest in energy conservation and we at slac need to re examine how we can help we are planning more energy conservation projects the most promising on site projects with the best economics are site lighting upgrades such as replacement of inefficient lamps and ballasts provision of occupancy sensors for indoor lighting vfds for pumps and fans premium efficiency motors ddc ems expansion and power factor correction we are also examining the use of energy saving performance contracts espc these contracts allow us to use private sector funds for projects with loan repayment from the energy cost savings thus the initial capital investment is not from the slac budget and annual payments are equal to the cost of the saved energy lately the espc contracts are increasingly popular at doe laboratories in addition it is important that we all help slac to conserve energy please implement simple energy conservation measures such as turning off printers copiers and monitors when idle activating power saver and sleep features shutting off coffee pots radios fans and other appliances in the office and turning off lights when leaving a room another area with potential for significant energy saving is the experiment related energy consuming systems we would like to hear your ideas on this matter any suggestions or questions on any energy related issues would be appreciated please submit your ideas proposals to ihem program manager luda fieguth x3422 luda slac stanford edu or burl skaggs x2245 burl slac stanford edu luda fieguth slac slac energy conservation program content luda fieguth page mcdunn last update saturday february 11 2006
