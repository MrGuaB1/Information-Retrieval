slac pub 8437 linear collider diagnostics slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8437 linear collider diagnostics abstract each major step toward higher energy particle accelerators relies on new technology linear colliders require beams of unprecedented brightness and stability instrumentation and control technology is the single most critical tool that enables linear colliders to extend our energy reach in this paper we focus on the most challenging aspects of linear collider instrumentation systems in the next linear collider nlc high brightness multibunch e e beams with i 10 12 particles pulse and sigma x y 50 x 5 mu m originate in damping rings and are subsequently accelerated to several hundred gev in 2 x band 11424 mhz linacs from which they emerge with typical sigma x y 7 x 1mu m following a high power collimation section the e e beams are focused to sigma x y 300 x 5 nm at the interaction point in this paper we will review the beam intensity position and profile monitors x y z mechanical vibration sensing and stabilization systems long baseline rf distribution systems and beam collimation hardware full text pdf slac pub 8437 463 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8437 1.57 mb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
