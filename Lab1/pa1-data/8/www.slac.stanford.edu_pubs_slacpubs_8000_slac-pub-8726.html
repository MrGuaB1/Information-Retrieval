slac pub 8726 possible quantum mechanical effect on beam echo slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8726 possible quantum mechanical effect on beam echo abstract the echo effect in charged particle beams provides a link between macroscopic measurable beam parameters and microscopic phase space motion of the beam since quantum mechanics dictates a granularization of the phase space it influences how the phase space behaves microscopically and thus potentially affect how the echo effect behaves macroscopically in this study we propose to examine the possible measurable macroscopic effects of quantum mechanics on beams through its echo effect full text pdf slac pub 8726 115 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8726 61.7 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 06 pdt by htmlme pl
