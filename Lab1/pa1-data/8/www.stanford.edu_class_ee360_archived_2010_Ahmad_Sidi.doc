modeling packet delay over wireless networks with link retransmissions for media communications modeling packet delay over wireless networks with link retransmissions jonathan sidi sidi stanford edu t opic area and m otivation in this project we are interested in deriving a model for the delay incurred by specified link layer retransmission policies over wireless packet networks in wireless networks the performance of transport protocols is greatly degraded due to the higher error rate recent approaches have emphasized the benefit of performing link layer retransmissions to provide a more reliable link at a cost of a slight increase of delay on the other ha nd the interest for providing qos over packet based networks raises the need to satisfy specific delay proposed w ork the overall goal and emphasis of this modeling project will be to come up with simple stationnary delay distributions for sev eral cases of interests and link retransmission policies simulation may be of help if analysis seems too complex the flow of packets is transmitted between neighboring nodes the wireless li nk between two nodes is expected to be model ed as a two state gilbert elliot model possibly derived from a rayleigh fading channel to capture the burst error characteristic for the packets in a wireless environment at each node we will model a queue with its associated markovian process es of arrival and service time we will first consider the case with no link retransmission then introduce schemes allowing some link layer retransmission arq we expect these retransmissions leading to a spread in the delay distribution to be possibly implemented in two different situations lost of packets or detection of corrupted packets by the following node time permitting we will attempt to consider the case where the arrival process of packets in a node has a rate that can vary to capture burstiness
