slac pub 9573 the di photon background to a light higgs boson at the lhc slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 9573 the di photon background to a light higgs boson at the lhc abstract recent years have seen a significant advance in our ability to calculate two loop matrix elements in this talk we describe an application of this breakthrough to improve our understanding of the background to the search for a light higgs boson at the lhc in particular we focus on the qcd corrections to the gluon fusion subprocess gg to gamma gamma which forms an important component of the background in the di photon channel we find that the k factor for this subprocess is significantly smaller than estimated previously full text pdf slac pub 9573 145 kb compressed postscript slac pub 9573 210 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 12 dec 2002 10 42 pst by htmlme pl
