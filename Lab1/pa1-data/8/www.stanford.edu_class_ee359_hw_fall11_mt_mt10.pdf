ee 359 wireless communications fall 2010 midterm page 1 ee 359 wireless communications fall 2010 midterm 1 kanye west taylor swift and wireless communications 30 points in this problem we investigate the scattering function and its impact on communications between taylor and kanye kanye west is driving down rodeo drive in beverly hills listening to taylor swift's new song about him on the khollywood radio station with center frequency 1 ghz the channel over which he is listening exhibits a rayleigh fading envelope and has power delay profile ac  106e 10 6  0 and doppler power spectrum sc  200 2 10 0  100 hz 0 else a the speed limit on rodeo drive is 35 km hr and the cops are always looking for superstars that are speeding so they can pull them over will kanye get a ticket b taylor's guitar creates music with a signal bandwidth of 30 khz will the music exhibit flat or frequency selective fading approximately how large a signal bandwidth would result in an irreducible error floor of 10 3 due to isi assuming bpsk modulation c kanye decides to send a text message to taylor about how much he likes the song assume the text messaging fails whenever the received signal power falls below half its average value how long on average will kanye be unable to text if the text data is sent via dpsk modulation at a data rate of 10 kbps on average how many consecutive bits will have snr below the average snr page 2 2 diversity for fun and profit and capacity gain 35 points your startup company diversityrocks is in a field trial against a competing company wireless4all you need to demonstrate to your potential customers that your system which has 2 branch mrc on its receiver works better than the competing product which has only a single antenna at its receiver you will show superiority for multiple performance criteria suppose the channel in the field trial has iid fading on each branch of your receiver the snr 1 on the first branch has a distribution p 1 5 1 4 and p 1 30 3 4 this type of distribution might arise in a channel that is heavily shadowed one quarter of the time the snr 2 on the second branch has distribution p 2 5 5 and p 2 20 5 as might arise on a channel that is shadowed will equal probability by two different objects note that the distribution on i assumes linear units for i not db your competitor only has a single branch which follows the distribution of 1 assume the channel bandwidth is b 100 khz a find the distribution on  the snr of the mrc output for your receiver b find the optimal power allocation and capacity of the channel for your system assuming both transmitter and receiver know the channel compare with the capacity of your competitor's system c find the average probability of error for dpsk modulation for your system and that of your competitor d find the outage probability of both systems assuming outage occurs when a dpsk modulated signal has a ber above 10 3 3 green cellular 35 points the premise of green cellular systems is to minimize transmit power to achieve a given performance specification if you can determine this minimum power al gore will pay you a visit and congratulate you in person for helping to save the earth your performance targets are for a cellular system with circular cells of radius r 100m that uses dpsk modulation the receiver noise within the signal bandwidth of interest is 10 12w and we ignore interference between cells assume power falloff with distance follows the model pr d pt d0 d 3 where d0 1m a for a transmit power of 10 w determine the coverage area within the cell that satisfies a ber requirement of 10 6 assuming no shadowing and no fading b compute the minimum required transmit power to meet an average ber requirement of 10 3 at the cell boundary assuming that the signal is experiencing rayleigh fading but no shadowing c compute the minimum required transmit power assuming the signal is experiencing rayleigh fading but no shadowing and the performance requirement is that for every location in the cell the instantaneous ber is less than 10 3 with probability 8 d compute the minimum required transmit power assuming the signal is experiencing rayleigh fading and log normal shadowing with std  8 and the performance requirement is that at the cell boundary the average ber is less than 10 3 with probability 95 note that q 1.6 95
