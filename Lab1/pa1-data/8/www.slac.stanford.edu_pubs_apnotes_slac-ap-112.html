slac ap 112 green functions for the radial electric component of the monopole wake field in a round resistive chamber slac slac pubs and reports slac ap 112 green functions for the radial electric component of the monopole wake field in a round resistive chamber abstract we compare different approximations to the point charge green function for the radial electric monopole field excited by an ultrarelativistic particle propagating through a resistive pipe and study the applicability of these approximations for calculating the field of a bunch with finite length it has been speculated that the exact form of the electric field could be important for simulations of the electron cloud instability in this paper we show however that the usual approximation of the green function by a delta function is adequate except for extremely short bunch lengths full text pdf slac ap 112 146 kb compressed postscript slac ap 112 63.2 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 05 apr 2001 11 07 pdt by htmlme pl
