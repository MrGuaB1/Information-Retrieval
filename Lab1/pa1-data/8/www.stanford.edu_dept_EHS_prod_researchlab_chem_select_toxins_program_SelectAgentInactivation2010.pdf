complete inactivation of different toxins page 1 complete inactivation of different toxins with a 30 minute exposure time to varying concentrations of sodium hypochlorite naoci sodium hydroxide naoh 2.5 naocl toxin 2.5 naocl 1.0 naocl 0.1 naocl 0.25 n naoh t 2 mycotoxin yes no no no brevetoxin yes yes no no microcystin yes yes yes no tetrodotoxin yes yes yes no saxitoxin yes yes yes yes palytoxin yes yes yes yes ricin yes yes yes yes botulinum yes yes yes yes seb yes yes yes yes page 2 recommendations 1 for t 2 mycotoxin and brevetoxin it is recommended that for complete inactivation all liquid samples accidental spills and nonburnable waste be soaked in 2.5 sodium hypochlorite with 0.25 n sodium hydroxide for 4 hr 2 it is further recommended that cages and bedding from animals exposed to t 2 mycotoxin or brevetoxin be exposed to 0.25 sodium hypochlorite and 0.025 n sodium hydroxide for 4 hr 3 exposure for 30 minutes to 1.0 sodium hypochlorite is an effective procedure for laboratory working solutions equipment animal cages working area and spills for inactivation of saxitoxin tetrodotoxin microcystin palytoxin ricin botulinum toxin or staphylococcal enterotoxins seb 4 all burnable waste from toxins should be incinerated at temperatures in excess of 1500o f 5 autoclaving can be used with the protein toxins ricin botulinum toxin and seb but should not be used with any of the low molecular toxins
