problem set 3 page 1 handout 11 cs103a october 3 2008 robert plummer problem set 3 due 10 8 in class this problem set is more challenging and time consuming than the previous two be sure to allocate enough time also be sure to read the instructions for each group of problems carefully for example 6.24 and 6.25 require you to turn in an informal proof as well as a formal one formal proofs 1 do you try it on p 145 151 3 153 4 2 exercises 6.5 6.6 on p 154 3 do you try it on p 160 note that this is a smaller form of the resolution principle that we discussed in class here q and q cancel out to leave us with p it's worth remembering the pattern of this proof since it will occur many times 4 exercises 6.11 6.12 6.14 on p 162 5 exercise 6.20 on p 166 6 do you try it on p 168 7 exercise 6.24 6.25 6.32 on p 172 3 8 exercise 6.33 6.35 6.40 on p 175 taut con allowed for law of excluded middle only note the file exercise 6.33 prf provides an incomplete proof as a starting point and we are happy for you to complete it as suggested in the problem however the middle part of this proof is longer than necessary we would prefer that you turn in a shorter version even though the grade grinder may say that you didn t follow the instructions
