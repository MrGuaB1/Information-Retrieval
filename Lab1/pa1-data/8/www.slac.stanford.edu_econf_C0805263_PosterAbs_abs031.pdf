unexpected nuclear effects in  fe interactions and minerva's program to measure  scattering off a range of nuclei recent stu page 1 unexpected nuclear effects in  fe interactions and minerva's program to measure  scattering off a range of nuclei recent studies of nuclear effects in  fe data by members of the cteq collaboration suggest that nuclear effects as seen by neutrinos are very different compared to those from  e fe scattering the minerva experiment will measure  a scattering off of he c fe and pb to systematically study these nuclear effects in neutrino interactions with high statistics the poster will summarize the cteq results and outline the minerva program for measuring nuclear effects
