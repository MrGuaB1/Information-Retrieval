atlas physics analysis retreat mar 07 slac b tag subgroup atlas physics analysis retreat mar 07 slac basic startup projects is a b jet a b jet examine tag and fake rates given truth as a function of pt eta and any other variable which tag performance may potentially depend on how are the charm jet doing what are vertex reconstruction resolutions like for the various taggers in particular 2d vs 3d how well is the primary vertex reconstructed track impact parameter resolution at an even more fundamental level the track impact parameter resolution for various momenta and eta can provide a very basic feel for what can be expected for b tagging performance jet flavor truth labelling what flavor one labels a jet is tricky in mc is it ab c light or tau atlas has an algorithm with a very small delta r cut between the jet axis and the meson is this appropriate this involves looking at mc truth tag rates as a function of delta r etc documentations flavor tagging working group wiki official b tagging r12 tutorial the slac copy of samples for the release 12 tutorial are located at atlroot work data1 btag tutorial b tagging session at oct 06 trigger&physics week data samples standard analysis using athena for the current release 12 tagging code the only samples esd and aod available are those for the b tag tutorial at atlroot work data1 btag tutorial the csc11 aod samples can be found from the slac dataset page b signal samples from ttbar wh h bb and tth aod samples c sample in wh h cc aod sample light flavors in qcd dijets j2 j3 j4 samples and wh h uu sample note that these csc11 samples have incompatible edm with the latest release 12 code using the san to do tagging as opposed to the aod
