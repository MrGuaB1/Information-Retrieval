introduction ying zong huang ee281 project stanford university fall 2002 wireless freeform input device home design hardware software tools links introduction simply put this project in its current form is a tilt based wireless mouse the hardware has two portions a handheld part and a base station the handheld part senses the tilt angle that it is held at via a 2d accelerometer processes the tilt data and sends it across a radio link it also has two buttons corresponding to two mouse buttons the base station which is connected to a serial port receives the radio data and sends it on to the computer at the output the system emulates a standard serial port mouse it is a inertial mode mouse which means the tilt angle corresponds to a velocity and not to an absolute position in this sense this project resembles certain gaming devices especially tilt based gamepads more than a traditional mouse but it is fit for either purpose left to right transmitter front transmitter back receiver front receiver back background i chose this project because it seems like a wireless mouse that needs no surface is something nice to have it's interesting to be a couple of feet away from the computer sit back and browse the web technically you can be 300 feet away but then you really can t see your mouse cursor i suppose this activity is more feasible on a projector there are more useful applications such as using this as a writeable laser pointer for powerpoint acknowledgment also goes to bob dougherty of the psychology department for this project idea
