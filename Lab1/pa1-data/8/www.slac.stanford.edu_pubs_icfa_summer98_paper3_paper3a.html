iib summer 98 paper no 3 a sharma properties of some gas mixtures used in tracking detectors slac journal icfa 16 3 full article comments questions & answers help iib home page abstract this report summarizes some useful data on the transport characteristics of gas mixtures which are required for detection of charged particles in gas detectors the requirements for high luminosity tracking are stringent and different at low and high momenta representing a compromise between a fast gas mixture small diffusion properties and having a small lorentz angle but high primary ionization with the advent of a host of computing programs available the transport parameters are rather well estimated and corroborated by experiment mixtures of some noble gases with popular quenchers are considered with some emphasis on low mass gases pure noble gases for example argon and xenon are also presented with single photon detection and medical imaging applications in view respectively last modified 2 july 1998 jochen
