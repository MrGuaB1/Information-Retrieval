spatial capacity of ad hoc networks page 1 spatial capacity of ad hoc networks juan blanch project proposal even though results concerning the capacity of ad hoc networks are fairly abstract rely on simple models and assume optimal conditions they can provide very useful insights to designers on one hand they give an upper bound to the achievable capacity like channel capacity for a single channel on the other hand perhaps more importantly they give an understanding of the behavior of the capacity as a function of certain parameters in this project we will try to describe the state of the art review in this field we will first examine the landmark paper 1 which determines the achievable rate for nodes in an asymptotically large ad hoc network these results have been extended in 2 to three dimensional topologies also shannon capacity has been incorporated into the model we will then turn our attention to the capacity for ad hoc networks for arbitrary networks with any number of nodes by analyzing the approach taken in 3 in that paper the capacity is determined under different transmission strategies while it allows to study their impact on capacity it remains an open problem to determine an upper bound on capacity regardless of the transmission scheme shannon capacity we will try to understand what is needed to overcome this open problem references 1 p gupta and pr kumar the capacity of wireless networks ieee transactions on information theory 46 2 march 2000 2 s stoumpis and a goldsmith ad hoc network capacity asilomar conference of signals systems and computers 2000 3 s stoumpis and a goldsmith capacity regions for wireless ad hoc networks international symposium on communication theory and applications 2001
