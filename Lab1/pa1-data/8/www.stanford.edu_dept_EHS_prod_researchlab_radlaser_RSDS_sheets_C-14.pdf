safety sheet nuclide c 14 page 1 radionuclide safety data sheet nuclide c 14 forms soluble except gaseous physical characteristics half life 5730 years type decay beta maximum energy 0.156 mev hazard category c level low hazard 0.1 to 10 mci b level moderate hazard 10 mci to 1.0 ci a level high hazard 1.0 ci external radiation hazards and shielding the maximum range of these betas is 1 ft in air and 0.0065 in 0.17 mm in glass the external hazard of this isotope is minimal eg the glass vial holding the isotope will provide sufficient shielding to stop the betas if skin is uniformly contaminated with c14 1 microcurie cm2 will deliver a dose of 1100 mrems hr to basal cells of the skin porter consultants to nrc hazards if internally deposited the alara annual limit of intake based on nrc ali which will result in a whole body exposure of 500 mrem or maximum recommended doses by the ncrp to hematopoetic or speratogonial stem cell nuclei is as follows whole body 200 ci inorganic soluble stem cell nuclei 1000 ci dna precursors stem cell nuclei 88 ci rna precursors dosimetry and bioassay requirements film badges and dosimeter rings are not appropriate for monitoring c14 exposure urine assays may be required after spills or contamination incidents special problems and precautions 1 always wear protective gloves to keep contamination from skin change gloves often 2 c14 beta particles have very low energies gm survey meters are not very efficient at such energies smear surveys required 3 all waste in a c14 work areas is considered to be contaminated keep work areas free of unnecessary items segregate wastes to those with h3 and c14 only 4 limit of soluble waste to sewer is 100 microcuries day per lab 9 97
