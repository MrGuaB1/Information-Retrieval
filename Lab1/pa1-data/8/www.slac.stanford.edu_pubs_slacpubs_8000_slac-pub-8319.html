slac pub 8319 tev strings and collider probes of large extra dimensions slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8319 tev strings and collider probes of large extra dimensions abstract arkani hamed dimopoulos and dvali have proposed that the fundamental gravitational scale is close to 1 tev and that the observed weakness of gravity at long distances is explained by the presence of large extra compact dimensions if this scenario is realized in a string theory of quantum gravity the string excited states of standard model particles will also have tev masses these states will be visible to experiment and in fact provide the first signatures of the presence of a low quantum gravity scale their presence also affects the more familiar signatures due to real and virtual graviton emission we study the effects of these states in a simple string model full text pdf slac pub 8319 479 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8319 329 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
