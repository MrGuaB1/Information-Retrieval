energy efficiency of mimo and cooperative mimo techniques in sensor networks page 1 davood shamsi ee360 energy efficiency of mimo and cooperative mimo techniques in sensor networks by shuguang cui student member ieee andrea j goldsmith senior member ieee and ahmad bahai member ieee page 2 motivation energy resources are limited in sensor networks energy efficient communication typically focus on minimizing the transmission energy mimo for the same throughput needs less transmission energy than siso mimo more circuitry page 3 energy model in sensor networks page 4 a bound for bpsk a flat rayleigh fading channel fading fixed during the transmission of each alamouti codeword consider a 2 by 1 miso page 5 the bound vs the true value page 6 transmission energy comparison page 7 total energy comparison page 8 mimo vs siso page 9 system with variable rates data is usually bursty and packet by packet suppose we have l bits to transmit and a deadline t we can transmit in t on and go to sleep mode mqam is used page 10 constellation size is important mqam is used the optimal constellation size page 11 mimo vs miso mimo power consumption is higher page 12 mimo with multi node cooperation mimo for small sensors is impractical nodes cooperate to form a virtual mimo cluster nodes and save energy of the cluster delay and local transmission page 13 system assumptions mt transmission nodes each transmitter node ni bits to transmit non cooperative mode time is slotted mqam cooperative mode first local information exchange broadcast then all transmit as a mimo page 14 energy and delay non cooperative cooperative page 15 miso vs non cooperative page 16 miso vs non cooperative page 17 mimo vs non cooperative page 18 mimo vs non cooperative page 19 another paper energy efficient virtual mimo based cooperative communications for wireless sensor networks by sudharman k jayaweera modify the model and analytical results training overhead the same results considering delay and energy page 20
