term project information and suggestions page 1 ee 360 multiuser wireless systems and networks winter 2010 goldsmith term project information and suggestions the term project will be a research project related to one of the topics covered in the course the project must include some original research that is either analysis simulation and or an experiment two people may collaborate on the project if it is of sufficient scope and the contributions of each person are clearly delineated details and deadlines a 1 2 page project proposal is due jan 22 before midnight the project proposal should include a fairly detailed description of what you plan to do specifically if you are doing an original analysis you must describe the system you are analyzing the specific aspects of the system you plan to analyze and how you plan to do the analysis if you are doing a simulation you should describe in detail the system that you plan to simulate how you plan to simulate it and what specific simulations you plan to run if you are doing an experiment you should describe in detail the experimental setup and what specific experiments on this setup you plan to do your proposal should include 2 3 references and the relevance of these references to the proposed work should be described in your proposal do not propose an overly ambitious project that cannot be completed by the end of the quarter you are strongly urged to meet with the instructor prior to the proposal deadline to get feedback on your project proposal as part of your project proposal you must create a web site for your project and post your proposal to the web site please email me and the ta your website location your site will be linked to the class homepage you will receive feedback on your project proposal within a few days of jan 22 and you must submit a revised proposal by jan 29 based on your proposal feedback your project proposal initial and revised versions will be worth 10 of the project grade the proposal grade will be based on the level of detail and clarity in your description of the proposed work as well as my assessment as to whether you can complete the proposed work in the available time a 2 3 page progress report on your project will be due feb 19 before midnight this must introduce the problem being investigated provide a detailed system description progress to date a statement of remaining work and any changes that have been made to your project from the original proposal the project progress report will be worth 15 of the project grade and must include the following 1 a clear statement of the problem being addressed 2 a detailed description of the technical approach to solving the problem 3 a detailed description of the system model 4 a detailed description of work completed and any preliminary results 5 an itemized statement of work to be completed in the remaining time 6 3 6 relevant references the project report is due on march 14 before midnight and must be posted to your project website at that time the final report should be written as if you were submitting it to a conference it should include an abstract describing your main results an introduction describing the problem being addressed and previous related work in this area a description of the system model a detailed description of the technical approach to the problem analytical and or simulation and or experimental results possible extensions to the work and final conclusions some suggested topics multiuser information theory access techniques and or routing in wireless networks dynamic resource allocation in wireless networks adaptive modulation coding in multiuser systems power control centralized or distributed space time processing mimo and or smart antennas in multiuser systems and networks multiuser multicarrier ofdm systems page 2 multiuser cdma systems interference cancellation or multiuser detection in wireless networks base station cooperation in cellular networks ad hoc wireless networks sensor networks software define radios cognitive radios multirate multimedia over wireless networks cross layer design in wireless networks
