geometrical problems newcommand ones mathbf 1 let mathcal p subset mathbf r n be a polyhedron described by a set of linear inequalities and a a point in mathbf r n are the following problems easy or hard easy means the solution can be found by solving one or a modest number of convex optimization problems find a point in mathcal p that is closest to a in euclidean norm easy correct this can be done by solving a qp hard incorrect find a point in mathcal p that is closest to a in ell_ infty norm easy correct this can be done by solving an lp hard incorrect find a point in mathcal p that is farthest from a in euclidean norm easy incorrect hard correct this problem is np hard in fact it's hard to just check whether or not mathcal p lies inside a given euclidean ball find a point in mathcal p that is farthest from a in ell_ infty norm easy correct this can be done by maximizing and minimizing each component of x subject to x in mathcal p this requires solving $2 n lps hard incorrect last updated at 2012 02 20 21 54 16 pst
