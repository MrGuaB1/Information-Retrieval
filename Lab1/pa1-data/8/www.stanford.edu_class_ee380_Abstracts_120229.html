abstract bio stanford ee computer systems colloquium 4 15pm wednesday february 29 2012 skilling auditorium stanford campus http ee380 stanford edu julia a fast dynamic language for technical computing jeff bezanson mit about the talk julia is a general purpose high level dynamic language designed from the start to take advantage of techniques for executing dynamic languages at statically compiled language speeds as a result the language has a more powerful type system and generally provides better type information to the compiler julia is especially good at running matlab and r style programs given its level of performance we envision a new era of technical computing where libraries can be developed in a high level language instead of c or fortran we have also experimented with cloud api integration and begun to develop a web based language neutral platform for visualization and collaboration the ultimate goal is to make cloud based supercomputing as easy and accessible as google docs slides there is no downloadable version of the slides for this talk available at this time about the speaker jeff bezanson has been developing the julia language for two and a half years with a small distributed team of collaborators previously he worked as a software engineer at interactive supercomputing which developed the star p parallel extension to matlab at the company jeff was a principal developer of m an implementation of the matlab language running on net he is now a second year graduate student at mit jeff received an ab in computer science from harvard university in 2004 and has experience with applications of technical computing in medical imaging contact information jeff bezanson email bezanson at mit edu
