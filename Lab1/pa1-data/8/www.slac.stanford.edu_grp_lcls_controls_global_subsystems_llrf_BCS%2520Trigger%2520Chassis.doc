bcs trigger chassis bcs trigger chassis v1 2 august 30 2006 the proposed chassis will consist of two pcbs run off a single 5vdc power supply one pcb will provide triggers for the rf gun 20 6 and the other pcb will provide triggers for 20 5 20 7 20 8 21 1 and 21 2 each pcb will take four 24v bcs signal s in through isolated bnc connectors from the rear chassis panel the ps2505l 1 photocoupler will be used to isolate the bcs inputs each pcb will also provide eight accelerate or standby trigger s to be used by phase and amplitude controller s accelerate or standby state will be determined by the state of the bcs permit s all logic will be done inside a xilinx cpld the timing for the accelerate trigger will be determined from the input trigger the standby trigger timing will be generated by counting a preset number of 119mhz clock pulses past the accelerate trigger the cpld programming will be done through a jtag port located on the pcb and accessible on ly by removal of the chassis cover phasing of the input trigger to the clock wi ll need to be done in 2ns steps by cable length each pcb will have 15 bnc connectors on it the chassis rear panel will have 30 bnc connectors and a 110vac power input module the front panel will have the chassis name number and a power led the below diagram shows the sub booster timing using two triggers no clock and bcs signal this eliminates the clock to trigger phasing a trigger for bcs and the bcs permit is used to generate a bcs window the bcs window and an accelerate standby trigger are anded to generate the solid state sub booster sssb trigger in order for this to work the timing system needs to be able to generate a trigger that can shift timing based on accelerate standby and bcs state 100ns jitter in bcs window timing from use of 10mhz local clock should be acceptable
