there are two data sets here resphantom2 mat 3t_coronary mat the resolution phantom is a great data set to start with the off resonance blurring is easy to see and the two data sets align exactly the coronary data set is more challenging the two data sets are shifted by about a pixel which complicates computing a high resolution map in each case the matlab variables are d1 data for echo time 1 d2 data for echo time 2 te1 echo time 1 te2 echo time 2 k k space trajectory w weighting the weighting is an analytic approximation you may want to compute the voronoi weighting the sampling time is 4 us for each the phantom data should be reconstructed as a 160x160 pixel image and the coronary data as a 400x400 pixel image example coronary reconstructions are included in that data set
