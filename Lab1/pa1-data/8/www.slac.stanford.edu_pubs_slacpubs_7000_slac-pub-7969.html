slac pub 7969 final focus systems in linear colliders slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7969 final focus systems in linear colliders abstract in colliding beam facilities the final focus system must demagnify the beams to attain the very small spot sizes required at the interaction points the first final focus system with local chromatic correction was developed for the stanford linear collider where very large demagnifications were desired this same conceptual design has been adopted by all the future linear collider designs as well as the superconducting supercollider the stanford and kek b factories and the proposed muon collider in this paper the over all layout physics constraints and optimization techniques relevant to the design of final focus systems for high energy electron positron linear colliders are reviewed finally advanced concepts to avoid some of the limitations of these systems are discussed full text pdf slac pub 7969 297 kb compressed postscript slac pub 7969 370 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
