search for proton decays via p e 0 and p  0 in super kamiokande abstract page 1 search for proton decays via p e+0 and p  0 in super kamiokande h nishino for the super kamiokande collaboration institute for cosmic ray research university of tokyo abstract we have searched for proton decays via p e+0 and p  0 using data from a 91.7 kton year exposure of super kamiokande i and a 49.2 kton year exposure of super kamiokande ii super kamiokande ii has comparable performances with super kamiokande i for the proton decays search even with a half density of photomultiplier tubes no candidate events are observed with expected backgrounds induced by atmospheric neutrinos of 0.3 events for both decay modes from these results we set the most stringent lower limits on the partial lifetime at a 90 confidence level 1
