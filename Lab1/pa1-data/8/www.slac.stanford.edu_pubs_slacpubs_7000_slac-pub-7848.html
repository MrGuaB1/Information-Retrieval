slac pub 7848 switched matrix accelerator slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7848 switched matrix accelerator abstract we describe a new concept for a microwave circuit functioning as a charged particle accelerator at mm wavelengths permitting an accelerating gradient higher than conventional passive circuits can withstand consistent with cyclic fatigue the device provides acceleration for multiple bunches in parallel channels and permits a short exposure time for the conducting surface of the accelerating cavities our analysis includes scalings based on a smooth transmission line model and a complementary treatment with a coupled cavity simulation we provide also an electromagnetic design for the accelerating structure arriving at rough dimensions for a seven cell accelerator matched to standard waveguide and suitable for bench tests at low power in air at 91.392 ghz a critical element in the concept is a fast mm wave switch suitable for operation at high power and we present the considerations for implementation in an h plane tee we discuss the use of diamond as the photoconductor switch medium full text pdf slac pub 7848 910 kb compressed postscript slac pub 7848 1.18 mb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
