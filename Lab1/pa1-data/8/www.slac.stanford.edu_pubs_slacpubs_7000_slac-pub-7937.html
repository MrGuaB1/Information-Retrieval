slac pub 7937 renormalization of supersymmetric theories slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7937 renormalization of supersymmetric theories abstract we review the renormalization of the electroweak sector of the standard model the derivation also applies to the minimal supersymmetric standard model we discuss regularization and the relation between the threshold corrections and the renormalization group equations we consider the corrections to many precision observables including m w and sin 2 theta eff we show that global ts to the data exclude regions of supersymmetric model parameter space and lead to lower bounds on superpartner masses full text pdf slac pub 7937 603 kb compressed postscript slac pub 7937 247 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
