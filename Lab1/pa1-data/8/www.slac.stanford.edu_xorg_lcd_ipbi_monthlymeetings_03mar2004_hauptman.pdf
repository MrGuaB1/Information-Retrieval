outline of lcws talk on forward calorimeters page 1 1 outline of lcws talk on forward calorimeters john hauptman fiber cerenkov a proven technology on the hadronic forward hf calorimeter for cms effort led my one of our lc collabo rators nural akchurin quartz fibers drop to 25 transmission after 1 grad time dispersion is up to 1 ns maybe ok si tungsten will surely work but serious questions of survival under a grad dose are unanswered not only si but associated electronics in the radiation field question of recovery time between bunch crossings gas cerenkov fast enough and presumably radiation hard not proven and problems of metallic reflectivity are not yet solved need optical transport to protected photodetectors it is essential that any forward calorimeter be directly and brutally tested in the proposed slac a line end station a beam then i would go into more technical depth on each option in partic ular the calculated performance of the sw and gas cerenkov options using maruyama's input events per bunch crossing using whatever results are available at the time guesswork on the radiation survivability of siw and quartz fibers consequences of time spread importance of bunch by bunch mea surements for early machine understanding page 2 2 included in the first item above will be some recent work on gas cerenkov to ameliorate the extraordinary burden of 200 tev of pairs per bunch crossing there are two handles 1 use a gas with lower index of refraction to raise the cerenkov thresh old cost is lower light yield 2 put a few radiation lengths of w in front why not instrument with a little si too to force early conversions and therefore a larger fraction of the electrons will fall below cerenkov threshold a siw absorber will aid the energy measurement of the cerenkov calorimeter by measuring the x y coordinates of conversions but will not suffer the radiation damage incurred at shower maximum pile up over many bunches is ok maybe
