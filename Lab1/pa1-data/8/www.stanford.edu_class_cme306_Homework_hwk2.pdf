arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale methods page 1 cme306 cs205b homework 2 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale methods recall from homework that we derived the weak form of conservation of mass in eulerian form to be t  dv   u da 0 1 where  a control volume remains fixed in time in lagrangian methods we instead move  and ignore the flux across the boundary ale methods make no such assumption and instead we take the change in time of the boundary to be  t v u 1 please re derive the weak form of conservation of mass this time in ale form that is the control volume  is moving at some speed v which is not the fluid velocity u remember that conservation of mass describes the change in mass of a control volume so t should not be under the volume integral 2 write down the strong form of conservation of mass in ale form 1 page 2 runge kutta methods recall the model ordinary differential equation y y can be discretized and solved in a variety of ways a popular family of methods are referred to as rk or runge kutta methods you may recall that the first order rk method is equivalent to forward differencing yi 1 yi xyi these methods can be expressed generally as yi 1 gyi and are stable when g 1 this gives a condition on x for stability 1 tvd define the total variation of v as tv v n j 1 vj 1 vj 2 and prove that 2nd order runge kutta is total variation diminishing tvd in the sense that tv vn 1 tv vn you should assume that forward euler is tvd recall that 2nd order runge kutta is given to be y 1 x yi y 1 x y yi 1 yi y 2 3 2 note that  in general can be complex and find the stability condition for 2nd order runge kutta 2 page 3 lax richtmyer theorem prove that stability and consistency are sufficient for convergence for a linear scheme 3
