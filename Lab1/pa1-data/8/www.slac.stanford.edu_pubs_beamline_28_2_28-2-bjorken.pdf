foreword page 1 idney drell and slac have histories which are inseparable right from the beginning when slac was no more than project m housed in a warehouse on the stanford campus sid left the more familiar and comfort able world of academe to join the adventure of cre ating a great new laboratory a major challenge he faced as a theorist was to create the kind of intel lectual climate more typically found in university departments and in those days not commonly found within this country's accelerator laborato ries this turned into an incredible success story quickly the slac theory group became very well known not only for the variety of talent it attracted but especially for its unique personality to this day this personality persists uncompro misingly high intellectual standards a good mix of applied and formal theory a close interaction with the experimental community a breadth of vision an essential humanism and an informality and lack of pretension which keeps the pursuit of physics something not only deeply satisfying but also just plain fun to do it is no accident that this slac style is a mirror of sid's own persona generations of students and postdocs who have passed through the laboratory such as john ellis of cern who discusses future options for particle physics in this issue as well as we old timers will attest to his overwhelming influence in creat ing this environment sid's research contributions within and beyond the slac program have been legion and broad ranging of fundamental importance and his impact on slac has extended well beyond that of theoretical physics from the beginning of slac he was invaluable in the building of the laboratory its staff and its program he has as deputy director played a quiet but vital role in the overall management and orchestration of the slac program his calm guidance based on the highest scien tific standards an unwavering integrity and an astute understanding of human nature has been in most demand in just those periods of slac history that have been the most stressful and his wise counsel is always sought by the international particle physics community on how to deal with the broad issues facing the field 2 summer 1998 foreword s page 2 beam line 3 but sid s influence has extended far beyond particle physics in a real sense to the entire planet as he himself recounts in this issue he was drawn into the public policy issues of strategic defense and arms control already in the 1960s and his credo and contributions can better be dis cerned by his own words than by any of mine making headway on political and social issues is much slower going than on physics and sid's modus operandi has been to patiently work from the inside a method which was strongly challenged during the vietnam years sid confronted personally at that time responded with steadfastness and great integrity he exemplifies for everyone the value and necessity of his form of public service one small expression of his influence is that some of his students and other physicists passing through the slac environment have chosen to move their careers out of physics and into public affairs quite a few others while staying within physics have been especially active in the social issues created by the big science character of particle physics then there is sid s impact on me i first encountered sid as an undergraduate at mit where he taught courses i took and in addi tion sponsored evening informal journal club seminars for under graduate physics majors in his home we happened to emigrate to stanford together in 1956 he on the faculty i as a graduate student i soon was priv ileged to be one of his many thesis students something which then evolved into writing our textbooks it was absolutely natural that i too should join slac and to continue the close association sid has been everything to me as a teacher and mentor as a second father as an esteemed colleague as best man and as simply a dear friend sid it is a time for warm congratu lations on your long and distinguished career at slac and for best wishes for many happy retirement years years which we at slac trust will continue to be shared with us james bjorken
