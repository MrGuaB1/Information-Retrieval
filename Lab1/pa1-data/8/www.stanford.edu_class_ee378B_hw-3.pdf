operator norm refresher page 1 ee378b statistical signal processing operator norm refresher andrea montanari lecture 5 6 due on 4 19 2011 this homework aims at making you familiar with matrix norms in particular with the l2 operator norm remember that the operator norm of m rm n is defined as m2 max mx2 x2 1 1 where for a vector x rn x2 n i 1 x2 i 1 2 1 prove that the operator norm admits the following alternative characterizations m2 max x m y x2 y2 1 1 m where 1 m 2 m n m are the singular values of m 2 prove that m2 m 2 and ab2 a2 b2 3 prove that 2 is indeed a norm ie that it satisfies the following properties i am2 a m2 for any scalar a ii a b2 a2 b2 iii if m2 0 then m 0 4 prove the following upper and lower bounds m2 m max i m n j 1 m2 ij 1 2 m2 1 mn m i 1 n j 1 mij give examples for which these bounds are tight ie matrices such that the above bounds are satisfied with equality 5 recall that the frobenius norm of a matrix is defined as mf m i 1 n j 1 m2 ij 1 2 prove that mf min m n i 1 i m 2 1 2 deduce that m2 mf rank m m2
