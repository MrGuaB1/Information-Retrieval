slac's network service level expectations lan slac's network service level expectations last update september 3 1996 slac the lab index phone dir network group to set realistic expectations we are developing a set of metrics to identify the expected and actual performance of the network response time for on site network layer 10 msec for 95 of the samples measured by pinging on a regular basis sub second response for the majority of trivial network service requests eg a name service request font service better than 0.25 sec response to 95 of the ethernet requests for the slac web detailed page this only includes the network and server time it does not include the time for the browser to render the page we monitor this every 15 minutes from peleus which is one router hop from the www server network reachability of 99 measured by the decmsu network monitoring system 95 of trivial mail not forwarded or rerouted not involving slacvm and 10 kbytes item is delivered on site within 10 minutes we monitor and keep track of many of the network components and services by setting thresholds on various measurements or combinations of measurements we are better able to be alerted to when there may be troubles in meeting the expectations les cottrell feedback reporting problems
