reservoirs vectors transmission reservoirs in most cases myiasis causing flies are not required to lay eggs in a particular host even if it is commonly associated with that host eg human botfly ox warble as a result many domestic and wild animals can serve as reservoirs in particular farm mammals such as sheep cows and horses are frequent reservoirs and targets of maggot infestation this creates significant economic losses and makes control of the parasites much more difficult rats are the primary reservoir for tumbu fly cordylobia anthropophaga maggots in the wild but around civilization dogs and people become the common hosts 6 vectors usually the female fly directly lays its eggs onto the host so there is no vector one notable exception is the human botfly dermatobia hominis the female fly in mid air will grasp onto a mosquito or another blood sucking insect and deposit eggs on its abdomen the vector then releases the eggs into the host when it takes a blood meal ticks have also been shown to carry d hominis eggs 5 6 transmission there are other modes of transmission besides simply the deposition of eggs on exposed often wounded tissue 5 6 bites from blood sucking insects as in the case of d hominis ingestion of eggs with or without contaminated food some species of sarcophaga lay eggs on meat or fruit eggs could also be deposited on the lips or within the mouth inhalation through the nose penetration through the skin eggs can also access the body through the eyes nose and genitourinary openings contact or proximity to fly eggs in manure or rotting animal matter
