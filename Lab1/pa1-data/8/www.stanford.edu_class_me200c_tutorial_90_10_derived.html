fortran 90 tutorial 10 derived data types a useful feature in fortran 90 is the ability to define derived data types this feature is similar to the structure feature of the c programming language the manner in which one defines and uses a derived data type is best illustrated through example type point real x y end type point type circle type point center real radius end type circle type circle c this declares the variable c to be of type circle c formally has two components the first component circle is itself a derived data type consisting of two real components called x and y the second component of c is a variable named radius of type real the variable c may be assigned a value in either of these ways c circle point 0 0 1 or equivalently c center x 0 c center y 0 c radius 1 in both cases the circle c was assigned the center point 0 0 and given the radius 1 the unit circle there are many practical uses for derived data types and these data types function just like any other variable in a program unit namely they may be initialized modified and even passed to subprograms as parameters copyright 1996 7 by stanford university all rights reserved
