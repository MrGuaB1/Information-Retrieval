safety data sheet nuclide ni 63 page 1 radionuclide safety data sheet nuclide ni 63 forms soluble physical characteristics half life 96 years type decay beta maximum energies beta 0.0659 mev energies of photons intensity d no photons hazard category c level low hazard 010 to 1.0 mci b level moderate hazard 1.0 mci to 100 mci a level high hazard greater than 100 mci external radiation hazards and shielding the beta dose is not a significant problem because the maximum range of the betas in air is only 2.14 inches the maximum ranges of the various beta particles in various materials is as follows air 2.14 inches water 0.0026 inches polyethylene 0.0024 inches disposable gloves will totally stop the beta particles hazards if internally deposited internal deposition is more of a hazard with this nuclide than the external dose gloves and periodic monitoring using smears while working are important the campus maximum permissible body burden for this nuclide based upon 10 of the dose limit to bone is 20 uci the annual limit of intake is 82 uci via inhalation of vapors dosimetry and bioassay requirements film badges and finger dosimeters are not useful for monitoring beta radiations for ni63 urine assays may be required after spills or contamination incidents special problems and precautions 1 always wear protective gloves to keep contamination from skin change gloves often 2 survey work areas at conclusion of work smear surveys are required 3 segregate wastes to those with half lives of greater than days but not with h3 and or c14 4 limit of soluble waste to sewer to 10 microcuries day per lab 6 90
