e144 acknowledgments the e144 collaboration wishes to express its sincere thanks to all of the people who through a wide variety of efforts made this experiment possible penny berridge university of tennessee physics department penny built and tested all of the silicon tungsten calorimeters used in the experiment these calorimeters were used to measure the electron positron and gamma energies the particles you see in the animation at the top of the e144 home page the university of tennessee physics department electronics shop paul cummins brad gardner and gene mcguire each worked on cabling construction for the calorimeters the university of tennessee physics department machine shop ricky huffstetler randy mcmillan jodie millward alvin peak and frank spencer worked on the mechanical components of the calorimeters and support systems the princeton high energy physics mechanical group bills sands designed the ccd mounting and vacuum boxes which were constructed by bill groom bob klemmer and alan nelson the princeton high energy physics electronics group bob wixted worked with eric prebys on the design of the ccd readout boards stan chidzik joined in the production and test of the boards carl bopp and dick rabberman dealt with numerous cabling fabrications princeton u undergraduates who helped with data collection and analysis katherine canning and david strozzi rick iverson as well as the main control operators at the stanford linear accelerator center for their endless hours of dedication in the planning and execution of providing e144 with high energy electrons to conduct the experiment
