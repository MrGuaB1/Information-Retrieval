slac pub 9560 igrid2002 demonstration bandwidth from the low lands slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 9560 igrid2002 demonstration bandwidth from the low lands abstract we report on a demonstration of several complementary high performance end to end active network throughput measurement tools these include the pingworld java applet that displays the round trip time rtt and losses to sites around the world from the user's host the multi path analysis tool that visualizes common paths from traceroutes to selected hosts the iepm high performance bandwidth monitoring toolkit which gives achievable throughput for several types of tcp data transfer applications and the available bandwidth estimation abwe tool that reports in real time the available bandwidth to several paths within the range from mbits s to gbit s we also demonstrated sending high speed data from 4 hosts at igrid2002 to over 30 hosts in 10 countries to simulate a high energy physics experiment distributing data to collaborators the demonstration utilized the high speed long latency trans atlantic network set up for igrid2002 in amsterdam during september 2002 index terms igrid2002 high throughput measurement tools monitoring networks tuning tcp full text pdf slac pub 9560 598 kb compressed postscript slac pub 9560 735 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 22 apr 2003 15 39 pdt by htmlme pl
