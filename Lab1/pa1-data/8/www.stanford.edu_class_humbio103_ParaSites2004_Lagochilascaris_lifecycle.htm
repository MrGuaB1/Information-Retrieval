untitled document lagochilascaris life cycle the life cycle of this uncommon parasite is still unclear largely because all developmental stages of the parasite egg larva and adult worm are found in lesions on infected host many experiments have been done to demonstrate the heteroxenic life cycle orally innoculating wild rodents with infecting eggs while domestic cats were fed carcasses of infected rodents these experiments show that existence of the parasite first in wild rodents is necessary for development of the disease lagochilascariasis in the intermediate host conclusions drawn wild rodents feed on eggs found in the soil infective eggs develop into larval stages of the parasite in the gut wall of wild rodents larvae travel to the liver and lungs larvae encapsulate in the skeletal muscle adipose tissue and subcutaneous connective tissues ingestion of 3rd stage infective larvae by definitive host 3rd stage larvae hatch from nodules in the stomach migration to the upper part of the digestive tracts developing to the mature stage in the rhinopharynx tissues soft palate tonsil pharynx tracha esophagus cervical lymphnodes mastoid middle ear and nasal sinus bilateral tonsil lesion from a cat inoculated with 70 larva l3 of l minor formerly encysted in tissues of wild rodent d agouti paco 1999 fertile eggs can be expelled in the feces when abscesses have developed a fistula abnormal opening to the lumen of the digestive tract simplified life cycle created by dominique suarez human innoculation period unclear lack of information and knowledge of l minor
