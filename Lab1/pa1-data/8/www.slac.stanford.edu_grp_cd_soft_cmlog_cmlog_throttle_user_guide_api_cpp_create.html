c++ filter creation & installation next c++ throttle setup up c++ api previous apis c++ filter creation & installation there are three types of cmlogfilters null jlab and slac you can declare a new filter in c++ by using the following format cmlogfilternull filter new cmlogfilternull cmlogfilterjlab filter new cmlogfilterjlab cmlogfilterslac filter new cmlogfilterslac these calls create a new filter of the specified type null jlab or slac a pointer to the filter object is returned this pointer should be passed to the setfilter function described below and should be saved by the application for making later calls to throttle functions cmlogfilter cmlogclient setfilter cmlogfilter filter this function takes a pointer obtained from one of the filter creation calls described above and installs the filter in the cmlog client all subsequent cmlog messages will be run through this filter any previous filter is removed from the system if no call to setfilter is made the cmlog client will use the default jlab filter although cmlogclient setfilter is declared to take an argument of type cmlogfilter pointers to any of the above filters will be accepted as they are all derived from cmlogfilter this function returns its argument thus filter creation & installation may be combined into one statement cmlogfilterslac filter client setfilter new cmlogfilterslac james silva 2002 10 28
