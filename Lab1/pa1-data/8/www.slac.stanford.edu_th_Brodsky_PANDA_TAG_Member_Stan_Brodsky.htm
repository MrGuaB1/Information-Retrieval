panda tag member stan brodsky stan brodsky main research interests i am interested in virtually all areas of perturbative and nonperturbative qcd especially novel hadronic and nuclear phenomenology this includes many topics that can be tested at panda gsi in anti proton interactions such as intrinsic charm effects color transparency non universal antishadowing novel quarkonium phenomena anomalous angular distributions in lepton pair production single spin asymmetries diffraction exclusive channels commensurate scale relations and anomalous higher twist effects ads qcd and light front holography can now be used to predict hadronic wavefunctions and the qcd coupling in the nonpertubative domain this should lead to new research possibilities and new predictions that can be tested at panda gsi several of my recent talks discuss details of these qcd tests at panda and the underlying theory http www slac stanford edu grp th lectures chile_10lfh_sjb1 pdf panda workshop turin italy novel anti proton qcd physicsand new insights from ads qcd part 1 part 2 part 3 june 17 2009 gsi fair workshop prerow germany novel qcd and nuclear physics at fair october 11 2009 high energy physics in the lhc era third international workshop universidad tecnica federico santa maria valparaiso chile light front holography new approximation to qcd part 1 part 2 january 4 8 2010 high energy physics in the lhc era third international workshop universidad tecnica federico santa maria valparaiso chile the conformal template for qcd january 4 8 2010 institute for nuclear theory university of washington seattle wa workshop on hadron phenomenology ads qcd and novel qcd phenomena part 1 part 2 november 10 2009 from particles and partons to nuclei and fields an international workshop and symposium in celebration of al mueller's 70th birthday columbia university new york spires conf num c09 10 23 new horizons in qcd part 1 part 2 october 23 2009 my talks are all posted here
