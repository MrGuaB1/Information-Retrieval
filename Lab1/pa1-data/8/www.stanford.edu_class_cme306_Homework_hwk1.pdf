conservation of mass eulerian framework page 1 cme306 cs205b homework 1 theory conservation of mass eulerian framework 1 in an eulerian framework the strong form of conservation of mass takes the form below please briefly explain the three nonzero terms in the equation t ux ux 0 1 2 if we are working with a discontinuous density field or velocity field ie either x or ux don t exist somewhere in the domain we cannot use the strong form of conservation of mass we can however apply the weak form which describes how mass changes in a control volume  here mass is given as  dv please derive the weak form equation for conservation of mass from the strong form note that the weak form should have no spatial derivatives 1 page 2 3 in an eulerian framework the graphs of  and u in the plots below describe the state of a system does  increase decrease or stay the same at the sample point y0 for each system you may assume all quantities here are positive  u y0 a system 1  u y0 b system 2  u y0 c system 3  u y0 d system 4 2 page 3 convergence analysis consider the wave equation ut aux 0 where a constant establish whether or not the following methods for solving the equation converge if so what are the conditions for convergence hint use the lax richtmyer equivalence theorem chapters 1 and 2 of the text by strikwerda will be helpful in addition to the discussion notes provided online note that d+ i i 1 i x and d  i i i 1 x 1 explicit central differencing vn 1 j v n j t a vn j 1 v n j 1 2 x 0 2 implicit central differencing vn 1 j v n j t a vn 1 j 1 v n 1 j 1 2 x 0 3 upwinding vn 1 j v n j t ad vn j 0 if a 0 d d if a 0 d d+ 4 downwinding vn 1 j v n j t ad vn j 0 if a 0 d d+ if a 0 d d 3
