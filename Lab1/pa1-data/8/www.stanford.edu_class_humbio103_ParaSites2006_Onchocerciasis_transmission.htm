untitled document transmission onchocerca volvulus is transmitted by the simulium the blackfly or buffalo gnat when the female simuliid takes a blood meal the skin is stretched by its apical teach and cut by its mandibles forming a pool of blood when an infected individual is bitten l1 larva in the blood are pumped into the simuliid after ten days the larva have developed into infective l3 larvae and are transmitted to a new person via salvia when the simuliid takes its next blood meal the adult simuliids live about 4 weeks in order to actually develop onchocerciasis an individual usually needs hundreds of bites from infected flies 6 14 38 55 53 54 simulium species there are at least 15 species of simulium that transmit o volvulus these are some of the most important and the regions in which they are located 14 s damnasum african savanna one of the most important vectors travels long distances s neavei uganda tanzania ethiopia and the congo restricted range s albivirgulatum congo river basin s sirbanum african savanah s ochraceum central and south america s metallicum central and south america s exiguum central and south america s guianense amazon s incrustatum amazon vector habitat nearness to rivers can eat the eyes african proverb 38 simulium are found near rivers and streams where the rapid flow provides well oxygenated water necessary for development this obligatory aquatic stage of development usually occurs on rocks or vegetation just below the surface and lasts about 10 days different species are limited to specific environments such as savannah or forest the adult flies of some species stay relatively localized while others can travel long distances deforestation in africa is altering the ecosystem in many simulium habitats thus the vector distribution is changing 38 55 agumatsa falls ghana ideal black fly breeding site 56 reservoir there are zoofillic forms of onchocerciasis but there are no non human reservoirs for o volvulus 7 55
