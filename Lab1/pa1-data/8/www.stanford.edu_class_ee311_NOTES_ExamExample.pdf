ee 311 spring 1999 solution to the midterm exam page 1 1 ee 311 spring 1999 solution to the midterm exam 1 in an mos transistor a 3 nm thick gate sio2 is replaced by a 30 nm thick hypothetical dielectric with same band gap as that of sio2 but 10 times its k under constant current gate injection which transistor will give lower qbd assume same energy is required to create damage in both materials page 2 2 2 thermal oxidation of a pointed si wedge shown below is done sketch the shape of the grown oxide and remaining si as a function of a oxidation time short and long b oxidation temperature low and high page 3 3 3 trench isolation is used for a cmos product the trench is filled in one case with solid sio2 and in the other case with a porous dielectric with lots of microvoids but with an ultrathin layer of sio2 at the trench surface as shown in the figure below which structure will give lower transistor leakage realizing that the transistor fabrication will require several thermal cycles page 4 4 4 the figure below shows an ideal and a realistic ptsi contact to si doped with arsenic to the solid solubility limit the latter case results due to si consumption which structure will give lower contact resistance if we assume that dopant segregates into si during the silicide formation
