slac pub 7958 nonlinear resonant collimation for future linear colliders slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7958 nonlinear resonant collimation for future linear colliders abstract we present a scheme for collimating large amplitude particles in the main linacs of a linear collider by adding octupoles to the fodo lattice of the linac the requirements on downstream collimation can in this way be greatly reduced or perhaps even eliminated an analytic estimate of the amplitude at which particles are lost is made by calculating the separatrix of the fourth order resonance and is in good agreement with the results of simulations simulations of particle distributions in the beam core and halo are presented as well as alignment tolerances for the octupoles full text pdf slac pub 7958 340 kb compressed postscript slac pub 7958 298 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
