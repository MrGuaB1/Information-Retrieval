untitled document anisakiasis reservoir and transmission reservoirs there is no single reservoir for anisakiasis an explanation of the various hosts will help to understand where the parasite resides during its life cycle definitive host the definitive hosts of the anisakid nematode are marine mammals once marine mammals injest the fish that are infected with the anisakid larvae the larvae mature to adults in the gut of whale dolphin seal etc in the gut the adults reproduce and eggs are passed in the mammal feces into the water intermediate host the intermediate hosts are crustaceans and fish crustaceans injest the newly hatched larvae l2 stage non infective here the larvae can mature into l3 stage infective fish eat crustaceans that have either l2 or l3 stage in the fish the l2 larvae can mature to the l3 stage both fish and crustaceans act as hosts for the larvae to change stages transient paratenic host fish can also act as a transient or paratenic hosts here the larvae grow and mature but do not differentiate into different infective stages thus the anisakiid larvae in the paratenic hosts are at the infective l3 stage incidental host humans are incidental hosts human infection results from the consumption of raw fish that are infected with l3 larvae the larvae make their way to the small intestine and gut causing gastrointestinal tract disturbances and infections however humans are a dead end for the parasite life cycle the larvae cannot mature to adulthood and reproduce in humans transmission see incidental host above
