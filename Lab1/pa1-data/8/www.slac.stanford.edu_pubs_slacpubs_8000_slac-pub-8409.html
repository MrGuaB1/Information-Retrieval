slac pub 8409 pulsed rf breakdown studies slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8409 pulsed rf breakdown studies abstract a series of experiments have been conducted to investigate the critical mechanisms involved in pulsed rf breakdown this research has examined fundamental issues such as microparticle contamination grain boundaries residual gas pulse duration field emission and the spatial distribution of plasma during a breakdown event the motivation of this research is to gain a clearer understanding of the processes involved in breakdown and to determine methods to increase the breakdown threshold thereby increasing the available power in high power microwave sources and accelerator components keywords breakdown field emission grain boundaries x rays microparticles surface plasma rf processing full text pdf slac pub 8409 788 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8409 517 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
