radionuclide safety data sheet nuclide am 241 forms soluble page 1 radionuclide safety data sheet nuclide am 241 forms soluble physical characteristics half life 432.2 years type decay alpha gamma energies alpha 5.49 mev 85 gamma 0.059 mev 36 hazard category c level low hazard 0001 to 0.01 mci b level moderate hazard 0.01 mci to 1.0 mci a level high hazard greater than 1.0 mci external radiation hazards and shielding the gamma exposure constant is approximately 1.3 r cm2 mci hr the amount of lead necessary to reduce the exposure by a factor of ten is 0.03 mm hazards if internally deposited this is a highly radiotoxic material the principal hazard from am 241 occurs if the material is allowed into one's body the campus annual limit of intake oral based upon 10 of maximum permissible is 0.035 uci the campus ali for inhalation is 0.00054 microcuries also based upon 10 dose of the maximum permissible dosimetry and bioassay requirements urine assays will be required after spills or contamination incidents involving more than 0.1 microcuries special problems and precautions 1 work in a fume hood to capture any dusts 2 always wear protective gloves to keep contamination from skin change gloves often 3 always survey work areas at conclusion of work perform documented surveys monthly smear surveys are required though the nai scintillation probe can detect gross contamination 4 segregate wastes to those with half lives of greater than 90 days but not with h3 and or c14 wrap dry wastes to minimize dust information 5 limit soluble waste to sewer to 0.01 microcuries day per lab generally solidify liquid wastes in cement kits 10 90
