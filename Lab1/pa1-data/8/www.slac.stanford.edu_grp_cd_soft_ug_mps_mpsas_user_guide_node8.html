beam configuration overlay next up previous contents next running the simulation up simulation of a previous operand equality configuration overlay beam configuration overlay once an ap and an algorithm has been selected any number of relevant beam groups and rate limiting kinds can be made active or inactive for the upcoming simulation all beam groups and rate limiting kinds are initialized to the active state except for the null beam group this configuration can be returned at any time by pressing the beam init button to toggle the activity of beam groups or rate limiting kinds for the simulation to follow simply select the ones in either list that you wish to toggle you can save beam configurations to a file of your choice and load them from a file of your choice using the same buttons and windows used in the operand equality overlay to manipulate files of device configurations the save to file and get from file buttons function the same as they do in the operand equality overlay once all the beam settings are configured as desired you can pop down the beam configuration overlay and work on other overlays and panels slac controls software fri nov 4 11 56 07 pst 1994
