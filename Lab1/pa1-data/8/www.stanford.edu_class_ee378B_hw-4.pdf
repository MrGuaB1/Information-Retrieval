community detection via spectral methods page 1 ee378b statistical signal processing community detection via spectral methods andrea montanari lecture 7 8 due on 4 26 2011 this homework is on community detection in a real world network namely general relativity and quan tum cosmology grqc category in the arxiv the data are available at www stanford edu class ee378b ca grqc txt and were downloaded from snap a network datasets archive mantained at stanford by jure leskovec the data concerns the coauthorship graph an edge joins author i to author j if i and j coau thored a paper the graph is undirected but the data file is in short format for every edge i j it includes both the ordered pair i j and the ordered pair j i 1 implement the community detection algorithm discussed in class this approximately maximizes mod ularity via spectral relaxation for further reference you can consult the paper by mej newman modularity and community structure in networks 2 use the algorithm to infer the community structure of the grqc coauthorship graph
