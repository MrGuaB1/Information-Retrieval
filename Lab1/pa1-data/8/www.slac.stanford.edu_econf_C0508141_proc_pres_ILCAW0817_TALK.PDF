q9 positron predamping ring no page 1 q9 positron predamping ring no john sheppard on behalf of jim clarke masao kuriki philippe piot and all the contributors to wg3a snowmass colorado august 23 2005 page 2 q9 is a positron predamping ring required damping ring acceptance all particles at the entrance of the damping ring should satisfy a x a y 0.09 m rad  0.5 where a x  x x2 2 x xp x  x p x 2 ie the transverse acceptance involves a triangular cut and the full width energy acceptance is 1 this is the acceptance discussed between wg3a and wg3b on august 22 2005 this value has been adopted by wg3b no positron predamping ring is required if the acceptances are reduced then this question should be revisited page 3 ilc source requirements all 3 proposals meet design intensity specs conv needs replacement for polarization parameter symbol value units particles per bunch b n 10 2 10 x 10 1 10 x e bunches per pulse b n 2820 5600 number bunch spacing tb 300 150 ns pulse repetition rate rep f 5 hz energy e0 5 gev dr transverse acceptance a 2j 0.09 m rad dr energy acceptance e e 1 fw overhead factor fc 1.5 number positron polarization option pp 60 lo q parameters
