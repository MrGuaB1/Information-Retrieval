upgrading the 3d in bubble chamber wd walker duke university rk yamamoto massachusetts institute of technology since the page 1 259 upgrading the 3d in bubble chamber wd walker duke university rk yamamoto massachusetts institute of technology since the 3d in bubble chamber was constructed in 1960 1963 technology has changed remarkably we propose a step by step program for the improvement of the 3d in system the first step has to do with making the magnet superconducting this would obviously require he refrigeration the second step would be to increase the cooling of the chamber to make higher cycling rates feasible this would probably best be done by using the same he refrigeration system as for the magnet this is highly desirable from a safety point of view in that it would eliminate the high pressure hydrogen with its associated compressors which are now 25 years old the third step would be to monitor the operation of the bubble chamber with a small computer at first the computer could simply record the operation of the bubble chamber by degrees one could introduce feedback loops to control refrigeration and expansion functions the effect of these changes would be such as to decrease the crew size one might then consider consolidating the controls for the chamber with those for the is ft undoubtedly the user community would be interested in aiding in the designing and building of such a monitoring and control system the evolution of the system would be such as to produce page 2 260 a safer system which would require more user help in running the system and probably considerably smaller laboratory crews
