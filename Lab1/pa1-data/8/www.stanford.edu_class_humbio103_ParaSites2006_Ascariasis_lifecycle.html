untitled document life cycle courtesy of http www dpd cdc gov dpdx html ascariasis htm adult worms in the lumen of the small intestine produce 200000 eggs a day these eggs are then passed through the intestines and excreted in feces which remain in the soil these eggs are left to be ingested for several weeks when they become infective and can be swallowed when in the food and water supply once swallowed the larvae hatch and invade the intestines ascaris larvae are taken up in the portal veins to the lungs where they mature over 10 14 days then after maturation the pre adult ascaris move through the bronchi to the pharynx where they are swallowed and make their way into the intestinal lumen where they then mature and the cycle continues with adult worms producing new eggs adult worms can survive for over one year with proper nutrition taken from food digested by the human host there is no animal reservoir necessary as the eggs can survive in topsoil until humans ingest them further there exists no vector through which transmission can occur however because the adult worm lays approximately 200000 eggs per day the likelihood of re infection remains high from a purely numeric standpoint
