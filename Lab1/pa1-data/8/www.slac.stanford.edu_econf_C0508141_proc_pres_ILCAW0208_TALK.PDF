let requirements on rf stability page 1 let requirements on rf stability wg1 wg2 joint session on rf stability 16 august 2005 pt for wg1 1 page 2 what let issues drive rf stability mainly bunch compressor most designs use 1.3 ghz rf ttc at 30 to 35 mv m phase and amplitude errors can drive energy energy spread errors at ip not too serious arrival time bunch length errors at ip much more serious 16 august 2005 pt for wg1 2 page 3 bc rf bunch compressor may be single stage or two stage examples single stage 48 cavities two stage 32 cavities in stage 1 432 cavities in stage 2 4 possible configurations depending on final bunch length etc luminosity tolerances are estimated to be 5 variation in bunch length arrival time jitter 20 of  y 16 august 2005 pt for wg1 3 bunch length variation tolerance may be excessively tight but in any event it is arrival time jitter tolerance that drives all rf specifications page 4 tolerances on mean phase and amplitude of bc rf system 16 august 2005 pt for wg1 4 parameter 1 stage 300 a 300 b 150 a 150 b bc rf amplitude 0.2 0.1 0.15 0.08 0.1 bc rf phase 0.07 0.05 0.12 0.03 0.06 blue bc1 drives tolerance red bc2 drives tolerance purple both systems about equal page 5 klystron tolerances single stage bc has few klystrons maybe 4 klystron tolerance 2 system tolerance two stage bc has 20 klystrons in bc2 bc2 drives tolerances klystron tolerances can be 4.5 system tolerance in any event need to reserve some fraction of budget for systematic phase and amplitude errors some fraction for uncorrelated klystron jitter 16 august 2005 pt for wg1 5
