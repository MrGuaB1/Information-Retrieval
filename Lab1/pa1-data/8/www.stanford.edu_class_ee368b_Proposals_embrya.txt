the influence of dct blocksize and coding efficiency ayodele embry embrya stanford edu the fixed blocksize has been a popular techique for exploiting temporal redundancies in video and minimizing computation and complexity in still images however as we move towards standards which no longer have a static data size ie frame as in mpeg 4 it becomes important once again to look at the optimal blocksize for coding both still images and video a better approach would allow the motion field to adapt to the activity in the scene specifically smaller blocks should be used in areas that are hard to compensate while large blocks are appropriate when the motion or the scene is homogeneous further manipulating blocksize could provide better still image compression since areas of an image which have lots of detail could take advantage fo the smaller block size for better resolution in this project i propose to use matlab and experiment with the relative gains associated with varying the blocksize for dct ii i will run experiments on the dct with blocksizes of 2x2 4x4 8x8 16x16 32x32 and 64x64 i will apply both the dct and idct to several images and examine both the perceptual differences in the decoded image and the resulting gain in encoding efficiency i will also provide incite into why changing the blocksize affects the resulting gain
