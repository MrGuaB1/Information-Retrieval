untitled document life cycle life cycle trichostrongylus spp are infective as a third larval stage and are ingested along with plant material on infected pastures from this stage they develop through another stage to an adult stage the adult parasite sheds eggs into the intestine of the host which are passed into the environment through the feces the eggs are strongyle type and they hatch releasing a free living larval stage of the parasite the trichostrongyle larvae develop through a second larval stage to the third larval stage which is the infective stage interesting notes infective larvae develop in 4 6 days much longer periods are required in cool temperatures third stage larvae may survive 4 to 6 months on pasture especially in winter if the eggs dry out before they hatch they become dormant and can survive for as long as 15 months infection occurs by ingestion the developing larvae burrow into the mucosa the incubation period is 20 to 25 days when laid the eggs have already developed to the sixteen or thirty two cell stage they develop rapidly hatching in less than 20 hours in summer temperatures 70 80 degrees f in the infective stage larvae are also very resistant to dry conditions the goat or sheep is infected when they graze on grass where the larvae have migrated the larvae travel to the wall of the abomasum or the small intestine where they go through a molt they then leave the wall to live freely in the lumen of the intestine or stomach there they develop into adults and are laying eggs within 21 days after infection
