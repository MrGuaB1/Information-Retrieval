untitled document history accounts of pinworm infestation have existed in medical literature since the beginning of recorded time a worm causing intense pruritus ani perianal itch was described in early chinese indian arabic persian and greco roman populations and even hippocrates recorded his experience with the sleep disturbances caused by infestation with e vermicularis direct evidence of enterobiasis in ancient populations emerged with the discovery of e vermicularis eggs in dried fecal specimens known as coprolites found in archaeological sites the oldest known eggs were recovered from the danger cave and hogup cave in western utah from a 10000 year old coprolite described by fry and moore in a 1969 article published in science the coprolites were positively identified as belonging to the prehistoric humans who inhabited the caves the eggs reported in that article still represent the earliest recorded samples of e vermicularis although subsequent discoveries have been reported in many ancient populations around the world including a recent discovery among ancient egyptian mummies http home earthlink net shiseiryu1 shiseiryu1 nativeamerican bering htm the arrival of e vermicularis in the new world long before the arrival of european voyagers makes the worm's migration particularly interesting to scholars recovery of eggs from various prehistorical human coprolites has allowed researchers to trace the migratory patterns of the humans carrying the worm because the pinworm life cycle occurs entirely within humans and does not rely on specific soil or climatic conditions it is likely that e vermicularis was carried over by human migrations across the bering strait such an early spread of the worm in human populations helps explain its wide geographic distribution today
