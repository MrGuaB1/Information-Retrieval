gradient global view page 1 gradient global view minimize cost minimum capital cost about 40 mv m 1 tpc increase at 35 and 45 mv m 4 tpc increase at 30 mv m however ac to beam efficiency decreases from 17.0 at 28 mv m to 15.3 at 35 mv m provide extended physics reach choose gradient somewhat lower than thought achievable so higher energies are reachable at lower beam current luminosity use highest gradient cavities available at time of machine construction page 2 practical choice design for 30 mv m if decrease current by reducing number of bunches achieve the following energy reach 500 550 600 650 700 750 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 30 35 40 45 relative luminosity cms energy gev and gradient mv m page 3 note that luminosity reduction plot does not include the effect of emittance reduction from adiabatic damping this strategy decouples the risk associated with achieving higher gradients from the costing process while allowing future improvements to be incorporated however need to choose cavity shape and iris size discussed later 60 mm diameter would probably be ok from a wakefield perspective and would reduce cooling requirements by 14 and save 50 m in cryoplant costs page 4
