slac research associate positions to work on atlas slac research associate positions on atlas the slac national accelerator laboratory slac is seeking applicants for experimental postdoctoral research associate positions to work on the atlas experiment at cern the lhc presents ideal opportunities for physics at the energy frontier and experimental experience in a challenging environment of rapidly increasing luminosity these openings allow participation in a selection of experimental areas that slac is involved in and a variety of physics topics at the lhc the successful candidates are encouraged to take the initial post at cern some information on the slac atlas group can be found on our web page we currently have an opening to start around apr 2012 the position is open until filled and the evlauation of applicants is expected to start dec 12 2011 interested candidates should submit an application and arrange for their recommendation letters to be sent atlas involvement current experimental areas the slac team is involved in pixel detector high level trigger and daq simulation tier 2 computing facility at slac atlas upgrade the slac atlas group has over 30 people of which 8 are currently based at cern there are typically 6 7 research associates in the group at any given time and there are 1 2 replacement hiring each year as senior research associates move on to new positions we expect to strengthen our involvement in these areas although we may potentially expand to other areas the physics interest of the group has a main long range theme toward searches for new physics while the initial analysis effort also includes early standard model measurements our physics effort also has a strong emphasis on the buildup of physics signature tools through active engagement in several physics performance areas such as jet and missing et reconstruction tracking and b tagging as well as trigger algorithms and strategies for further information please contact prof su dong or dr charles young qualifications these are highly competitive positions as part of the general research associate program at slac requiring a background of demonstrated excellence in research and a recent phd in experimental particle physics the term of these positions is two years in the first instance and may be renewed how to apply interested candidates should submit the following a letter of application indicating the primary physics program of interest atlas cv selected bibliography that highlights personal contributions brief statement of research interest candidates should also ask at least three senior physicists who know their work to provide letters of recommendation please email your materials in electronic form pdf and at the same time ask your referees to email their letters to raadmin slac stanford edu the applications are continually accepted throughout the year and periodically processed in case your application must be processed on a short time scale due to other constraints please notify us at application time please note hires at the slac national accelerator laboratory are subject to department of energy approval and are required to complete environmental safety & health training atlas at slac slac atlas su dong and charlie young last modified mon nov 21 10 51 36 cet 2011
