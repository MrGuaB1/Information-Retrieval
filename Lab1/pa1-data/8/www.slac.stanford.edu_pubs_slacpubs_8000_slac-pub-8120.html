slac pub 8120 laser pulse heating slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8120 laser pulse heating abstract recently interest has developed in pulsed heating effects on a copper surface 1 pulsed heating is one of the limits on the gradient of a structure based linac the heat generated by an intense rf pulse on the metal surface can result in hundreds of degrees of temperature rise at 1 gev m after a certain number of cycles the metal may crack due to thermal fatigue and the surface properties may deteriorate in this article we describe an experiment to use a high power laser to study the pulsed temperature rise on a metal surface full text pdf slac pub 8120 185 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8120 87.6 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 05 pdt by htmlme pl
