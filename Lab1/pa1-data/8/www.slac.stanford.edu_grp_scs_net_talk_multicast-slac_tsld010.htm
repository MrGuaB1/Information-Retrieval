igmp and layer 2 switching igmp and layer 2 switching layer 2 switches operate at the mac layer ip multicast traffic maps to a l2 mac multicast address which is treated at l2 as a broadcast ieee behavior l2 switches therefore actually broadcast multicast traffic to all their ports this can be very detrimental to performance yes you can define static entries on the switches to control multicast at l2 but the administrative overhead can be enormous and static entries do not react to dynamic behaviors the solution is to enhance the intelligence of the layer 2 switches igmp snooping sneak peek into the layer 3 content of a multicast packet to make forwarding decisions may have performance penalties compared to cgmp cgmp cisco group multicast protocol previous slide next slide back to first slide view graphic version
