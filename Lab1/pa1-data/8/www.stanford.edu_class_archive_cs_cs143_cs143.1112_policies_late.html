late assignments late assignments basic policy assignments are penalized 5 per hour late an assignment is received when a course staff member actually has possession of it not when it is dropped off by you electronic submissions are always time stamped so submitting electronically is a reliable way to guarantee you get the earliest possible time of submission the fine print restrictions on late assignments for some projects the deadline may be firm sometimes we just have to have the assignments on a certain date eg to file final grades on time to keep the course moving along we generally make the next programming assignment available immediately after the previous one is due some assignments however may hint at the solution for the previous assignment and in this case we will ask people who are still working on the previous assignment not to look at the next assignment under no circumstances will any assignment be accepted more than 3 days past the original due date partners and late days if you are working with a partner and turn in your assignment late both of you are penalized instructor granted extensions extensions are granted only for extreme circumstances remember there are students who work long hours and ignore their other classes to meet deadlines miss events they had scheduled work when they are sick and turn in incomplete programs because they run out of time for someone to be given an extension their situation needs to be truly extraordinary
