elder zucker edge detector code c1 m returns c1 the minimum reliable scale for the gradient operator c2 m returns c2 the minumum reliable scape for the laplacian operator g1x m returns gaussian smoothing mask in x direction for specified scale g1y m returns gaussian smoothing mask in y direction for specified scale g2x m returns partial second derivative mask in x direction g2xy m returns cross partial second derivative mask g2y m returns partial second derivative mask in y direction gradient m returns the magnitude and angle of intensity gradient map in specified image with specified scale if optional marker matrix is given the matrix will be set to sd1 everywhere the gradient magnitude exceeds the critical value function of sd1 and left alone elsewhere and returned laplace m this function takes an image a scale the angle map and optional marker matrix it returns the laplacian map if given the optional marker matrix will be set to sd2 everywhere the gradient magnitude exceeds the critical value and left alone elsewhere steer1 m the steering function for the first derivative steer2 m the steering function for the second derivative runezd2 m this is the main function that calls the rest of them it takes two inputs an image matrix and an optional noise sigma it returns the edge map in unit8 units the laplacian of gaussian of the image the minimum reliable scale of each pixel and a blur estimate at the edge points many thanks to anat capsi for posting her code on the web this code represents a major revision of her elder zucker edge detector i reset the c1 and c2 functions to match the published numbers in elder and zucker's paper see references and i eliminated some non functioning portions of her code in addition i added the blur estimation portion of runezd2 m last modified tue nov 28 21 53 40 pst 2000
