slac polarized electron source group introduction the polarized electron source group is responsible for generating the polarized electrons used at the stanford linear accelerator center slac this is accomplished by illuminating a photocathode with circular polarized light the polarized electron source group personnel is responsible for maintaining the polarized light source pls and the photo injector which creates the polarized electrons for fixed target experiments at slac the photoinjector also delivers the unpolarized electron beam required by the pepii program besides insuring uninterrupted operation of the injector a considerable amount of r&d is carried out in the area of laser system and photocathode development artist's rendering of the polarized electron source in the gun test lab injector and support facilities the injector cid the polarized electron gun the loadlock the yag ti laser the flash ti laser photocathodes gun test lab cathode test lab ultra high purity water station high voltage test facility personnel source liaison schedule slac only references slcpolsource tech notes slac only r alley et al nucl instrum meth in phys res a 365 1995 1 27 recent poster presentations link to polarized photocathode research collaboration pprc meeting notes slac only link to tuesday sources meeting notes 11 26 02 recent link to tuesday sources meeting notes 10 29 96 5 21 2000 polarization seminar scheduled talks public transparencies slac only approved high energy physics experiments using polarized electrons end station a esa experiments slac home page this page maintained by axel brachmann and was last updated 11 13 02
