untitled document life cycle and transmission of capillaria philippinensis 1 unembryonated eggs deposited in the intestinal lumen of either the avian or human host are expelled in the feces whereupon the eggs are released into the external usually aqueous environment 2 the unembryonated eggs become embryonated while in the fresh or brackish water 3 the embryonated eggs are ingested by fresh or brackish water fish which serve as the intermediate host for the capillaria philippinensis inside the intestinal lumen of the fish the larvae hatch burrow through the intestinal mucosa and permeate the fish's mesenteric and peripheral tissues 4 the parasite enters the intestinal lumen of humans fish eating birds and other animal hosts upon ingestion of raw or undercooked c philippinensis infected fish 5 the adult worms of capillaria philippinensis burrow into the intestinal mucosa most typically of the jejunum 6 while in the intestinal lumen of the human or avian host the female worms deposit unembryonated eggs which are subsequently expelled in the host's feces albeit a rare occurence the eggs of capillaria philippinensis may become embryonated within the intestine of the human host the subsequent release of infective larvae leads autoinfection and hyperinfection photos on this page courtesy of www dpd cdc gov body_capillariasis_page1 htm
