a modular computer system for rapid on line analysis m schwartz stanford linear accelerator center we have developed a modular page 1 a modular computer system for rapid on line analysis m schwartz stanford linear accelerator center we have developed a modular bus oriented computing system with the aim of carrying out rapid on line analysis of wire spark cha lber data this system makes use of a set of bins each of which is equip d with a data transfer bus very similar in architecture to that of the dec pdp il the pdp li serves to genu out routing and operating instructions to the vario s computing modules in the system because of the pass ibili t j of buildi g g e2 t peed and flexibility into these modules and because of the i herent ai121ism of the system we have been able to achieve a speed of analysi3 which is s b s lant ially greater than that of the ibm 360 91 typically 1 2 ex peet la rnaly ea set of 20 spark chambers each with up to 16 tracks in under 5 milliseconds in this analysis we will determine all dir ction cosin s find momenta and transfer the results to a pdp 9 for loggir g on magnetic t e one of the important features of the syste is the ability to break the bus under program control so as to allo ottions of the system to operate independently of one another and in parallel in this way we can process the front and rear x and y spark chanbers inde endently the modules we have developed are flexible in having h iy 3tructions microprogrammable fer specific application work supported by the united states atomic energy commission 437
