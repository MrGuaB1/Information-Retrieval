isomap and lle for manifold learning page 1 ee378b statistical signal processing isomap and lle for manifold learning andrea montanari lecture 11 12 due on 12 3 2011 the objective of this homework is to develop familiarity with the isomap and lle algorithms discussed in class the file www stanford edu class ee378b face data tar bz2 or face data zip contains 698 images corresponding to different poses of the same face each image is given as a 64 64 luminosity map hence represented as a vector in r4096 this vector is stored as a row in the file this is one of the datasets used in jb tenenbaum v de silva and jc langford science 290 2000 2319 2323 1 choose a distance between images ie in this case a distance in r4096 construct a proximity graph with vertices corresponding to the images and connecting each image to the k nearest neighbors in the dataset for a suitable k notice that as a result each vertex is in general connected to more than k neighbors 2 implement the isomap algorithm and apply it to this graph to obtain ad 2 dimensional embedding present a plot of this embedding notice that once the graph is formed you should be able to use the program written for homework 5 3 implement the lle algorithm by roweis and saul to obtain a different d 2 dimensional embedding present a plot of this embedding comment on the differences if you notice any between the two results
