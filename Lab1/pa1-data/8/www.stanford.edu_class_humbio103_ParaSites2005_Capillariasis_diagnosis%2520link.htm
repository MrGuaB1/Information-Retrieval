untitled document diagnosis the specific diagnosis of capillaria philippinensis infection normally requires the demonstration of c philippinensis eggs in the stool of the patient or in tissue biopsies taken from the small intestine typically the eggs found in the feces are unembryonated however in rare and serious infections it is possible to also find embryonated eggs larvae and adult worms in the feces such findings are usually indiciative of autoinfection and are often accompanied by considerably greater numbers of the capillaria philippinensis parasite egg of c philippinensis under light microscopy eggs of c philippinensis in the tissue the specific diagnosis of c hepatica infection is based on demonstrating the adult worms and or eggs in liver tissue at biopsy or necropsy note identification of c hepatica eggs in the stool is a spurious finding which does not result from infection of the human host but from ingestion by that host of livers from infected animals photos on this page courtesy of http www cdfound to it html cap1 htm
