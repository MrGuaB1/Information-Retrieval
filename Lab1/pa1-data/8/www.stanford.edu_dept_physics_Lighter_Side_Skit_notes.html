stanford physics christmas skit production notes electronic playbill the 1994 christmas skit production notes this skit was written and performed for the entertainment of the stanford physics department on friday 1994 december 16 it might be hard to believe considering the polished nay professional job executed by the players but the entire scheme was hatched and written between thanksgiving and the 16th and i mean the 16th literally script changes persisted up until dinner was served we all hope our advisors now understand why none of us got any research done the week before christmas the original idea came from barry and doug conceived at the century cinema one million in mountain view while waiting for star trek generations i wrote the skeleton script but everyone involved contributed mightily to fleshing it out robin's character and her lines were created to marvelous effect by her own creative instincts i must extend my profound thanks to mohan who more than any of us had the role thrust upon him and of course the lion's share of thanks and applause must go to dr bob laughlin without whose enthusiastic participation this could never have come to be let the audience and the readers decide whether that is worth praise or blame bernie gilroy
