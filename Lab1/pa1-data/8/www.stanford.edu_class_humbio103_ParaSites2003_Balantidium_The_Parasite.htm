the parasite balantidium coli the parasite balantidium coli balantidium coli is the only ciliate known to parasitize humans ciliates represent a phylum of protozoa characterized in at least one stage of development by simple or compound ciliary organelles on the surface of their membranes that are used for locomotion ciliates have 2 nuclei one macronucleus and one micronucleus and reproduce by transverse binary fission conjugation autogamy and cytogamy balantidium coli has 2 contractile vacuoles although contractile vacuoles are common to ciliates they are rare in parasitic protozoa which suggests that balantidium coli has a unique osmoregulatory capacity balantidium coli has 2 developmental stages a trophozoite stage and a cyst stage see morphology and life cycle for descriptions of the stages taxonomy kingdom protista phylum ciliophora class litostomatea order vestibuliferida balantidium coli history balantidium coli has been known for more than a century and yet the pathogenicity of the protozoa and how humans acquire it are still not fully understood introduction the parasite morphology life cycle transmission animal reservoirs clinical presentation diagnosis treatment epidemiology public health interventions glossary of terms references and links
