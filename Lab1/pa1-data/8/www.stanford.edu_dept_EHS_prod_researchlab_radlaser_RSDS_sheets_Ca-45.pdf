safety sheet nuclide ca45 page 1 radionuclide safety data sheet nuclide ca45 forms all soluble physical characteristics half life 163 days type decay beta maximum energy 0.257 mev hazard category c level low hazard 0.01 to 1 millicurie b level moderate hazard 1 mci to 100 mci a level high hazard greater than 100 mci external radiation hazards and shielding millicurie quantities of ca45 do not present a significant external radiation hazard because the low energy betas emitted barely penetrate rubber gloves and the outer skin layer the dose rate to the basal cells of the skin from the deposition of one microcurie per cm2 is 3200 mrads per hours maximum ranges of these betas are 20 inches in air about 0.02 inches in plastic and only 0.009 inches in glass hazards if internally deposited the annual limit of intake which would deliver an effective dose equivalent of 500 mrems to the whole body is 160 uci based on icrp dosimetry and bioassay requirements film badges and or dosimeter rings are not required because of the low energy betas emitted when handling quantities of 5 millicuries or more finger rings could be used during initial use so as to establish any significant dose to the fingers urine assays may be required after spills or contamination incidents special problems and precautions 1 routinely survey work area using a survey instrument and smear techniques change gloves often 2 segregate wastes to those with half lives greater than 90 days but not with h3 and or c14 3 limit of soluble waste to sewer is 10 microcuries day per lab 6 90
