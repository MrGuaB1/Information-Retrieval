cs224m fall 2009 10 homework 1 game theory page 1 cs224m homework 1 1 cs224m fall 2009 10 homework 1 game theory handout 1 note homework 1 is due on october 05 2009 in class 1 25 points 2 player normal form game consider the following game player 2 l c r player 1 t 8 8 5 6 12 2 m 0 8 8 2 15 8 b 2 12 8 9 4 4 where the first number in each square is the payoff of player 1 and the second number is player 2's payoff a 5 points find all pareto optimal pure strategy profiles b 5 points find the pure strategy nash equilibria c 15 points find all mixed strategy nash equilibria hint look at the procedure on pages 62 63 of the book 2 25 points 3 player normal form game consider the 3 player normal form game in table 1 here each player has two strategies t b for player 1 l r for player 2 and n f for player 3 in this notation player 3 gets to select left or right table player 2 selects the column and player 1 selects the row for example if they play t l f they each get 2 2 6 respectively l r l r t 5 5 5 2 6 2 t 2 2 6 1 3 3 b 6 2 2 3 3 1 b 3 1 3 0 0 0 n f table 1 a three player normal form game a 5 points list all of the pure strategy nash equilibrium profiles of this game b 5 points list all pareto optimal outcomes of this game c 5 points compute the maxmin value or security level for player 1 d 10 points is there a correlated equilibrium in which all of the players achieve payoffs strictly better than in the nash equilibria you found in a if yes give an example otherwise explain why not 3 25 points extensive form games perfect information game consider a variation of the centipede game discussed on page 124 of the book the play still alternates between the two players they each start with a balance of $0 on each player's turn she has the option to continue the game or stop the game if she stops the other is allowed a final choice between accepting the accumulated payoff or discarding that payoff and page 2 cs224m homework 1 2 replacing it by a balance of 10 for each player if the player chooses to continue her balance is debited one dollar and the opponent is credited with three dollars if the second player has continued for a third time the game terminates note that in this case each player will each receive $6 a 10 points draw the extensive form for this game b 10 points how many nash equilibria are there for this game if it only lasts for 3 rounds c 5 points list the subgame perfect nash equilibria in the original game 4 25 points extensive form games imperfect information game each part of this problem will use the two player game of imperfect information given in figure 1 however the meaning of the numbers at the leaves will differ in part a we consider a common value game thus the value at a leaf defines the payoff of both players in parts b and c we switch to a zero sum game in that case the value of a leaf defines the payoff of player 1 and the negative of the payoff of player 2 in each part briefly justify your answer 1 2 r r r r r r r r r r l c r u d u d l c r 3 100 100 0 5 1 10 figure 1 an imperfect information game in which each player has a single information set a 5 points for the common value game defined by figure 1 list all pure strategy nash equilibria none exists is a possible answer b 5 points for the zero sum game defined by figure 1 list all pure strategy nash equilibria none exists is a possible answer c 15 points now we will allow mixed but not behavioral strategies for the zero sum game defined by figure 1 list all possibly mixed nash equilibria as there could be an infinite number of mixed nash equilibria you should use variables and give ranges over which strategy profiles constitute nash equilibria hints 1 the characterization is simple 2 use the fact that the game is a zero sum game
