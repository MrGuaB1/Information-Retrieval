searches for diffuse astrophysical neutrino fluxes with icecube and amanda gary c hill for the icecube collaboration the icecu page 1 searches for diffuse astrophysical neutrino fluxes with icecube and amanda gary c hill for the icecube collaboration the icecube detector located at the amundsen scott south pole station is the largest neutrino detector ever constructed it currently consists of 40 of the planned 80 strings each instrumented with 60 optical modules between 1500 and 2500 metres depth in the clear antarctic ice one of the key searches is for a diffuse flux of high energy extra terrestrial neutrinos in excess of that observed from cosmic ray induced atmospheric neutrinos to date the best constraints on a diffuse flux come from icecube's predecessor amanda antarctic muon and neutrino detector array the current focus is on analysis of the 2007 icecube 22 string data which will exceed the sensitivity of the integrated amanda exposure we will review the amanda results and discuss the progress and status of the 22 string analysis 1
