search for supernova relic neutrino at super kamiokande page 1 search for supernova relic neutrino at super kamiokande supernova relic neutrino srn is diffuse supernova neutrino background from all past supernova interaction in sk motivation srn measurement will enable us to investigate the history of past supernova for example the flux of srn would show the star formation rate and supernova rate in galaxies  e p e+ n the main interaction for srn search in the sk detector is inverse decay solar 8b solar hep atmospheric  predicted srn flux reactor  neutrino energy mev  flu x cm 2 se c mev energy region for srn search srn is dominant neutrino in 18 40 mev sn1987a the main interaction for srn search in the sk detector is charged current quasi elastic interaction of e inverse  decay takashi iida icrr 1496days sk i and 791days sk ii are used for this analysis page 2 total positron energy mev sk i preliminary sk ii preliminary total positron energy mev 90 cl flux limit sk i 1.25 cm2 sec sk ii 3.68 cm2 sec sk i sk ii 1.08 cm2 sec data decay e atmospheric e summary observed spectrum was fit well with estimated bgs and excess of srn signal was not observed from fitting result 90 flux upper limit was calculated by combined analysis of sk i and sk ii flux limit of 1.08 cm2 sec is obtained
