title elder zucker image compressions implementation & analysis chad netzer cnetzer stanford edu dion monstavicius dionm stanford edu we propose implementing the still image compression scheme proposed by elder et al in ref 1 this scheme is as follows encoder 1 perform a multi resolution edge detection scheme to find relevent edges in an image 2 at these edge boundaries keep the intensity information and an estimate of the first derivative for transmission depending on the image this can reduce complexity by order n 3 perform compression on this data for transmission chad and i may investigate possible implementations for this part elder does not detail this part decoder 1 with the boundary information reconstruct the image by solving laplace's equation using the edge information as a boundary condition we expect this to be the most challenging part of the project 2 elder illustrates how this step still retains artifacts and proposes an additional processing step to supress these artifacts project goals project goals 1 sucessful implementation of scheme 2 rate distortion analysis of compression of technique 3 proposals for practical encoding of edge information references 1 jh elder et al are edges incomplete international journal of computer vision 1999 vol 34 no 2 3 p 97 2 jh elder et al local scale control for edge detection an dblur estimation ieee transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence july 1998 vol 20 no 7 p 699
