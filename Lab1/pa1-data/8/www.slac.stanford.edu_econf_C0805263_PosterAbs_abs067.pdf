borexino is a real time detector for low energy solar neutrino spectroscopy installed in the underground laboratories 3800 mwe page 1 borexino is a real time detector for low energy solar neutrino spectroscopy installed in the underground laboratories 3800 mwe depth at gran sasso italy lngs borexino is specifically designed to measure the mono energetic 866 kev 7be flux via neutrino electron elastic scattering in ultra pure organic scintillation liquid the separation of signal and background relies on the identification of the compton like edge in the recoil electron energy spectrum at 667 kev the physics potential of borexino strongly depends on the unprecedented requirements of low level background the exceptional radio purity reached by the borexino in order to guarantee the success of the experiment must be complemented with the identification and discrimination of the residual intrinsic contaminants as well as of the external and cosmogenic backgrounds crucial in this respect are the energy and spatial reconstruction capabilities of the detector which thus require a careful and precise assessment we report on the borexino performances after 1 year of data taking in reconstructing event energy and position in discriminating on the nature of the contaminant with the pulse shape analysis and in the identification of fast coincidences looking at time and space correlations
