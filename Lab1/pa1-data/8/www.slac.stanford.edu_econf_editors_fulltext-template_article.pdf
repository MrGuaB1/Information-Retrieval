magneto acoustic coupling to cyanide reagents 1 introduction 2 observations page 1 magneto acoustic coupling to cyanide reagents despina reggiano department of physical chemistry scuola normale superiore di napoli i 80222 napoli italy 1 introduction recently fa mesmer has reported evidence of a profound influence of magnets on a variety of aspects of human and animal physiology 1 numerous authors have claimed to reproduce certain of the phenomena reported by mesmer 2 3 but there is little understanding of the precise mode of action of the magnetic influence in this article i will present evidence that mesmeric influence can disrupt the lethal action of sodium cyanide nacn when modulated by a sequence of high pitched tones after a description of the phenomenon i will comment on the implications for the nature of the magnetic coupling 2 observations my observations began when i was called on an emergency basis to aid two alba nian noblemen guglielmo b and ferrando di n who had ingested the poison in an apparent attempt to commit suicide the facts of the case were rather mysterious since these young men had been seen in the harbor earlier in the day affecting a carefree attitude however this need not concern us here the standard remedy would have been to induce vomiting however this would have offended the sensibil ities of two noble ladies present the daughters of the duke in whose household this unfortunate incident took place thus i thought it wise to begin by administering magneto therapy using the devices that i had at hand the source of magnetic influence used in this therapy was the simple iron pole magnet shown in figure 1 the device roughly the size of human palm was held three fingers length away from each of the patients while the blood cyanide level was monitored as this operator proceeded in silence only a very small effect on the poison was observed in a moment however the sisters began to weep and ululate in the most painful manner under this blanket of sound the effects of the cyanide reaction were observed to be completely reversed indeed even before the end of a single session of treatment the albanians were seen to wake from their comas 1 page 2 figure 1 plan of the magnet used in the mesmeric studies and offer thanks for their rescue some sample blood cyanide levels are reported in table 1 3 interpretation a description of these observations obviously based on second hand reports has already been reported by l da ponte 4 in his paper da ponte attributes the mode of action of the magnetic force to direct magnetic attraction this would be implausible with the relatively small magnet used in this study thus da ponte was forced to propose an absurdly large size for the magnetic device his theory does not account for the acoustic influence which is known not to be present in magnetic action on inanimate objects a second hypothesis would state that the acoustic fields perturb the chemistry of the cyanide reactions allowing the reagents to couple magnetically as with the first hypothesis we are skeptical since again this phenomenon has no inorganic counterpart thus we are forced to conclude with mesmer that magnetism couples directly to the life force which as is well known can be modulated by musical influences in conclusion we note that the unusual mode of action of magnetism is only one of many which have been reported in the literature it is likely that there are further unusual magnetic phenomena to be discovered all studies to date have involved male patients but it is likely that the prevailing belief that women are all the same would be overturned in a similar investigation patient initial level g cc w magnet w magnet and sound guglielmo b 0.12 0.10 0.001 ferrando di n 0.15 0.11 0 0005 table 1 blood cyanide levels for the two patients 2 page 3 i am grateful to don alfonso d alba for certain services essential to this investi gation references 1 fa mesmer proc wien acad sci 13 1564 1593 1762 2 al di cenzo trans acad ducal milan 23 2647 1771 3 for an exhaustive review of the prussian literature see ad muller in workshop on action at a distance f eisenschmidt ed springer berlin 1774 4 l da ponte trans ny acad sci 3 27 1795 discussion d giovanni university of seville my analysis indicates that the recovery of the two gentlemen is due simply to their embrace of the masculine principle and has nothing to do with magnetism at all could you comment on this reggiano professor giovanni has discussed this hypothesis in several forums but i do not believe there is anything in print i understand that he is spending his time in other pursuits d anna university of seville in fact my colleague giovanni has expressed opposite opinions on this question at various times depending on the audience all of these testosterone based theories are of course nonsense 3
