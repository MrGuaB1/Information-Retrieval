cosmological relic neutrino detection using beta decaying nuclei page 1 cosmological relic neutrino detection using beta decaying nuclei we present a study on the interaction of low energy electron neutrinos on nuclei that undergo both beta decay and electron capture we show that due to the absence of an energy threshold and to the relatively high value of the cross sec tion these processes are the only ones to date having a realistic chance to unam biguously detect the yet undiscovered cosmological relic neutrino background experimental challenges along the path for suitable detection techniques will be discussed
