title dark matter and leptogenesis in a non susy model for neutrino masses page 1 title dark matter and leptogenesis in a non susy model for neutrino masses author daijiro suematsu kanazawa university abstract we propose a unified explanation for the origin of dark matter and baryon number asymmetry on the basis of a non supersymmetric model for neutrino masses neutrino masses are generated by two distinct ways that is tree level seesaw mechanism with a single right handed neutrino and one loop radiative effects by a new additional doublet scalar a spontaneously broken u 1 brings a z_2 symmetry which restricts couplings of this new doublet scalar and controls the neutrino masses it also guarantees the stability of a cdm candidate we examine two possible candidates for the cdm we also show that the decay of a heavy right handed neutrino related to the seesaw mechanism can generate baryon number asymmetry through leptogenesis
