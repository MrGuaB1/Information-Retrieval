an open letter to the hep theory community about academic jobs online spires image hep hepnames institutions conferences experiments jobs videos dear high energy physics colleagues we are writing to encourage all high energy physics groups to use the web site academicjobsonline org ajo to process postdoctoral applications beginning with searches this fall ajo is an offshoot of a system mathjobs org which was set up by the duke university math department under the sponsorship of the american mathematical society and has been widely used by the us mathematics community since 2000 ajo is now available to list academic jobs at institutions throughout north america job applicants can be from any country the plan is that applicants and their recommenders will each make one submission to this site and have that submission be read by as many north american institutions as desired to facilitate the use of the site by the high energy physics community academicjobsonline has created within the discipline of physics subject areas corresponding to the arxiv categories used by members of the dpf a single job would typically be listed under several subject areas according to the interests of the group that is advertising the position fees to use the site are $50 yr for a small research group to list up to two jobs and $400 yr for departments with up to seven job listings as noted above each job can be listed under all appropriate subject areas our groups support the use of this site and are in the process of listing our open fall 2009 postdoctoral searches on ajo we strongly encourage all groups to consider using the site since its usefulness and convenience increase as more jobs are listed we also request that this message be forwarded to potential applicants for hep postdoctoral positions so they will be aware of ajo before beginning their job application process this fall with best regards r sekhar chivukula and elizabeth h simmons michigan state university jonathan bagger johns hopkins university david morrison uc santa barbara michael e peskin slac hep theory group christopher t hill fermilab theory group anthony aguirre tom banks michael dine howard haber and stefano profumo santa cruz institute for particle physics university of california santa cruz carlos em wagner and ian low argonne national laboratory pat kalyniak heather logan stephen godfrey carleton university jeff harvey richard hill david kutasov emil martinec jon rosner savdeep sethi carlos wagner particle theory group enrico fermi institute university of chicago danny marfatia doug mckay and john ralston kansas university ikaros bigi antonio delgado and chris kolda university of notre dame zvi bern eric d hoker graciela gelmini per kraus michael gutperle and alex kusenko university of california los angeles andre de gouvea and ian low northwestern university markus luty uc davis gordy kane katherine freese finn larsen aaron pierce high energy theory group university of michigan ulrich baur suny buffalo lynne orr university of rochester keith dienes ina sarcevic shufang su and doug toussaint university of arizona matthew headrick albion lawrence and howard schnitzer theory group martin fisher school of physics brandeis university edward farhi director center for theoretical physics massachusetts institute of technology j distler w fischler v kaplunovsky s paban and s weinberg theory group physics department university of texas at austin tom banks emmanuel diaconescu daniel friedan greg moore sergei lukyanov matthew strassler scott thomas sasha zamolodchikov new high energy theory center rutgers university baha balantekin vernon barger daniel chung lisa everett tao han akikazu hashimoto frank petriello michael ramsey musolf gary shiu university of wisconsin madison matthew schwartz and frederik denef high energy theory group harvard university martin schmaltz boston university last updated 02 16 2012 valid xhtml 1.0 valid css
