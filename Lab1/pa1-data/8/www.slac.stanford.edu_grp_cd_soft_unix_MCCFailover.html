mcc failover slac cpe software engineering group stanford linear accelerator center system admin how to failover from mcc to mccdev slac detailed slac computing software home software detailed last modified february 19 2010 booting up mccdev's hardware as mcc all cluster members must be down type show cluster mcc gets shutdown last so shutdown all nodes before mcc switch the slcnet pcil fibers between mcc and mccdev hardware the fibre cable pair that connects the pcil to the slcnet gateway is bright yellow with a blue connector the pcil is in the second from the top most pci slot and the fibre connects to it from the back of the alpha s simply pull gently the fibre out of its connector on mcc gently reroute it to the back of mccdev unplug mccdev's pcil fibre and plug mcc's pcil fibre into mccdev's pcil b oot the mccdev hardware from the mcc root directory on the system disk and start the production control system at the prompt boot flags 4 0 subsequently you could reboot any other cluster members except failed mcc hardware normally for testing the mcc hardware you could reboot it from the mccdev root directory on the system disk boot flags 5 0 after hardware failures have been fixed you could choose to leave the roles of mcc and mccdev permanently swapped rather than going thru a similar failback procedure mcc mccdev boot_dev dua0 12.0 5.0 boot_osflags 4 0 boot_dev dua0 12.0 5.0 boot_osflags 5 0 slac cpe software engineering group slac home page
