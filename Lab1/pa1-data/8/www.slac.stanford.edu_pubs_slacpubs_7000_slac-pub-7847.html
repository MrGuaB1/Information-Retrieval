slac pub 7847 recent luminosity improvements at the slc slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 7847 recent luminosity improvements at the slc abstract the luminosity of the slac linear collider slc has been increased by more than a factor of three during the 1997 98 run improved alignment and emittance tuning techniques throughout the accelerator resulted in minimal emittance growth from the damping rings to the final focus in particular a revised strategy for wakefield cancellation using precision beam size measurements at the entrance of the final focus proved effective for optimizing emittance the final focus lattice was modified to provide stronger demagnification near the interaction point and to remove residual higher order aberrations beam sizes as small as 1.5 by 0.65 microns were achieved at full beam intensity of 4 10 10 particles per pulse with these parameters the mutual focusing of the beams in collision becomes significant resulting in a further increase in the luminosity recorded sld event rates confirmed the theoretical calculations of the disruption enhancement which was typically 50 to 100 full text pdf slac pub 7847 126 kb compressed postscript not available for this document more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 08 pdt by htmlme pl
