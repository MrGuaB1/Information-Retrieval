abstract bio computer systems laboratory colloquium 4 15pm wednesday feb 21 2001 nec auditorium gates computer science building b03 the piranha project designing a scalable cmp based system for commercial workloads luiz andre barroso compaq western research lab about the talk current microprocessor industry trends towards optimizing single thread performance will if continued lead to exceedingly complex cores that are unlikely to perform well for commercial workloads these applications are known to yield poor instruction level parallelism although they are rich in thread level parallelism in this talk i will review our group's research on understanding the behavior of commercial workloads and describe the architecture that it inspired piranha piranha is a research prototype that uses chip multiprocessing as the basis for a scalable shared memory system that is optimized for database and web internet server workloads the project is a partnership between compaq research and the compaq nonstop hardware division compaq announced june 26 th that the alpha will be phased out in favor of the intel itanium processor click here for the new york times article dra about the speaker luiz andre barroso has been a member of the research staff at the compaq western research lab since 1995 when it was still digital his current interests are in computer architecture and design of server class systems cache coherence protocols and commercial workload performance he holds a phd in computer engineering from usc and ms bs degrees in electrical engineering from puc university rio de janeiro contact information luiz andre barroso compaq western research laboratory 250 university ave palo alto ca 94301 650 617 3317 650 617 3374 luiz barroso compaq com
