raymond ku page 1 does law inspire creativity an empirical analysis of copyright's bounty raymond shih ray ku jiayang sun richard fan abstract in this study we use statistical analysis to evaluate whether changes in copyright law influence the number of new works created relying upon us copyright registrations from 1870 through 2006 as a proxy for the number of works created we considered how four variables population the economy law changes both legislative and judicial and technology influenced new copyright registrations our findings demonstrate that the historic growth in new copyrighted works is largely a function of non copyright related changes including population and economic growth despite the logic of the theory that increasing copyright protection will increase the number of copyrighted works the data show no such correlation as such our study provides new insight into the relationship between changes in copyright law and human creativity in general and confirms the work of landes and posner with regard to changes to the length of copyright protection in particular the only consistently statistically significant law changes are those that directly affect the registration process increases in the registration fee congress's decision to eliminate any requirement for registration of foreign works and the availability of group registration for serials these observations are not only true for overall registrations but for individual categories of copyrighted works including books visual arts performing arts sound recordings and motion pictures beyond registration related law changes there is some evidence to suggest that more recent increases in copyright protection may actually decrease the number of new works created overall these findings cast serious doubt on the proposition that increasing copyright protection increases the number of copyrighted works available to the public
