slac pub 9537 effective lagrangians in pseudo supersymmetry slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 9537 effective lagrangians in pseudo supersymmetry abstract i discuss effective field theories of brane world models where different sectors break different halves of the extended bulk supersymmetry it is shown how to consistently couple mathcal n 2 supersymmetric matter to mathcal n 1 superfields that lack mathcal n 2 partners but transform in a non linear representation of the mathcal n 2 algebra in particular i explain how to couple an mathcal n 2 vector to mathcal n 1 chiral fields such that the second supersymmetry is non linearly realized this method is then used to study systems where different sectors break different halves of supersymmetry which appear naturally in models of intersecting branes equations render on windows mac os aix linux solaris and irix with the techexplorer plug in full text pdf slac pub 9537 95.5 kb compressed postscript slac pub 9537 129 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 13 dec 2002 15 28 pst by htmlme pl
