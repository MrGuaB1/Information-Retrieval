slac pub 8344 experimental signatures of split fermions in extra dimensions slac slac pubs and reports slac pub 8344 experimental signatures of split fermions in extra dimensions abstract the smallness and hierarchy of the fermion parameters could be explained in theories with extra dimensions where doublets and singlets are localized at slightly separated points scattering cross sections for collisions of such fermions vanish exponentially at energies high enough to probe the separation distance this is because the separation puts a lower bound on the attainable impact parameter in the collision the nlc and in particular the combination of the e e and e e modes can probe this scenario even if the inverse fermion separation is of order tens of tevs full text pdf slac pub 8344 168 kb compressed postscript slac pub 8344 189 kb alternate download methods old ancient download methods technical info techexplorer slac pub 8344 3.31 kb notes the pdf version of this document was distilled from a postscript file most likely created from latex source which used type 3 fonts the resultant pdf may be unreadable on the screen at the default viewing magnification fonts will appear bitmapped jagged though the type will be legible at higher magnifications despite the cosmetic problems resulting from the use type 3 fonts in the original source file such pdf files print without problems likewise the onscreen text is searchable and selectable more information full bibliographic data for this document including its complete author list is or soon will be available from slac's spires hep database please report problems with this file to posting slac stanford edu the slac preprint inventory is provided by the slac technical publications department page generated 04 apr 2001 15 07 pdt by htmlme pl
