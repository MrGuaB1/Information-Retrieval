unix disk space costs stanford linear accelerator center unix disk space costs unix at slac backup updated 13 aug 2001 it is reasonable to ask for up to a total of 1 2 gb with little or no justification although for performance reasons we strongly prefer to limit inidividual afs volumes to about 500 mb see the afs quota request form for more information on afs volumes beyond that we generally would like to see some sort of explanation of what you need the space for when there are larger quantities of data involved it can become important to locate the data on the best fileserver for the task understand the network requirements and determine the backup strategy while it is true that the raw cost per gb for typical pc hard disks has become quite low the disks we use on our fileservers are more expensive since they must meet higher standards for reliability in addition there are a number of hidden costs associated with shared storage such as management backup networking the cost of the servers etc we put all critical data including users home directories into raid disks systems which provide even greater reliability but at significant additional costs in disk overhead smart controllers redundant powers supplies and so forth altogether these can raise the cost per gb considerably over that for a low end disk at fry's when one multiplies by the number of unix accounts on our system i m sure you can understand why we don t automatically give every new account several gbs of storage
