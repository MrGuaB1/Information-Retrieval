libc info setvbuf libc info setvbuf go forward to siprintf go backward to setbuf go up to stdio go to the top op libc setvbuf specify file or stream buffering synopsis include stdio h int setvbuf file fp char buf int mode size_t size description use setvbuf to specify what kind of buffering you want for the file or stream identified by fp by using one of the following values from stdio h as the mode argument _ionbf do not use a buffer send output directly to the host system for the file or stream identified by fp _iofbf use full output buffering output will be passed on to the host system only when the buffer is full or when an input operation intervenes _iolbf use line buffering pass on output to the host system at every newline as well as when the buffer is full or when an input operation intervenes use the size argument to specify how large a buffer you wish you can supply the buffer itself if you wish by passing a pointer to a suitable area of memory as buf otherwise you may pass null as the buf argument and setvbuf will allocate the buffer warnings you may only use setvbuf before performing any file operation other than opening the file if you supply a non null buf you must ensure that the associated storage continues to be available until you close the stream identified by fp returns a 0 result indicates success eof failure invalid mode or size can cause failure portability both ansi c and the system v interface definition issue 2 require setvbuf however they differ on the meaning of a null buffer pointer the svid issue 2 specification says that a null buffer pointer requests unbuffered output for maximum portability avoid null buffer pointers both specifications describe the result on failure only as a nonzero value supporting os subroutines required close fstat isatty lseek read sbrk write created mon nov 8 17 42 54 2004 on tillpc with info_to_html version 0.9 6
