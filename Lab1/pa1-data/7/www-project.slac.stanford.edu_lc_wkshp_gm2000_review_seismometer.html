seismometer introduction to the problems what is modern seismometer the principle of a modern seismometer is still the same a mass on a spring what makes a seismometer modern is the careful mechanical design accurate method of detection of the test mass motion coil in magnetic field sometime capacitive method and in some wideband sensors feedback applied to the test mass which allowing to avoid the resonance of the mass and to extend sensitivity to lower frequency range hopefully the reader would not be satisfied with such a short description see the following pages for a very thorough review of seismometers and seismic observations in general seismic sensors and their calibration by erhard wielandt institute of geophysics university of stuttgart you may also check the following links lennartz seismometers
