cs348b spring 2008 rendering competition cs348b spring 2008 rendering competition the renderings below were created for the rendering competition in cs348b image synthesis techniques taught by pat hanrahan in the spring quarter of 2008 brad tennis was the ta for the class the competition was held on monday june 9th 2008 the distinguished judges for the competition were ingo wald intel advanced graphics architectures group kayvon fatahalian stanford university grand prize rendering a nebula by sergey levine and edward luong sergey and edward rendered this fantastic picture of the eagle nebula they used volumetric photon mapping with multiple scattering in a non homogeneous medium to simulate the emissive properties of the nebula more info final image first prize rendering chatoyant tiger's eye by matthew fisher matthew experimented with different techniques for rendering tiger's eye gems his investigation focused primarily on simulating the chatoyancy effect which causes a characteristic band of reflected light due to aligned grooves in the gem more info final image second prize soap bubbles and thin film interference by david harju and simon que david and simon devised a procedural algorithm for creating physically accurate soap bubble clusters they also implemented thin film interference to simulate the color variation across the bubbles surface more info final image honorable mention micro structure generation and rendering by derek chan and young min kim derek and young min extended pbrt's shape system to include a micro structure layer of fractally grown spherical pores although they were originally interested in modeling porous foods such as cake they found their system was also capable of generating convincing stone and concrete more info final image more great projects single and multiple subsurface scattering by zinnia zheng and peter huang zinnia and peter implemented single and multiple subsurface scattering to produce this image of shishi a mythical lion often placed in front of palaces temples government offices and home entrances in china more info final image rendering the iridescence of pearls by nikhil arora nikhil investigated multi layer and single thin film interference to model the iridescence of pearls in the image at left the pearl on the left has no interference component and the pearl on the right is rendered using single thin film interference more info final image rendering a full color glass horse by yi ting yeh yi ting implemented a new material class and modified the photon mapping integrator to produce this image of a horse made of photosensitive glass the absorption properties of the material are procedurally generated by modified perlin noise functions more info final image rendering of icicles by omar elafifi omar modeled some of the interesting properties of ice including birefringence multiple indices of refraction for one material and the quasi liquid layer a thin layer of semi structured water molecules to create this image of icicles more info final image multiple volume scattering with volumetric photon mapping by robert travis robert extended the photon mapping integrator to allow volumetric caustic effects such as the bright ray seen in the shadow of the sphere in this image more info final image rendering algebraic surfaces by gennadiy chuyeshov gennadiy implemented a root finding method to allow algebraic surfaces surfaces that can be described by an equation of the form p x y z 0 where p x y z is a polynomial function to be rendered by pbrt the surface shown in the image at left is called the kiss surface more info final image subsurface scattering by isabelle kim isabelle implemented subsurface scattering to create the image at left notice the bright ring around the edges of the cube where the optical distance is shortest more info final image
