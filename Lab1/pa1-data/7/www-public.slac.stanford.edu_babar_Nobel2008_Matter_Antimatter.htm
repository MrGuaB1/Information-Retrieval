first signs of matter antimatter asymmetry home performance data results about babar employment organization links first signs of matter antimatter asymmetry see also the babar nobel 2008 web page up to the 1950s physicists assumed that the forces in nature obeyed certain symmetries these included time reversal symmetry and mirror image symmetry also known as parity or p the best known forces electromagnetism and gravity did exhibit symmetric behavior for example think of watching a movie of billiard balls colliding simply by watching two balls collide you can t tell whether the movie is running forward or backward similarly if you watch the balls collide while looking into a mirror you will not see anything unusual about it if you didn t already know you were looking in a mirror nothing about the collisions would let you discover that fact so it was a great surprise when in 1957 it was discovered that the weak nuclear force did not obey the mirror image symmetry after all soon it was noted that if one combined the mirror image operation p with changing particles to anti particles and vice versa an operation called charge conjugation or c that an overall symmetry was regained under the combination cp and it was an even greater surprise when in 1964 james cronin and val fitch discovered that even this new cp symmetry was also sometimes violated in the decays of neutral kaon particles they shared the 1980 nobel prize in physics for this discovery which is the first known instance of cp violation your browser does not have the ability to display inline frames you can view the content of this frame at this page slac footer content cowan page mcdunn valid html 4.01 valid css
