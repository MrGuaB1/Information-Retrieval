guinea pig a beam beam interaction simulation program guinea pig guinea pig is an e e beam beam simulation program written by daniel schulte this page has been prepared for snowmass 2001 and some external links have been removed the official nlc beam delivery guinea pig page can be found here documentation see the new guinea pig manual 2 2 99 which kathy thompson has adapted from appendix a of daniel's thesis this manual describes the input parameters and the output files the classic reference for the physics of the beam beam interaction is beam beam phenomena in linear colliders k yokoya and p chen frontiers of particle beams intensity limitations edited by m month and s turner lecture notes in physics vol 400 springer verlag berlin 1990 pp 415 445 to install guinea pig source code only tested on linux copy the source code to your own machine and run the makefile to create an executable program version the code corresponds to ver_1999_07_08 acc dat input file the acc dat file defines the machine and the processes you want to simulate to run the program edit the acc dat file see the documentation to understand what individual variables do run the program via guinea accelerator parameters fileout out for example guinea nlc b 500 standard nlcb0500 out standard output the canonical snowmass nlc configurations have been run to produce output files which can be used to study machine backgrounds a few example bunch crossings have been processed through geant3 models of the ld and sd detectors hbook ntuples of the resulting hits in the detectors can be found in the appropriate directories here the files can be analyzed with paw using the kuip macro files found here or converted to root tuples using h2root or within jas using this example analysis
