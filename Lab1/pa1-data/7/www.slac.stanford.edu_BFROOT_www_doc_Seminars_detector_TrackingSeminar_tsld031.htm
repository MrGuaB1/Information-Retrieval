kalman filter cont kalman filter cont kalman fitting is really about taking weighted averages it's the simplest way to get the track errors right with global fits the errors cannot always be trusted eg multiple scattering is most often ignored for speed and recall that in babar the particles come from b's decaying almost at rest in the cm frame so they have low momenta and multiple scattering becomes a very serious effect previous slide next slide back to first slide view graphic version
