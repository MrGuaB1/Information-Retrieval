status of the slc linac abstract page 1 slac pub 7889 july 1998 status of the slc linac f j decker mg minty y nosochkov p raimondi stanford linear accelerator center stanford university stanford ca 94309 usa abstract an important contribution to the increased luminosity of the slac linear collider slc in 1997 98 is due to improved performance of the linac new tuning and stabilization strategies have reduced the emittance growth to nearly negligible values 10 in x and 30 in y a stronger lattice has less sensitivity to wakefields a new orbit correction scheme and a different emittance tuning procedure reduce the emittance growth further the stability is improved by counteracting diurnal changes and additionally checking klystron phases the jitter of the beam is monitored by analyzing the fft spectrum for sources and keeping it under control careful attention is paid to the longitudinal setup from the rings to provide an optimal bunch length at the interaction point for maximum disruption enhancement presented at the sixth european particle accelerator conference stockholm sweden 22 26 june 1998 work supported by the department of energy contract de ac03 76sf00515
