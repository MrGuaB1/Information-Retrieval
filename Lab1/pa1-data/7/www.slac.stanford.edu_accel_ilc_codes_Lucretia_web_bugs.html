lucretia known bugs lucretialogo the lucretia project known bugs the lucretia management endeavors to correct bugs as quickly as they are discovered especially any bugs in the mexfiles which can cause all kinds of misery in some cases we discover bugs which cause mexfile problems but require sufficiently weird conditions to trigger them that we put them on the back burner until we have a spare moment those bugs are listed here at this time there are no known uncorrected bugs in lucretia corrected known bugs the following bugs were corrected in the release on 02 august 2007 ill defined short range wakefields in the case where wakefields are defined with z values 0 the opposite of what lucretia is expecting a crash can occur we think that the problem is that the spliner tries to use the shape of the wakefield defined only for z 0 to apply wakes from leading slices of the bunch to trailing slices for which z 0 and this can lead to a huge numerical value for the wakefield especially in the case of the longitudinal wake humongous energy spread in the case of a bunch with an rms energy spread which is comparable to 1 a crash occurs we think that the problem is that rays with a negative initial energy are generated in the makebeam routines and that the logic which traps ill constructed beams at entry to trackthru is not catching them properly crash on apertures a bug is present which causes lucretia to crash when it tries to determine whether a ray is outside the aperture of an element setting the aper flag in the trackflag data structure to zero allows tracking to continue without crashing but also without checking positions of rays wrt the apertures synchrotron radiation a minor error in the handling of synchrotron radiation in bend magnets causes the emittance growth from sr to be slightly overestimated quarkpt 02 august 2007 slac logo
