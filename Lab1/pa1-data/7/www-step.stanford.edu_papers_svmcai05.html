sankaranarayanan sipma manna scalable analysis of linear systems using mathematical programming scalable analysis of linear systems using mathematical programming sriram sankaranarayanan henny b sipma zohar manna we present a method for generating linear invariants for large systems the method performs forward propagation in an abstract domain consisting of arbitrary polyhedra of a predefined fixed shape the basic operations on the domain like abstraction intersection join and inclusion tests are all posed as linear optimization queries which can be solved efficiently by existing lp solvers the number and dimensionality of the lp queries are polynomial in the program dimensionality size and the number of target invariants the method generalizes similar analyses in the interval octagon and octahedra domains without resorting to polyhedral manipulations we demonstrate the performance of our method on some benchmark programs in proc of verification model checking and abstract interpretation vmcai 05 lncs 3385 pp 21 47 springer verlag 2005 bibtex postscript pdf 2005 springer verlag henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu last modified april 7 14 40 50 pdt 2005
