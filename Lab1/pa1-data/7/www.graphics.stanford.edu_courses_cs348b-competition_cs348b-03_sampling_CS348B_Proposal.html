proposal for the final project of cs348b proposal for the final project of cs348b soap bubble xiaohu zhang tom i have been thinking about rendering the effect of thin film interfernce since as early as the beginning of this course it turns out that this is not unique as it's a suggest on the project web page a little bit disappointing the beautiful bizarre extravagant colors on an ordinary soap bubble are a wonder we learned the mechanism of this phenomenon in high school and now we may have the ability to render it by computers isn t it exciting this may be challenging or not that challenging students were able to render thin film interference seven years ago and renderman has routines for it too however in order to make these two pictures one still needs a lot of effort the following issues are what we must solve first of all we need to make a spectral representation of rays second we should implement the physics right third and also very difficult is to model the shape of the two faces of the bubble correctly i plan to read the paper foams and bubbles geometry and simulation intl j shape modeling 5 1 1999 pp 101 114 i got this information from google recently but have not yet got chance to read it feedback is eagerly anticipated email address zhangxh stanford edu the following pictures are just for fun all are from http bubbleart com they are guiness record holders last modified 05 22 03
