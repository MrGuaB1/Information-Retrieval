studies texture prefetching studies texture prefetching several studies including one done by hakura and gupta have demonstrated the efficiency of caching with respect to texture mapping however the latencies of texture memory systems is often too high to for a simple blocking cache and some sort of prefetching is required because the access patterns of texture mapping are constrained we designed a specialized prefetching architecture that can take advantage of them by separating the cache tags from the cache data in time and introducing a reorder buffer that holds prefetched cache blocks until they are needed by the cache we are able to prefetch data without worrying about conflicts introduced by prefetching a cycle accurate simulator has shown that the architecture covers arbitrarily high latencies with over 97 efficiency the primary developers of this prefetching texture cache architecture are homan igehy matthew eldridge and kekoa proudfoot details of the work can be found in the hwws 98 paper entitled prefetching in a texture cache architecture homan graphics stanford edu
