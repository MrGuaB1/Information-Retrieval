from rob thomas mailto robt cymru com sent sunday march 24 2002 1 07 pm to first teams subject another route server arises hi teams german martinez recently posted to nanog an announcement of a new route server route server opentransit net for those of you who don t know route servers are excellent tools to use when analyzing internet routing and connectivity issues are my prefixes there they can also be used when enduring a dos attack tracking the history of your prefix announcements etc i have several route servers listed in my secure bgp template for this reason i also run a route server and track a few key prefixes in my home lab brief tangent it's amazing how much garbage ends up in the internet routing table the simplest method of using a route server is to telnet to it there will be no login or password then issue the following command route server opentransit net sh ip bgp 198.41 0.4 bgp routing table entry for 198.41 0.0 24 version 51864 prefix paths 2 available best 1 number of paths and preferred path not advertised to any peer 3561 19836 as path eg asn hops 193.251 128.22 from 193.251 128.22 193.251 128.22 peer who gave route server this prefix origin igp metric 100 localpref 85 valid internal best this is the route used by route server 3561 19836 as path eg asn hops 193.251 129.18 from 193.251 129.18 193.251 129.18 peer who gave route server this prefix origin igp metric 100 localpref 85 valid internal the output tells us that 198.41 0.4 a root servers net is available to this route server through the announcement of the 198.41 0.0 24 prefix the origin asn origin network the right most asn is 19836 verisign network solutions this router can access this prefix through two transit bgp peers both in asn 3561 cable & wireless the as path is c&w 3561 verisign 19836 other prefixes might be reachable through multiple and different as paths eg 3549 6555 and 1 6555 i ll not bore you with the details regarding the origin igp metric localpref and other bits feel free to ping on me if you want to know what those mean so what might be an indicator of woe if the origin asn is not what you expect that could be bad if the prefix length in the example above 24 is different than what you expect that could be bad i would be particularly disturbed if the prefix length was more specific eg should be 20 but shows up as 24 thanks rob rob thomas http www cymru com robt
