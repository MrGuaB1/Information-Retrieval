task name ps2 bunch by bunch feedback r&d task name ps2 bunch by bunch feedback r&d study the relevance of coupled bunch instability in the ps2 reference design considering both transverse and longitudinal instabilities driven by both the fundamental rf cavity and hom impedances predict instability thresholds and growth rates modal pattern of unstable motion develop feedback system architecture estimate required performance and robustness of control consider necessary implementation via bunch by bunch wideband channels as well as rf feedback incorporated in low level rf systems design based on candidate cavity characteristics eg fnal booster cavities and conventional llrf feedbacks loops estimate feedback system parameters this includes overall gain noise effects and limits amplifier power & other parameters propose monitoring calibration system for day to day operations develop concepts for feedback kickers for longitudinal and transverse planes estimate their impedances the deliverable at the end of the period will be a white paper describing the feasibility of these systems a conceptual design of the longitudinal and transverse feedback systems the conceptual design will also include the impact of the fundamental rf system in the beam stability and the effect of noise in the beam performance why slac & lbnl slac and lbnl have a history of successful collaboration on feedback projects which we seek to maintain and deepen in the course of upgrading the pep ii feedbacks new experience was gained in kicker design and fabrication for longitudinal ad transverse kickers which is expected to be applicable to ps2 as well slac c rivetta j fox r akre a krasnykh u wienands kickers lbnl j corlett j byrd l doolittle w barry effort 0.5 fte fy09 1 fte fy10 travel 2 person weeks fy09 2 person weeks fy10
