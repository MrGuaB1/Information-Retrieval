libc info atof libc info atof go forward to atoi go backward to atexit go up to stdlib go to the top op libc atof atoff string to double or float synopsis include stdlib h double atof const char s float atoff const char s description atof converts the initial portion of a string to a double atoff converts the initial portion of a string to a float the functions parse the character string s locating a substring which can be converted to a floating point value the substring must match the format digits digits e e digits the substring converted is the longest initial fragment of s that has the expected format beginning with the first non whitespace character the substring is empty if str is empty consists entirely of whitespace or if the first non whitespace character is something other than or a digit atof s is implemented as strtod s null atoff s is implemented as strtof s null returns atof returns the converted substring value if any as a double or 0.0 if no conversion could be performed if the correct value is out of the range of representable values plus or minus huge_val is returned and erange is stored in errno if the correct value would cause underflow 0.0 is returned and erange is stored in errno atoff obeys the same rules as atof except that it returns a float portability atof is ansi c atof atoi and atol are subsumed by strod and strol but are used extensively in existing code these functions are less reliable but may be faster if the argument is verified to be in a valid range supporting os subroutines required close fstat isatty lseek read sbrk write created mon nov 8 17 42 52 2004 on tillpc with info_to_html version 0.9 6
