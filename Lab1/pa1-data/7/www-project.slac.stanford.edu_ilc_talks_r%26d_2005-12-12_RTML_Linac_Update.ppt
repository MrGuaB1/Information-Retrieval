rtml and linac design update rtml and linac design update pt 12 dec 2005 rtml ring to main linac baseline configuration developed and uploaded to bcd wiki most beamlines exist only as descriptions with very approximate lengths magnet counts etc bunch compressor exists as actual lattice files but still somewhat rough 2 stage raubenheimer tenenbaum wolski rtw design with fcdc wiggler configurations pt selected as rtml area group ag design guru with eun san kim willing to trade away the job for $1 a package of tic tacs rtml 2 next steps to proceed in paralllel start and or continue design of non controversial subsystems betatron collimation turnaround spin rotator study options for shortening system esk style single chicanes for bc enhanced fcdc wiggler elimination of 1 skew correction section and or 1 laser wire emittance station work with dr area group to define extraction region drx work with technical and global groups to begin costing of rtml main linac baseline configuration 8 cavity cryomodules 1 quad 4 modules curved to follow curvature of a cue ball earth ie mean radius of curvature 6370 km not mentioned in bcd but i like a 75 60 degree phase advance per cell positron production wiggler at 150 gev some controversy over bpm resolution and other diagnostics instrumentation many details still to be worked out main linac 2 k kubo has performed interesting studies on emittance preservation in curved main linac proposes tuning orbit such that  0 at d quads improves eases emittance tuning curvature so small that we can select this orbit or others during running ie the orbit described above does not constrain linac design or installation much work to be done on this general topic also in rtml and bds let meeting tentative plan to hold meeting of emittance police worldwide in early feb 2006 either at cern or at slac a real workshop plan to have sessions devoted to running simulations which would be reported on the next morning assign and collect homework all aspects of let emittance tuning diagnostics algorithms spin propagation
