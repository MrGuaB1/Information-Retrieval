modeling measuring and perceiving appearance modeling measuring and perceiving appearance instructors pat hanrahan hendrik lensch contents the appearance of the everyday world is influenced by many factors such as shape color texture reflection properties and the surrounding environment the causes of appearance have long been studied by scientists and of interest to almost anyone recently modeling and simulating appearance has been studied by researchers in computer graphics and computer vision by modeling the appearance of objects and materials we are able to render virtual versions of those objects by measuring appearance we are able to digitize real world objects and place them in new synthetic environments measurement techniques also allow us to experimentally validate different appearance models in computer vision texture and reflection models can be used to recognize scenes and objects in images here is some inspiration for the types of appearance we will be discussing diffuse glossy specular and anisotropic surfaces hair flowers objects with and without subsurface scattering the class is open to students with a background in computer graphics or computer vision the class may be taken for 1 or 3 credits for 1 credit each student will be expected to participate in all class activities for 3 credits a final project is also required location gates room 392 tuesdays and thursdays from 2 30 3 45pm technical lectures preliminaries hanrahan subsurface scattering i kubelka munk model hanrahan subsurface scattering ii hanrahan krueger model hanrahan subsurface scattering iii dipole bssrdf model hanrahan scattering from fibers hanrahan sensing for appearance acquisition lensch slices of the 8d reflectance field lensch model fitting and analysis lensch data driven models and representations lensch psychophysics of material perception hanrahan recognizing materials hanrahan links course schedule required and suggested readings previous version of the course
