linear collider monte carlo generators generators for us canada linear collider simulation project this page describes the monte carlo event generators which we feel are best suited for the lcd study linear collider physics studies need to take account of many properties of the initial and final states include smearing of the center of mass energy by beamstrahlung and initial state radiation polarization of the initial beams and propagation of polarization correlations to the final state we believe that it is preferable to use generators that contain this level of detail hopefully also in a manner that is straightforward to use for this reason we are using as our main generator the program pandora by michael peskin events from pandora can be processed with pythia and tauola to include final state gluon showering fragmentation and tau decays this is done automatically by the package pandora_pythia by masako iwasaki instructions downloading and using these programs can be found by following the links above the remainder of this page discusses status of pandora simulation of supersymmetry simulation of additional physics processes simulation of 4 and 6 parton backgrounds simulation of two photon backgrounds thorsten ohl's extensive list of monte carlo generators for linear collider studies can be found at this link note for experimentalist some detector simulators decay v0 particles during the detector simulation if you use such simulator you must stop the decay of such particles in the generator level for example if you want to use gismo you need to stop the decay of l0 k0 short k0 long s s+ x0 x w particles in the generator level but if you want to use lcd fastmc you need to decay them because lcd fastmc does not decay any particles status of pandora the 2.1 version of pandora sept 00 handles the following standard model processes e+ e q qbar 5 flavors e+ e t tbar e+ e l+ l l muon tau e+ e e+ e e+ e gamma gamma e+ e z gamma e+ e zz e+ e w+ w e+ e z higgs gamma gamma q qbar 5 flavors gamma gamma t tbar 5 flavors gamma gamma l+ l l muon tau gamma gamma e+ e gamma gamma w+ w gamma gamma higgs e gamma e gamma e z nu w e e e e all processes are simulated with parameterized beam distributions and initial state radiation and with full account of polarization at the parton level cross section formula are given at the tree level only a modified program for e e t tbar allows input of general production and decay form factors the simulation of the higgs boson allows input of arbitrary partial widths for 10 possible decay modes simulation of supersymmetry supersymmetry processes are simulated by the program isajet effects of beamstrahlung isr and polarization effects are included in isajet 7.42 and above for further information see the isajet manual supersymmetry reactions without account for beam polarization are also included in recent versions of pythia simulation of additional physics processes for processes not simulated by pandora but which are included in pythia beamstrahlung can be added using the program pybms the pybms program is interfaced to pythia version 5.7 a sample shell script containing an interface to pythia and nlc machine parameters for ecm 0.5 1.0 1.5 tev is included in the pybms package simulation of 4 and 6 parton backgrounds though pandora does include finite widths for w z and t it does not correctly simulate multi parton final states in which these particles are far from mass shell this requires a dedicated multi parton event generator a number of these are available from ohl's archive in principle a multi parton generator put into the format of a pandora process can make use of pandora's the beam simulation for further details see the pandora documentation simulation of two photon backgrounds hard gamma gamma processes can be treated by pandora and pandora_pythia soft gamma gamma processes are not included and must be simulated by pythia and by a dedicated two photon generator one such program is bbhad which uses isajet for the simulation of soft hadronic reactions a sample shell script of bbhad containing adjustable gamma gamma hadron parameters and nlc machine parameters for ecm 0.5 1.0 1.5 tev is included in the bbhad package please send comments on these pages to masako iwasaki and or michael peskin world wide lc study next linear collider me peskin slac
