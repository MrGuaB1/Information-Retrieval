stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource event seminar toward unbiased 3d reconstruction of flexible single particles stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource an office of science user facility seminar series home about the seminar series attending a lecture past lectures maps & directions home toward unbiased 3d reconstruction of flexible single particles cryo electron microscopy and single particle 3d reconstruction plays a pivotal role in the difficult and pressing challenge of determining the structures of large macromolecular complexes such as ribosomes and general transcription factors molecular volumes are generated by aligning large sets of very noisy 2d projection images with unknown and random orientations in 3d before volume interpolation the increasing popularity of single particle methods in structural biology is highly correlated with technical advances in instrumentation and computation in this talk stanford postdoc hans olof elmlund will present new computational tools for ab initio 3d reconstruction from challenging single particle populations low contrast no symmetry significant degree of structural heterogeneity etc the methods do not rely on a priori information about the structure or the sample heterogeneity making them applicable to a wide range of single particles i will introduce the core algorithms of simple single particle image processing linux engine and give examples of reconstructions that have given insights into the fundamental biological processes of transcription and translation date time april 20 2011 3 00 pm location slac redtail hawk conference room 108a speaker hans olof elmlund stanford postdoctoral research fellow structural biology tags cryo electron microscopy single particle 3d reconstruction structural biology share printer friendly version post to twitter send to friend send to friend the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource is a directorate of slac national accelerator laboratory which is operated by stanford university for the department of energy other news sources slac today ssrl headlines symmetry magazine lightsources org interactions org ilc newsline spires slac national accelerator laboratory slac national accelerator laboratory menlo park ca operated by stanford university for the us department of energy office of science content owner cathy knotts privacy notice security notice and terms of use doe stanford university
