colon sankaranarayanan sipma linear invariant generation using non linear constraint solving linear invariant generation using non linear constraint solving michael colon sriram sankaranarayanan henny sipma we present a new method for the generation of linear invariants which reduces the problem to a non linear constraint solving problem our method based on farkas lemma synthesizes linear invariants by extracting non linear constraints on the coefficients of a target invariant from a program these constraints guarantee that the linear invariant is inductive we then apply existing techniques including specialized quantifier elimination methods over the reals to solve these non linear constraints our method has the advantage of being complete for inductive invariants to our knowledge this is the first sound and complete technique for generating inductive invariants of this form we illustrate the practicality of our method on several examples including cases in which traditional methods based on abstract interpretation with widening fail to generate sufficiently strong invariants in computer aided verification cav lncs 2725 springer verlag pp 420 433 2003 postscript pdf 2003 springer verlag henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu last modified thu jan 12 14 40 50 pdt 2004
