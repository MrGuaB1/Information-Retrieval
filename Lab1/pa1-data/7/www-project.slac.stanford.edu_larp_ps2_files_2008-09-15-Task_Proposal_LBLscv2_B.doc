space charge effects studies space charge effects compensation and interface with collimation studies space charge effects have been identified as the most serious intensity limitation in the cern ps and ps booster 1 since linear and nonlinear space charge effects in high intensity hadron beam can cause significant emittance growth halo formation and particle losses these effects put a strong limit to the attainable intensity for a synchrotron accelerator such as ps2 using long time self consistent particle tracking will help to better understand space charge effects and study potential methods to compensate these effects it will also provide a more realistic input for collimator design to remove unwanted halo particles we will perform long term simulations with realistic modeling of lattice elements and inclusion of fully 3d space charge effects we will characteriz e space charge effects on dynamic aperture and beam quality halo formation etc with the high level statistics made possible by recourse to massively parallel computing we will also include the study of machine impedance single bunch effects on beam dynamics in the presence of space charge we will then investigate p roposed space charge compensation schemes using octupoles pole face windings electron lens or neutralization 1 we will evaluate these compensation schemes and the po ssible limitations to their use arising for example from resonance excitation and coherent instabilities we will build a computational framework enabl ing work flow between the space charge beam dynamics simulation s and the collimator design tool s thus support ing the effort of the collimator designers for these studies we intend to apply the codes impact and marylie impact augmented with the capabilities needed for proper simulation of ps2 beam dynamics eg modeling of lattice elements with time dependent magnetic fields using a ps2 lattice we will perform numerical tests to determine required simulation parameters order of transfer maps number of space charge kicks etc to achieve acceptable numerical accuracy for fy09 and beyond we plan to have three researchers robert ryne ji qiang macro venturini with a total 1 fte per year effort to work on the space charge simulation for ps2 this effort will include collaborations with other larp labs 1 m aiba et al space charge compensation options for the lhc injector complex in proceeding of pac07 3390 2007
