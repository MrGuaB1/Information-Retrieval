gdb info overlay sample program gdb info overlay sample program go backward to automatic overlay debugging go up to overlays go to the top op gdb overlay sample program when linking a program which uses overlays you must place the overlays at their load addresses while relocating them to run at their mapped addresses to do this you must write a linker script note overlay description ld info overlay description unfortunately since linker scripts are specific to a particular host system target architecture and target memory layout this manual cannot provide portable sample code demonstrating gdb's overlay support however the gdb source distribution does contain an overlaid program with linker scripts for a few systems as part of its test suite the program consists of the following files from gdb testsuite gdb base overlays c the main program file ovlymgr c a simple overlay manager used by overlays c foo c bar c baz c grbx c overlay modules loaded and used by overlays c d10v ld m32r ld linker scripts for linking the test program on the d10v elf and m32r elf targets you can build the test program using the d10v elf gcc cross compiler like this d10v elf gcc g c overlays c d10v elf gcc g c ovlymgr c d10v elf gcc g c foo c d10v elf gcc g c bar c d10v elf gcc g c baz c d10v elf gcc g c grbx c d10v elf gcc g overlays o ovlymgr o foo o bar o baz o grbx o wl td10v ld o overlays the build process is identical for any other architecture except that you must substitute the appropriate compiler and linker script for the target system for d10v elf gcc and d10v ld created mon nov 8 17 42 37 2004 on tillpc with info_to_html version 0.9 6
