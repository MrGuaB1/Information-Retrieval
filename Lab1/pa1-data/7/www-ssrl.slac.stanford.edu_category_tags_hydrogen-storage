hydrogen storage stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource an office of science user facility home hydrogen storage hydrogen storage in platinum single walled carbon nanotube composites at near ambient conditions through spillover mechanism posted 2011 to expand the use of hydrogen in mobile applications such as hydrogen powered buses and cars researchers will need to design lightweight compact means of storing it one possible method is to store hydrogen inside carbon nanotubes theoretical predictions suggest that through a mechanism that forms stable carbon hydrogen bonds it would be possible to store one hydrogen atom for every carbon atom inside single walled carbon nanotubes read more schematic of the spillover mechanism hydrogen storage goes nano 2011 carbon nanotubes doped with a suitable metal catalyst represent viable materials for hydrogen storage read more syndicate content the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource is a directorate of slac national accelerator laboratory which is operated by stanford university for the department of energy other news sources slac today ssrl headlines symmetry magazine lightsources org interactions org ilc newsline spires slac national accelerator laboratory slac national accelerator laboratory menlo park ca operated by stanford university for the us department of energy office of science content owner cathy knotts privacy notice security notice and terms of use doe stanford university
