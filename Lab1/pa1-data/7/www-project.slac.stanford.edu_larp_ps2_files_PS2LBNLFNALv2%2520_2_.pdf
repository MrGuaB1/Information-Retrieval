space charge effects characterization compensation and interface with collimation studies space charge effects have been ide page 1 space charge effects characterization compensation and interface with collimation studies space charge effects have been identified as the most serious intensity limitation in the cern ps and ps booster 1 since linear and nonlinear space charge effects in high intensity hadron beams can cause significant emittance growth halo formation and particle losses these effects put a strong limit on the attainable intensity for a synchrotron accelerator such as ps2 using long time self consistent particle tracking will help to better understand space charge effects and study potential methods to compensate these effects it will also provide a more realistic input for collimator design to remove unwanted halo particles in fy09 we propose to perform long term simulations with realistic modeling of lattice elements and inclusion of fully 3d space charge effects we will characterize space charge effects on dynamic aperture and beam quality halo formation etc with the high level statistics made possible by recourse to massively parallel computing we will also include the study of machine impedance single bunch effects on beam dynamics in the presence of space charge in addition during fy09 we will begin to investigate possible space charge compensation schemes using octupoles pole face windings electron lens or neutralization 1 we will evaluate these compensation schemes and the possible limitations to their use arising for example from resonance excitation and coherent instabilities in subsequent years we will finalize the space charge compensation studies and we will build a computational framework that will enable work flow between the space charge beam dynamics simulations and the collimator design tools that are used in the ps2 design project thus supporting the effort of the collimator designers in fy09 the studies described above will be performed in the context of the scidac2 compass project as a joint task of fnal and lbnl we will apply the codes impact marylie impact and synergia augmented when necessary with capabilities needed for proper simulation of ps2 beam dynamics eg modeling of lattice elements with time dependent magnetic fields using a ps2 lattice we will perform numerical tests to determine required simulation parameters order of transfer maps number of space charge kicks etc and comparisons between the different codes and approaches to achieve acceptable numerical accuracy the compass codes are a very good match for these studies impact is a 3d parallel pic code though it is used mainly for ion and electron linac simulation it has also been used to model space charge emittance exchange in the ps page 2 impact has multiple poisson solvers including solvers to treat a variety of boundary conditions and a solver based on an integrated green function igf technique the code allows for detailed modeling of rf accelerating and focusing structures machine error studies and inclusion of wakefield effects marylie impact ml i is a hybrid code combining the space charge modeling capabilities of an early version of impact with the nonlinear optics capabilities of marylie the code allows for transfer map generation map analysis particle tracking with space charge and envelope tracking all within a single environment ml i has a fully 5th order optics capability including a recently added 5th order rf cavity model 2 synergia is a self consistent fully 3d pic simulation framework capable of running on massively parallel machines several aspects of synergia make it well suited to this task synergia utilizes the non linear single particle tracking from chef allowing us to accurately model the non trivial lattice elements proposed for space charge mitigation efforts in the ps synergia has been successfully used to model space charge effects in other low energy proton machines such as the fermilab booster we have recently added a resistive wall module to synergia that has been used to model single and multiple bunch effects in the fermilab main injector synergia is a python based extensible framework allowing us to perform dynamic simulations utilizing ramping and feedback schemes for fy09 we plan to have four researchers james amundson fnal ji qiang lbnl robert ryne lbnl and panagiotis spentzouris fnal with total effort of 1 fte funded through scidac2 to work on the space charge simulation for ps2 1 m aiba et al space charge compensation options for the lhc injector complex in proceeding of pac07 3390 2007 2 d abell numerical computation of high order transfer maps for rf cavities prst ab 9 052001 2006
