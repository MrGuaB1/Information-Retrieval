space electronics physics list space electronics physics list last modified description the space electronics physics list contains the physics processes required to run simulations of micro electronics applications in a space environment this list represents the current best guess as to the appropriate models and processes for such applications as new or improved models become available the physics list will be updated a more detailed description of the physics list is available test modules not yet implemented several modules are provided as regression tests in order to compare physics results from release to release of geant4 these modules are based on simplified detector geometries thin target tests detector tests validation not yet implemented validation tests are provided to compare physics results from experiments and test beams these are based on realistic detector geometries for each test a set of comparison plots are maintained test1 test2 dennis wright
