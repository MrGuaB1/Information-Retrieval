assignment 1 bad photos assignment 1 bad photos alice alice che this fulfills requirements 1 3 and 5 i ve wanted to try custom shaped bokeh for a really long time and this assignment seemed like the perfect time to do so i cut out a heart shape in black construction paper and created a cover for my 50mm lens this is a shot of christmas lights which i arranged into the shape of a heart as well i deliberately ignored the rule of thirds and centered it in the photo i also deliberately underexposed the photo as i only wanted the lights to be showing i turned off the lights in the room and closed the blinds i kept the iso low and bumped the shutter speed up until it was underexposed enough to suit my taste there was minimal photoshopping i increased the blacks in adobe camera raw because originally some of the wires were showing previous back to all photos next
