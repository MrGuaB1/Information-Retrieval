fuel cell electrocatalysts fuel cell electrocatalysts electrocatalytic energy conversion processes are expected to play a major role in the development of sustainable technologies to mitigate global warming and to lower our dependence on fossil fuels specifically the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell pemfc an electrochemical energy conversion device is potentially useful as a power source in the transportation sector one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases and consumers of fossil fuels and possibly for stationary power generation however efficient and stable fuel cell electrocatalysts are largely lacking and much effort is presently being directed toward developing such catalysts my research focuses on understanding these and to develop more stable and inexpensive catalysts research projects in fuel cell electrocatalysts cu 3 pt nano particles link to ssrl science highlight chengfei yu's thesis defense single crystal cu 3 pt 111 dealloying thin film dealloying
