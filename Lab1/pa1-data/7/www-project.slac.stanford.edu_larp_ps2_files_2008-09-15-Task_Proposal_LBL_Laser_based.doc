laser based h stripping injection laser based h stripping injection we will identify a laser and buildup cavity design capable of meeting the repetition rate intensity and other requirements the preferred technology would be diode pumped solid state which is capable of high power at high efficiency with excellent stability and reliability most laser components can be commercially purchased except possibly the power amplifier which may have to be custom built but is well within the state of the art a laser control system will be designed to synchronize the laser with the machine cycle we will design a power buildup cavity to achieve the required intensity with minimal laser power input improving cavity energy storage will reduce requirements on the laser power amp thus reducing cost a control system will be designed to lock the cavity resonance to the laser carrier frequency cavity design will be coordinated with design of the accelerator components to take account of radiation and vacuum requirements due to the expected small size of the laser it may be possible to locate it near the interaction point minimizing transport optics we will investigate ways to integrate the laser with the stripping assembly in addition we will work in collaboration with the colleagues at sns to perform an analysis and provide enough input to the design of the injection optics to optimize performance of this injection scheme in such collaboration we will provide input and contribute to machine studies planned at sns when they will support a feasibility study of this approach for the ps2 the deliverable at the end of the period will be a white paper describing the feasibility of this system a conceptual design of both the laser and the corresponding injection optics our estimate for this work is 1 2 fte per year in fy09 and fy10 plus 20k yr in travel both to cern and sns personnel for lbnl will be lead by russell wilcox and include john byrd alex ratti and a collaboration with sns scientists
