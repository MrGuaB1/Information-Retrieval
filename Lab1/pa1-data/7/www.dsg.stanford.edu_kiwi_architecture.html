architecture architecture in a kiwi network access points aps are simple devices controlled by a centralized wireless appliance wa the wa is responsible for tasks such as client authentication localization access point load balancing and channel assignment in terms of functionality the demands put on the aps are modest with most of the services performed by the wa effectively aps are simply remote radio interfaces in a 802.11 network aps would handle control frames and forward management and encrypted data frames to the wa our ideas closely follow the design of industry standards such as lwapp capwap and the philosophy is the same make access points as cheap and simple as possible and place most of the functionality in the wa which is computationally more powerful this architecture possesses three important properties first the lower ap prices allows for faster and cheaper deployment instead of performing a site survey to determine the best location for a few access points the administrator can increase the number of aps and install them in a uniform fashion eg a grid second the higher density of access points decreases the average distance between clients and aps increasing communication quality and decreasing undesired coverage outside the service area finally it allows for a localization system to achieve better accuracy given the increased number of vantage points
