spreadsheets for images spreadsheets for images the majority of commercially available image processing and data visualization systems employ a dataflow paradigm users select modules from a menu and wire them together using an interactive flow chart editor we are investigating an alternative paradigm based on spreadsheets cells in such a spreadsheet contain graphical objects such as images volumes movies cells may also contain graphical widgets such as buttons sliders or movie viewers objects are displayed in miniature inside each cell formulas for cells are written in a programming language that includes operators for array manipulation image processing and rendering this project is currently inactive however if a stanford student is looking for a challenging software project i d like to productize this package for distribution to the visualization community there are also several interesting extensions one could make to the package possibly requiring fresh research one extension would be to add geometric models for example dense polygon meshes as a fundamental datatype another extension would be to reimplement the image processing and other operators using image pyramids so that processing cost is proportional to the size of the rendered image in each spreadsheet cell when the cells are small computations are fast if the user stretches the spreadsheet the cells get bigger and computations slow down if the user clicks on a cell that cell is recalculated at full resolution people marc levoy recent papers in this area spreadsheets for images marc levoy proc siggraph 94 if images on this page look dark to you see our note about gamma correction a list of technical papers with abstracts and pointers to additional information is also available or you can return to the research projects page or our home page copyright 1995 marc levoy last update february 19 2006 11 37 21 pm
