a modified szilard engine thomas hyer stanford linear accelerator center stanford university stanford ca 94309 abstract we page 1 slac pub 6482 may 1994 t a modified szilard engine thomas hyer stanford linear accelerator center stanford university stanford ca 94309 abstract we propose a modification of the szilard engine which seems to circumvent the problem of accumulation of information the second law of thermodynamics which states that the entropy of any closed system may not spontaneously decrease seems at first sight to be violated by the possibility of a maxwell's demon which filters molecules of a gas according to their energy thus creating a temperature gradient within a closed system at constant energy the reductio ad absurdam of the maxwell demon is termed the szilard engine shown in fig 1 it consists of a chamber containing a single molecule and a partition which may be used to divide the chamber into two parts when the partition is raised it confines the molecule to half of the original volume apparently decreasing the entropy of the system the contradiction with the second law is made apparent if we imagine reversibly closing the empty half of the chamber then lifting the partition and converting the pressure from the molecule to usable work as the chamber expands again to its original size work supported by department of energy contract de ac03 76sf00515 submitted to physical review e 1
