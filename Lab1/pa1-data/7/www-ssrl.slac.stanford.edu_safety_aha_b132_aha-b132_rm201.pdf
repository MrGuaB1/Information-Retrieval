hazard analysis system for slac personnel page 1 area hazard analysis work form title spear rf waveguide penetration to ring location bldg & rm 132 201 instructions an area hazard analysis aha is a process that is used to evaluate a work area to 1 determine the hazards that may be present 2 determine appropriate controls for these hazards and 3 provide a mechanism to communicate these hazards to someone entering the area the aha covers the facility and equipment within the facility it does not cover specific jobs tasks that may be performed in the area job task specific hazards and controls are covered by the jham process the aha should be done by the area manager in cooperation with the building manager an aha should be done once for all working areas and whenever there is a change in to the facility or regulations or the introduction of new equipment or new hazard enter information into boxes which will expand to accommodate whatever length of text is entered once this aha is complete the area responsible person signs processes equipment in area hazards recommended controls & actions ionizing radiation prompt potential ill health effects of radiation exposure locked gate under control of spear operations x2751 prevents access to room radiation personnel exclusion area sign posted radiation area sign posted dosimeter required for entry into building if room is to be accessed while rf is on but with no electron beam use victoreen 450b survey meter or equivalent to insure no radiation from dark current in cavities is in room concrete and lead shielding blocks installed as required to minimize radiation to alara levels report any instances of detached shielding to spear operations x2751 comply with slac radiation safety rules non ionizing radiation prompt at 476.3 mhz potential ill health effects from non ionizing radiation exposure all flanges connecting output of klystron to all other high power rf components are securely fastened together rf sealing gaskets used where necessary between flanges active interlock trips klystron output when waveguide pressure decreases below safety threshold administrative checks of non ionizing radiation generated by system made periodically per spear3 rf system rf non ionizing radiation safety procedure ps 444 410 06 r1 made to o measure levels of 476.3 mhz radiation present in room page 2 o verify flange bolts are tightened to appropriate torque specifications recheck non ionizing radiation levels per ps 444 410 06 r1 after any work to waveguide system report any instances of defective flange connections to spear operations x2751 trip hazards from o anchor bolts in concrete o cable tray o shielding blocks o lcw and hcw pipes o standing water on external shielding blocks during wet weather periods o pigeon droppings potential injury from falls orange safety covers placed over anchor bolts screens and netting used to minimize access by pigeons use extreme caution when accessing and working in room elevated noise levels from 150 gpm hcw flow potential loss of hearing from prolonged exposure use appropriate ppe hearing protection during prolonged periods of work in this building high pressure hcw system for cooling loads potential injury from high pressure water flow from either water system use appropriate lock and tag procedures when work on either water system is required report any water leaks to spear operations x2751 mechanical obstructions o waveguide supports o a frame building beams potential injury from sharp edges or head injury from hitting elevated beams and or cables use extreme caution when working around waveguide support frames use extreme caution when walking near wall where a frame beams are below head height completed by print name date area responsible ed guerra august 4 2008 participants
