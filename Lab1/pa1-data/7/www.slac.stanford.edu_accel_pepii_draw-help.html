database intro pep ii drawing numbers and drawing titles the pep ii drawing database is designed to contain all the drawing documentation for the pep ii project included are mechanical electrical and facilities drawings generated by all three collaborators slac lbl and llnl the input into the database is controlled at slac drawings from other sites are assigned a slac number and cross referenced to the foreign drawing number within the database included also in the database are drawings from other projects at slac which were reused by pep ii those drawings retain their original drawing number pep ii drawings are organized following the project work breakdown structure drawing numbers start with a two letter prefix denoting the type of drawing per slac design standard ds 016 310 01 followed by 8 numbers all pep drawings start with 34 the third number is assigned per the system her ler etc for mechanical drawings the 4th number is assigned by discipline magnets vacuum etc drawing titles are three lines of up to 25 characters each standardized first line titles were outlined in pep tech note 16 as follows 340 0xx xx pep ii top assemblies 340 1xx xx pep ii magnets 340 2xx xx pep ii mag power 340 3xx xx pep ii rf system 340 4xx xx pep ii vacuum 340 5xx xx pep ii feedback 340 6xx xx pep ii diagnostics 340 7xx xx pep ii installation 340 8xx xx pep ii alignment 340 9xx xx pep ii supports 341 0xx xx pep ii her top assembly 341 1xx xx pep ii her magnets 341 2xx xx pep ii her mag power 341 3xx xx pep ii her rf system 341 4xx xx pep ii her vacuum 341 5xx xx pep ii her feedback 341 6xx xx pep ii her diagnostics 341 7xx xx pep ii her installation 341 8xx xx pep ii her alignment 341 9xx xx pep ii her supports 342 0xx xx pep ii ler top assembly 342 1xx xx pep ii ler magnets 342 2xx xx pep ii ler mag power 342 3xx xx pep ii ler rf system 342 4xx xx pep ii ler vacuum 342 5xx xx pep ii ler feedback 342 6xx xx pep ii ler diagnostics 342 7xx xx pep ii ler installation 342 8xx xx pep ii ler alignment 342 9xx xx pep ii ler supports 343 0xx xx pep ii ir top assembly 343 1xx xx pep ii ir magnets 343 2xx xx pep ii ir mag power 343 3xx xx pep ii ir rf system 343 4xx xx pep ii ir vacuum 343 5xx xx pep ii ir feedback 343 6xx xx pep ii ir diagnostics 343 7xx xx pep ii ir installation 343 8xx xx pep ii ir alignment 343 9xx xx pep ii ir supports 344 0xx xx pep ii inj top assembly 344 1xx xx pep ii inj magnets 344 2xx xx pep ii inj mag power 344 3xx xx pep ii inj rf system 344 4xx xx pep ii inj vacuum 344 5xx xx pep ii inj feedback 344 6xx xx pep ii inj diagnostics 344 7xx xx pep ii inj installation 344 8xx xx pep ii inj alignment 344 9xx xx pep ii inj supports 345 1xx xx pep ii controls drawings used for facilities design the 346 series are broken down by discipline numbers as follows 000 thru 099 general & civil 100 thru 199 architectural 300 thru 399 structural 400 thru 499 mechanical 500 thru 599 chilled water 600 thru 699 hvac & compresed air 700 thru 799 electrical 800 thru 899 vendor drawings 900 thru 999 fire alarm facilities drawings carry a four line title in order to incorporate them into the pepii drawing database the first line tittles in the database have been standardized to include information from the first two lines of the drawing format as follows 346 0xx xx pep ii util general & civil 346 1xx xx pep ii util architectural 346 3xx xx pep ii util structural 346 4xx xx pep ii util mechanical 346 5xx xx pep ii chilled water 346 6xx xx pep ii util hvac & compressed air 346 7xx xx pep ii util electrical abbreviations in titles follow the ansi standard as much as possible and commonly used acronyms such as dip for distributed ion pump are often used to query for a drawing one can use part of a number part of a title or combination thereof
