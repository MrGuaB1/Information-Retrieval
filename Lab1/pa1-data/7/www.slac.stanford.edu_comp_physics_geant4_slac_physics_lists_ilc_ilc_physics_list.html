linear collider physics lists linear collider physics list last modified description the linear collider physics list contains the physics processes both electromagnetic and hadronic required to run a linear collider detector simulation the initial high energy event must be provided by an event generator chosen by the user this list represents the current best guess as to the appropriate models and processes for such detectors as new or improved models become available the physics list will be updated a more detailed description of the physics list is available getting the physics list the physics list directory can be downloaded as follows cvs d pserver anonymous cvs freehep org cvs lcd co lcphys test modules not yet implemented several modules are provided as regression tests in order to compare physics results from release to release of geant4 these modules are based on simplified detector geometries thin target tests detector tests validation not yet implemented validation tests are provided to compare physics results from experiments and test beams these are based on realistic detector geometries for each test a set of comparison plots are maintained test1 test2 dennis wright
