assignment 6 landscape and nature assignment 6 landscape and nature andrea andrea yung after this photo was taken at bayshore park and fulfills requirements 1 and 2 as you can see the original picture was very hazy so i adjusted the picture with curves then i selectively adjusted the blue channel of the sky to make it more dynamic i like how just one s curved path disrupts the whole symmetry of the picture taken at 1 250 f 18 previous back to all photos next
