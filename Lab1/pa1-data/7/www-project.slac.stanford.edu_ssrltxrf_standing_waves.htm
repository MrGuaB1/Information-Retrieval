standing waves home up feedback contents please note wafer level txrf measurements are no longer available details on txrf home page home up standing wave phenomena occur when the incident and reflected x ray beams constructively interfere with each other it is well known that when two traveling wave solutions are superposed upon each other a standing wave solution is generated with twice the electric field vector since the intensity is proportional to the electric field 2 any fluorescence x rays emitted from the standing wave region can be increased by a factor of 4 but this increase is usually less due to absorption effects from r klockenkaemper et al analytical chemistry 64 1115 1992 for our experimental setup the standing waves enhance the fluorescence intensities seen by the detector and therefore lead to better detection limits send mail to pianetta stanford edu with questions or comments about this web site last modified january 26 2007
