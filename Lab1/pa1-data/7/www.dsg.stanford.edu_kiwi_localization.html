localization robust localization to be used for security purposes a localization system needs to be robust against malicious devices that try to obfuscate their locations additionally in order to scale to large numbers of access points usually incrementally deployed and often relocated it should minimize operator assistance during reconfiguration we present a signal strength based localization system that takes advantage of the increasing number of access points to provide a service that is both robust and self configurable using measurements in a real deployment we show that the system can autonomously establish an approximate model for signal attenuation within a service area eg an office building using the access points already deployed with no operator involvement and thus no additional costs it can be used for security applications because it is configured to reject signal strength patterns for which it has low confidence we show that in our testbed clients are located accurately median error of 1.88 meters and rejected with low probability less than 1 of measured locations we demonstrate that mounting undetected attacks outside the service area can only happen in close proximity less than 20 meters even with unbounded power and directional antennas relevant publications
