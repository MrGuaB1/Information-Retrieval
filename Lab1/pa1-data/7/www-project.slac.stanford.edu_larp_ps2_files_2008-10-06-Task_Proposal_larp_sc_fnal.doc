proposed studies of space charge and resistive wall effects in the cern ps and ps booster proposed studies of space charge and resistive wall effects in the cern ps and ps booster we propose to study space charge and resistive wall effects and various compensation schemes in the cern ps and ps booster utilizing synergia synergia is a self consistent fully 3d pic simulation framework capable of running on massively parallel machines several aspects of synergia make it well suited to this task synergia utilizes the non linear single particle tracking from chef allowing us to accurately model the non trivial lattice elements proposed for space charge mitigation efforts in the ps synergia has been successfully used to model space charge effects in other low energy proton machines such as the fermilab booster we have recently added a resistive wall module to synergia that has been used to model single and multiple bunch effects in the fermilab main injector synergia is a python based extensible framework allowing us to perform dynamic simulations utilizing ramping and feedback schemes our proposal is to perform large scale simulations of the cern ps and ps booster with space charge and single and multi bunch resistive wall effects we will then simulate the octupole and pole winding compensation techniques as discussed by aiba et al we will examine emittance growth tune footprints with and without compensation and halo formation and growth we will extend synergia with a new high statistics halo model for accurate simulation of halo particles which will provide accurate input for collimator design efforts these simulations will be on parallel machines typical synergia simulations use millions of core particles we will determine the optimal number of core particles and halo particles as well as other simulation parameters based on our early simulations
