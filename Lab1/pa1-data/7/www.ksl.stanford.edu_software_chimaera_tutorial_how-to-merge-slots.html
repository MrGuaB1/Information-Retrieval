how to merge slots how to merge slots intoduction back next in this section you will learn how to merge two slots into one slot select show slots mode from the mode menu in this mode direct template slots of classes can be seen indented under the classes to which they are attached this mode is not initially used when merging the classes of onotologies but it is important later on when merging the slots of ontologies when you are in show slots mode red triangles appear to the right of classes indicating those classes that have direct template slots opening a slot triangle reveals the slots attached to a class click on the red triangle to the right of weapon of mass destruction to reveal its slots when you merged the weapon of mass destruction from saic products and the weapon of mass destruction from cyc products you created a class that has two very similar slots range of destruction and destruction range you are going to merge these two slots into one slot named range of destruction click on range of destruction to highlight it now highlight destruction range by clicking on it also make sure that these are the only two frames highlighted you are now ready to merge these two slots select merge slots from the slot menu your display should now show one slot range of destruction under weapon of mass destruction you may want to examine the slots in your merged ontology using slot traversal mode to put chimaera in this mode select slot traversal from the mode menu in this mode you are guided through the taxonomy of the current kb your attention is focused on any classes that have experienced some taxonomic edit resulting in there being slots from different source files in the class's frame definition this can give you a valuable checklist to allow the exhaustive traversal of the kb looking for areas in which slot merges might be performed or constraints might be applied in the next section you will learn how to diagnose a kb using chimaera intoduction back next
