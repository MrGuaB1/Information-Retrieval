end of rhel4 sl4 support slac national accelerator laboratory computing division end of support for rhel4 and sl4 slac computing unix at slac linux at slac updated 26 oct 2011 vendor support for red hat enterprise linux 4 rhel4 and scientific linux 4 sl4 is scheduled to end in february 2012 29 feb 2012 for rhel4 and 2 feb 2012 for sl4 after those dates there will be no further security patches for these linux distributions slac's computing division has set a goal of either upgrading or retiring as many rhel4 and sl4 machines as possible by 9 dec 2011 to achieve this goal we are taking the following steps new installs effective immediately we are imposing a moratorium on new installations of rhel4 or sl4 desktops users of rhel4 and sl4 desktop systems should be contacted in the near future by their it departmental support person to schedule an upgrade to a newer release of rhel or to retire the system as soon as possible public machines there are currently several pools of rhel4 and sl4 machines available for public login pool names os rhel4 32 rhel4 32 test 32 bit rhel4 rhel4 64 rhel4 64 test 64 bit rhel4 sl4 32 sl4 32 test 32 bit sl4 in the near future we will limit access to these systems see below batch machines the only rhel4 sl4 resources in the public batch farm are three batch build machines server name os bldlnx01 32 bit sl4 bldlnx02 32 bit sl4 bldlnx09 64 bit rhel4 in the near future we will limit access to these systems see below we will work with the owners of private rhel4 batch clusters to either upgrade or retire their systems servers there are a number of other rhel4 sl4 servers currently in use we will be contacting the users responsible for these servers to plan for their upgrade or retirement milestones 15 nov 2011 restricted access to rhel4 sl4 public login and batch build machines on tuesday morning 15 nov we will restrict access to the following pools of public machines rhel4 32 and rhel4 32 test rhel4 64 and rhel4 64 test sl4 32 and sl4 32 test current users of these pools should begin using one of the other pools of public interactive compute servers pool names os rhel6 32 rhel6 32 test 32 bit rhel6 rhel6 64 rhel6 64 test 64 bit rhel6 rhel5 32 aka noric yakut rhel5 32 test 32 bit rhel5 rhel5 64 rhel5 64 test 64 bit rhel5 also on tuesday 15 nov we will restrict access to the rhel4 sl4 batch build machines bldlnx01 32 bit sl4 bldlnx02 32 bit sl4 bldlnx09 64 bit rhel4 the lsf batch queue bld4q has been established to allow a restricted group of users to run rhel4 sl4 build jobs these servers have been removed from all other build queues if you believe you will have a critical dependence on one of these rhel4 sl4 login pools or batch build systems after 15 nov please send an email to unix admin slac stanford edu explaining which pool s or build machine s you need to access why you need access and how you plan to eliminate this dependency by the 9 december 2011 target date 9 dec 2011 slac target for eliminating rhel4 sl4 16 dec 2011 last day before slac winter closure 2 feb 2012 vendor eol for scientific linux 4 29 feb 2012 vendor eol for red hat enterprise linux 4 len moss
