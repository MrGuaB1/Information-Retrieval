zhang sipma manna decision procedures for term algebras with integer constraints decision procedures for term algebras with integer constraints ting zhang henny sipma zohar manna term algebras can model recursive data structures which are widely used in programming languages to verify programs we must be able to reason about these structures however as programming languages often involve multiple data domains in program verification decision procedures for a single theory are usually not applicable an important class of emph mixed constraints consists of combinations of data structures with integer constraints on the size of data structures such constraints can express memory safety properties such as absence of memory overflow and out of bound array access which are crucial for program correctness in this paper we extend the theory of term algebras with the length function which maps a term to its size resulting in a combined theory of term algebras and presburger arithmetic this arithmetic extension provides a natural but tight coupling between the two theories and hence the general purpose combination methods like nelson oppen combination are not applicable we present decision procedures for quantifier free theories in structures with an infinite constant domain and with a finite constant domain we also present a quantifier elimination procedure for the extended first order theory that can remove a block of existential quantifiers in one step in information and computation volume 204 pp 1526 1574 october 2006 postscript pdf 2006 elsevier inc henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu
