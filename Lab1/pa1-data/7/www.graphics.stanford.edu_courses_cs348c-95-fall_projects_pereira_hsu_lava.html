modeling lava flows modeling lava flows with a particle system cs348c final project by lucas pereira and david hsu volcanos and lava volcanos around the world exhibit a wide range of behavior some of them like mount st helens in washington erupt violently spewing millions of tons of gases ash and cinders into the atmosphere other volcanos like kilauea in hawaii emit a continuous flow of lava for our project we attempted to model continuous lava flows such as these results we generated a movie of lava flowing down a volcano the camera pans around the volcano while the sun sets giving views of the volcano under different lighting conditions lava mpg 453 kb implementation the lava was modeled with a particle system and the volcano was modeled as a height field over a grid this implementation allowed us to simulate particle motion heat transfer and volcano formation we made optimizations to improve efficiency sometimes at the expense of physical accuracy for more details see our implementation page authors david hsu dyhsu cs stanford edu lucas pereira lucasp cs stanford edu
