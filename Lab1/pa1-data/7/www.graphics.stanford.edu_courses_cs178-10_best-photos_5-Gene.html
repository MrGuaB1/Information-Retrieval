assignment 5 still life assignment 5 still life gene gene tseng requirements 1 2 and 3 relevant camera settings exposure 12 shots varying from 1 400 sec to 10.0 sec shot with a tripod photoshop work merge to hdr pro background i chose to have a dark background to contrast from the light spots the candles and the caustics lighting this scene is lit purely by just the candles i wanted to create a romantic typed look as that is what i first thought of when i thought about shooting a wine glass positioning of the candles was critical to create a visible caustic that was still within the frame other thoughts at first before i added the menu to the scene the caustic was barely visible because the table was too dark i added the menu on white paper so to bring out the caustic which worked really well another issue was the relative brightness of the candles with the rest of the scene it was too much so i decided shoot at multiple exposures and merge them as one hdr image previous back to all photos next
