ksl 94 47 knowledge engineering for large belief networks reference pradhan m provan g middleton b & henrion m knowledge engineering for large belief networks knowledge systems laboratory medical computer science june 1994 abstract we present several techniques for knowledge engineering of large belief networks bns based on the our experiences with a network derived from a large medical knowledge base the noisy max a generalization of the noisy or gate is used to model causal independence in a bn with multi valued variables we describe the use of leak probabilities to enforce the closed world assumption in our model we present netview a visualization tool based on causal independence and the use of leak probabilities the netview software allows knowledge engineers to dynamically view subnetworks for knowledge engineering and it provides version control for editing a bn netvew generates subnetworks in which leak probabilities are dynamically updated to reflect the missing portions of the network full paper available as ps jump to ksl smi reports by author reports by ksl number reports by year send mail to ksl info ksl stanford edu to send a message to the maintainer of the ksl reports
