cs 348b spring 2004 rendering competition cs 348b spring 2004 rendering competition the renderings below were created for the rendering competition in cs 348b image synthesis techniques taught by pat hanrahan in the spring quarter of 2003 ren ng was the ta for the class the judges for the competition were arnauld lamorlette from pdi dreamworks jim arvo from the university of california at irvine hendrik lensch from the stanford graphics lab the competition was held on june 7th 2004 grand prize jellyfish by kayvon fatahalian and tim foley kayvon and tim modeled the jellyfish body and motion with splines developed a shading model for the jellyfish surface that approximates subsurface scattering and rendered the water with volumetric photon mapping more info first prize reverse pool caustics by toru kuzuhara and kjell reutersward toru and kjell traced light from within a pool of water to the surrounding world to produce very dramatic lighting effects they used a fourier space method to produce the water surface as well as photon mapping and irradiance caching to calculate the lighting on the walls the judges said carpool more info honorable mentions ray visualization by jeremy sugerman jeremy implemented volumetric photon mapping to visualize the passage of rays through lenses the judges said glowing presentation more info rendering lights through fog by barb sweet barb presented a recently developed algorithm for rendering light sources seen through a homogeneous scattering medium in this case fog the judges said a daring flight more info gummy bears by kirk shimano and mike sego kirk and mike implemented volumetric scattering with a photon map to render these convincing images of gummy bears the judges said yummy more info lost at sea by dmitry belogolovsky and woodley packard dmitry and woodley modeled the surface of oceanic water and the branches of a lighting strike combined with a volumetric simulation of light transport for an appropriate glowing effect around the light sources the judges said striking more info raytrix by daniel horn daniel simulated an optical computer in which mirrors and apertures are used to control the flow of light as units of computer the judges said great reflection on computing more info fire animation by andy selle andy modeled the blue core and blackbody radiation of a flame to produce some very realistic fire animations the judges said brilliant more info sashimi by crystal chen and peter lai crystal and peter rendered raw fish with a translucent material model and an explicit modeling of the veining structure of the fish the judges said delicious more info candle by michael green and paul echevarria michael and paul modeled a candle flame as a blackbody emitter and the candle stick as a translucent material the judges said hot acquisition more info underwater scene by chris hong and garrett smith chris and garrett used volumetric photon mapping to render caustic lighting effects streaking through a murky underwater scene the judges said divers paradise more info other amazing submissions relativistic effects by fred akalin fred incorporated special relativity in the tracing of rays to simulate distortions of space that appear at speeds approaching that of light more info human eye by eilene hao and cynthia lau eilene and cynthia modeled the detailed geometry and texture of a human eye and rendered the skin with subsurface scattering effects more info fractal interpolation surfaces by chand thomas john chand developed a rendering algorithm for tensor product fractal interpolation surfaces more info genie exiting a lamp by kanishka shrivastava and ramesh balakrishnan kanishka and ramesh implemented a number of rendering effects to produce an image of genie and an oil lamp their techniques include subsurface scattering optimized photon mapping perlin noise textures and modeling the oil as a homogeneous participating medium more info antelope canyon by mathieu bredif and clovis schaff mathieu and clovis modeled the walls of a sandstone canyon with constructive solid geometry primitives the phase function for the dust cloud is modeled with a perlin noise function and rendered with highly optimized volumetric photon mapping more info lighthouse in fog by jason anderson and david myszewski jason and david modeled fog with a perlin noise turbulence function a lighthouse beam as a parameterized light and rendered their scene efficiently with an optimized volume integrator more info oil and moisture on human skin by sameh kamel sameh rendered the appearance of human skin by simulating translucency where light penetrates the surface and departs at a slightly different location and the total internal reflection that occurs in wet materials more info underwater scene by kevin coletta alex williams and jed crosby kevin alex and jed modeled an underwater world and rendered the caustic light effects with a controllable parameterized photon shooting procedure more info more info
