action items from the discussion long range pep ii upgrades and a super b factory sbf page 1 j seeman february 1 2002 action items from the discussion on long range pep ii upgrades and a super b factory sbf a design of a superconducting ir for the super b factory sbf could be useful for a 4x1 034 cm2 s upgrade to pep ii 2 the best time for a 4 10 crn s upgrade to pep ii may well be the summer of fy2005 when the svt will likely be upgraded 3 a design of a superconducting ir for the super b factory sbf would not have a support tube and will likely need a magic vacuum flange and separate detector support for the svt and be chamber 4 a careful analysis of the background in belle kekb should be done to determine how much better its ir design is than with head on collisions is it really a factor of ten better 5 a lattice of 90 degrees phase advance per cell or higher should be studied for the pep ii her to see if the momentum compaction is sufficiently small to reduce the bunch length for future low vertical betas 6 for the fy2005 ir upgrade a finite crossing angle and additional w shielding should be considered along with the svt fixes 7 if the q2 chamber upgrade for the fall of fy2002 does not help enough with the be chamber temperature then opening the support tube for extra cooling in fy2003 should be considered 972
