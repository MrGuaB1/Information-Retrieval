guidelines for shelving books page 1 sulair preservation guidelines for shelving bound materials use of bookends most book bindings are particularly vulnerable in two areas at the joint or the grooved area where the cover boards are attached to the text block and at the hinge or the point inside the book where the spine cover and text block meet joint hinge when a book leans to one side the weight of the text block exerts pressure on the joints and hinges 1 modified april 21 2009 page 2 sulair preservation as this photograph illustrates leaning may cause the text block to separate from the book cover the joint may also break causing the cover board to detach when used properly bookends prevent damage by supporting the text block and relieving pressure on the hinges and joints of a book while books should fit securely on the shelf it is also important not to shelve books so tightly that force is required to remove them as this can also cause damage allow for a few inches of free space on each shelf in general a good rule of thumb is to shelve books in a way that makes them easy to remove 2 modified april 21 2009 page 3 sulair preservation spine up vs spine down shelving when a book is shelved spine up the weight of the paper causes the text block to pull away from the cover of the book eventually gravity may cause the hinge to loosen and the text block to separate from the cover 3 modified april 21 2009 page 4 sulair preservation if books are too tall to be shelved upright but cannot be stored flat shelve them with the spine facing down this prevents damage to the joints and hinges of a book 4 modified april 21 2009
