ksl software and network services swsl the semantic web services language swsl is used to specify formal characterizations of web service concepts and descriptions of individual services more specifically swsl is a general purpose logical language with certain features to make it usable with the basic languages and infrastructure of the web these features include uris integration of xml built in types and xml compatible namespace and import mechanisms contacts deborah l mcguinness sheila mcilraith owl s owl s supplies web service providers with a core set of markup language constructs for describing the properties and capabilities of their web services in unambiguous computer intepretable form owl s markup of web services will facilitate the automation of web service tasks including automated web service discovery execution interoperation composition and execution monitoring following the layered approach to markup language development the current version of owl s builds on top of owl contacts deborah l mcguinness sheila mcilraith tap the tap project is building a semantic web of data by providing query interfaces publishing models semantic negotiation techniques and a large amount of software for publishing and querying the machine readble web special emphasis is placed on utilization of existing internet data sources and on defining the minimal constraints that must be placed upon the data to ensure many to many connectivity and interoperability inference web inference web is a framework for explaining semantic web reasoning tasks by storing exchanging abstracting combining annotating comparing and rendering proofs and proof fragments provided by reasoners embedded in semantic web applications and facilities jtp theorem prover jtp is a java implementation of a model elimination theorem prover for full first order logic as well as context logic this is a small but fairly efficient theorem prover based on stickel's pttp prolog technology theorem prover method it is easy to extend and easy to embed in a larger application ontolingua server provides a distributed collaborative environment to browse create edit modify and use ontologies the server supports over 150 active users some of whom have provided us with descriptions of their projects chimaera chimaera helps you reorganize the taxonomy and resolve name conflicts in a kb especially useful when merging kbs but also useful as an ontology browser and ontological sketchpad open knowledge base connectivity okbc okbc is an api and reference implementation that allows representation system platform and language independent knowledge level communication okbc was developed jointly by the ksl and the ai center at sri int to allow knowledge application authors to write representation system independent tools and to allow knowledge authors to publish their knowledge home people software and network services projects contact technical reports links copyright 2005 stanford university all rights reserved last modified monday 26 jul 2010 12 16 15 pdt
