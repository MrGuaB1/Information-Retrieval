using and porting gnu cc gnu cc and portability go to the previous next section gnu cc and portability the main goal of gnu cc was to make a good fast compiler for machines in the class that the gnu system aims to run on 32 bit machines that address 8 bit bytes and have several general registers elegance theoretical power and simplicity are only secondary gnu cc gets most of the information about the target machine from a machine description which gives an algebraic formula for each of the machine's instructions this is a very clean way to describe the target but when the compiler needs information that is difficult to express in this fashion i have not hesitated to define an ad hoc parameter to the machine description the purpose of portability is to reduce the total work needed on the compiler it was not of interest for its own sake gnu cc does not contain machine dependent code but it does contain code that depends on machine parameters such as endianness whether the most significant byte has the highest or lowest address of the bytes in a word and the availability of autoincrement addressing in the rtl generation pass it is often necessary to have multiple strategies for generating code for a particular kind of syntax tree strategies that are usable for different combinations of parameters often i have not tried to address all possible cases but only the common ones or only the ones that i have encountered as a result a new target may require additional strategies you will know if this happens because the compiler will call abort fortunately the new strategies can be added in a machine independent fashion and will affect only the target machines that need them go to the previous next section
