assignment 1 bad photos assignment 1 bad photos daniel daniel chia requirement 1 at least one photo must be poorly exposed that is most of the image should be either very close to black underexposed or close to flat white to due oversaturation overexposed ordinarily i would not let the highlight's on the subject's face blow out like that however in this case i wanted to create a dreamy feeling using shallow depth of feel and having everything close to white i adjusted the tone curve in lightroom to bring up the midtones to help create the dreamy high key look previous back to all photos next
