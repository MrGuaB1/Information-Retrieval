is hedonic experience relative or absolute page 1 is hedonic experience relative or absolute abstract many have argued that the relationship between external events and happiness hedonic experience is relative others claim it is absolute to explore this issue we distinguish three types of happiness the happiness derived from money monetary experience from acquiring an item acquisition experience and from consuming an item consumption experience using both laboratory and field data we show that monetary and acquisition experience is relative but consumption experience can be absolute we further distinguish consumption as being inherently evaluable such as the temperature of bathwater or inherently inevaluable such as the size of a diamond and find that inherently evaluable consumption experience is absolute while inherently inevaluable consumption experience is relative these findings yield both theoretical implications for whether preferences are inherent or constructed and social implications for how to increase consumer wellbeing across generations
