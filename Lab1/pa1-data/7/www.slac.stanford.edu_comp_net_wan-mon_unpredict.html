ping unpredictability ping unpredictability this is an extension of the ping predictability metric developed by hans werner braun of nlanr we define ping success 1 100 data byte ping packets lost total number of 100 data byte ping packets ping data rate 2000 bytes average response time of 10 consecutive 1000 data byte ping packets then for a set of pings eg all the pings to a given host in one day we calculate s average ping success max ping success and r average ping data rate max ping data rate then we define ping unpredictability u as the distance of the coordinate s r from 1 1 or u sqrt 1 r 2 1 s 2 finally in order to normalize the distance u to a maximum of 1 we derive the normalized unpredictability u u sqrt 2 0 u 1 as an example the ping data for rutherford appleton laboratory ral for january 30 1997 see below for the response time and packet loss data yields success data rate kb s max 100 10.15 avg 91 4.75 ratios s r 0.91 0.47 and this yields u 0.54 u 38.1 the offsite unpredictability table shows the normalized unpredictability u for sites seen from slac starting in jan 95 a histogram of the average monthly percent unpredictability for about 65 remote sites that slac monitors for the period jan 95 through mar 97 is shown below one can also group hosts with some affinity together and average the unpredicatbility for those hosts for some period this enables us to get an overall indicator of performance for the group of hosts an example where we have averaged the ping responses for all the esnet hosts western n american hosts eastern n american hosts and international hosts is seen below les cottrell
