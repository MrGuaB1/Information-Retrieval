the design of a parallel graphics interface the design of a parallel graphics interface homan igehy gordon stoll and pat hanrahan stanford university appears in computer graphics siggraph 98 proceedings abstract it has become increasingly difficult to drive a modern high performance graphics accelerator at full speed with a serial immediate mode graphics interface to resolve this problem retained mode constructs have been integrated into graphics interfaces while retained mode constructs provide a good solution in many cases at times they provide an undesirable interface model for the application programmer and in some cases they do not solve the performance problem in order to resolve some of these cases we present a parallel graphics interface that may be used in conjunction with the existing api as a new paradigm for high performance graphics applications the parallel api extends existing ideas found in opengl and x11 that allow multiple graphics contexts to simultaneously draw into the same image through the introduction of synchronization primitives the parallel api allows parallel traversal of an explicitly ordered scene we give code examples which demonstrate how the api can be used to expose parallelism while retaining many of the desirable features of serial immediate mode programming the viability of the api is demonstrated by the performance of our implementation which achieves scalable performance on a 24 processor system paper acrobat pdf format 107 kb postscript format 388 kb copyright notice from acm permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page copyrights for components of this work owned by others than acm must be honored abstracting with credit is permitted to copy otherwise to republish to post on servers or to redistribute to lists requires prior specific permission and or a fee homan graphics stanford edu
