prefetching in a texture cache architecture prefetching in a texture cache architecture homan igehy matthew eldridge and kekoa proudfoot stanford university appears in the proceedings of the 1998 eurographics siggraph workshop on graphics hardware abstract texture mapping has become so ubiquitous in real time graphics hardware that many systems are able to perform filtered texturing without any penalty in fill rate the computation rates available in hardware have been outpacing the memory access rates and texture systems are becoming constrained by memory bandwidth and latency caching in conjunction with prefetching can be used to alleviate this problem in this paper we introduce a prefetching texture cache architecture designed to take advantage of the access characteristics of texture mapping the structures needed are relatively simple and are amenable to high clock rates to quantify the robustness of our architecture we identify a set of six scenes whose texture locality varies over nearly two orders of magnitude and a set of four memory systems with varying bandwidths and latencies through the use of a cycle accurate simulation we demonstrate that even in the presence of a high latency memory system our architecture can attain at least 97 of the performance of a zero latency memory system talk online slides paper acrobat pdf 72 dpi jpeg images 187 kb acrobat pdf jpeg images format 1.1 mb acrobat pdf uncompressed images 11.7 mb copyright notice from acm permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page copyrights for components of this work owned by others than acm must be honored abstracting with credit is permitted to copy otherwise to republish to post on servers or to redistribute to lists requires prior specific permission and or a fee homan graphics stanford edu
