the next linear collider program news the next linear collider in the press the secretary of energy has released a much anticipated 20 year plan for construction of major research facilities across the fields managed by the doe office of science it is exciting that construction of the international linear collider is a high priority goal of this plan http www sc doe gov sub facilities_for_future 20 year outlook screen pdf the doe office of science director ray orbach has spent much of his first year in office creating this prioritized list of 28 projects needed over the next 20 years to pursue the missions of the doe it has been a far reaching exercise and many of the proposals put forward in the process did not make the final cut the plan includes projects already under way such as the lcls mid term projects in conceputal stages the linear collider is the highest priority project in this category and long range projects still in early proof of principle r&d while this plan is not a proposal for funding it is significant that the secretary who speaks to the president has taken ownership and brought forward this roadmap to the future the international scientific community is moving rapidly to make a clear choice for the linear collider accelerator technology begin to work on a common machine and present a coherent plan for the collider project to the various governments with our collaborators we are ready to demonstrate that the x band technology is the key to exploring the energy frontier it will be an exciting year november 2003 nlcta 8 pack news on april 1 the nlcta 8 pack was connected to 4 structures in the nlcta accelerator enclosure this challenging and complex task was completed on schedule we are now commissioning llrf diagnostics and controls preliminary processing has gone well and we have gradients approaching 60mv m in each of these structures with a 400 ns pulse the up to the minute snapshot of our rf processing status including the old line type modulators is available m ross collision course with reality why physicists long for the straight and narrow one collider many countries how to share the wealth the executive summary of the technical review committee report trc http www slac stanford edu xorg ilc trc 2002 2002 report 03rep htm acfa rolls out its roadmap for an international linear collider the jlc project report roadmap was released to the world wide hep community about 400 participants including representatives from industry and the news media attended the acfa linear collider symposium held on february 12 2003 in tsukuba presentations text only slac meeting schedule nlc home nlc technical program office nlc collaboration conventional facilities electrical systems mechanical systems accelerator physics injector systems main linac systems beam delivery systems other options test facilities special projects navbar documentation nlc playpen web comments & suggestions desktop trouble call lc group at fnal this page was updated on april 22 2004 by nixx
