assignment 3 macro photography assignment 3 macro photography alice alice che this fulfills both requirement 1 and 5 focus on the foreground and man made objects back in high school i made 1000 cranes and recently went looking for them because i wanted to hang them up i found that i lost most of them so i m slowly starting to make the rest of them i had a lot of trouble finding the right composition for these this like all of the pictures for this assignment was taken with the tamron 90mm macro that i borrowed from tatiana i used a tripod for this shot so i could stop down the aperture without raising the iso too much matrix metering didn t work too well so i actually blew this shot i had to lower both the exposure and vibrance in acr to pull back some detail other than that i sharpened and played with curves and levels a bit previous back to all photos next
