transcriptional regulation & function in the human cell cycle home primary data clustering functional analysis celera cellular role database celera cellular role database this database is a hand curated hierarchical database of the cellular functions of genes this database has been greatly expanded and is now called the panther classification system and is available to celera customers this database includes many genes not on the affymetrix hu6800 chip but this website only refers to those that were of late 1999 a public version can also be found at http panther celera com dots_desc_numbers_forng contains the names of all categories and the number of h6800 genes in each category for those cellular roles that were correlated with the cell cycle clusters fig 2 we list all genes that have been classified as having that cellular role in cellular_functions_paper g1_dna_replication lists all genes regulated in g1 that are involved in dna replication g2_apoptosis lists all genes regulated in g2 that are involved in apoptosis g2_cytosk_reorg lists all genes regulated in g2 that are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization g2_mitosis_cc_control lists all genes regulated in g2 that are involved in mitosis and cell cycle control g2_muscular_contract lists all genes regulated in g2 that are involved in acto myosin contraction m_cell_adhesion lists all genes regulated in m that are involved in cell to cell adhesion m_chromosome_seg lists all genes regulated in m that are involved in chromosome segregation m_mitosis_cc_control lists all genes regulated in m that are involved in mitosis and cell cycle control binomial information in comparing celera db to genes regulated during g1 g2 m s for an explanation of these four files see second page of functional analysis those interested in learning more about the commercial plans for this database can contact michael campbell at michael campbell fc celera com webmaster
