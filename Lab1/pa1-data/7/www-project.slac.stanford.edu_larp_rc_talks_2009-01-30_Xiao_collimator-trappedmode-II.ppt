slide 1 trapped modes in lhc collimator ii liling xiao advanced computations department slac national accelerator laboratory using frequency domain code omega3p to search for the trapped modes below 2ghz and provide hom parameters for beam heating and coupled bunch stability studies beam frequency spectrum  7.6 cm 900mhz collimator beam pipe r 42mm fc te11 2.1 ghz fc tm01 2.73 ghz simulation model for lhc collimator 14 model for omega3p runs rectangular vacuum tank round vacuum tank 14 model for omega3p runs y x z longitudinal trapped modes with magnetic boundary conditions on x and y symmetric planes modes with ez component on z axis are determined a quarter structure when the beam crosses the collimator these modes will be excited that result in beam energy loss and collimator power dissipation beam heating due to these trapped modes will vary depending on the opening of the two jaws when the two jaws are fully opened with gap 42mm the beam heating is getting the largest so we only calculated the trapped modes when the two jaws are fully opened h h ez h ez h form factor not included loss factors gap 42mm lower longitudinal trapped modes rectangular tank f 82mhz f 334mhz f 196mhz f 481mhz f 630mhz f 779mhz f 936mhz b field e field lower longitudinal trapped modes 92.8 mhz 206mhz 337mhz 477mhz 621mhz 767mhz 912mhz b field e field round tank power dissipation vacuum tank is made of stainless steel sigma 0.116 e7s m two jaws are made of copper sigma 5.8 e7s m for gap 42mm with rectrangular tank p dissipation 15 w for gap 42mm with round tank p dissipation 515 w in round tank modes spread around the tank and have higher q in rectangular tank modes localize between the jaw and the chamber wall and have lower q shunt impedance r 10kohm how to reduce the q 1 change the geometry 2 put the lossy material along the jaws what is the acceptable number for the power dissipation on the wall transverse trapped modes with magnetic boundary condition on y plane and electric boundary on x plane modes with strong ey component between the two jaws are determined when beam crosses the collimator these modes will be excited and generate transverse kick in the y direction as well as beam energy loss due to the small gap of the jaws the ey component is very strong over the full length of the collimator especially when the two jaws are fully inserted with gap 2mm so we only calculated trapped modes when the two jaws are closed h e h e ey ey a quarter structure kick factors of trapped modes form factor not included loss factors of trapped modes rectangular tank round tank form factor not included loss factors of transverse modes depend on the beam offset power dissipation these modes can also cause beam energy loss that strongly depends on the beam offset round vacuum tank rectangular vacuum tank 2.7 w 6w 11w transverse modes 2ghz gap 2mm 15w longitudinal modes 2ghz gap 42mm 515w longitudinal modes 2ghz gap 42mm 6.7 w 15.2 w 26.6 w transverse modes 2ghz gap 2mm 0.050 mm max offset 0.075 mm 0.100 mm beam offset y0 p dissipation wall
