task name ps2 beam instability r&d task name ps2 beam instability r&d ps2 will be a high current synchrotron with circulating beam current up to 2.5 a and peak current of 12 25 a depending on the bunching factor preliminary estimates suggest that an impedance reduction of a factor 2 or better compared to the present ps vacuum system is required to maintain beam stability this is not a trivial improvement we propose a study of this issue including the following steps perform a first estimate of single bunch instabilities in the ps2 reference design parametrize against vacuum chamber properties this includes vacuum chamber impedance estimates based on first guesses at the vacuum chamber properties dimensions and material build an impedance model of the ps2 vacuum system using the best available guesses for the vacuum system and the best available data for the rf cavities based eg on the fnal booster cavity unless a better model is available estimate single bunch growth rates and characteristics of instabilities for these conditions the frequency spectrum of the rf system impedance is unknown at this time however guesses at transverse and longitudinal modes may be made based on the fnal booster cavity analyze llrf feedback topologies for the fundamental cavities investigate noise sources and mitigation a 2 nd harmonic rf system is envisaged for ps2 the impedance spectrum of which is also necessary to include in the estimates once an impedance model has been created simulations and or analytic estimates will be used to estimate the instability growth rates for both single bunch instabilities and coupled bunch instabilities depending on the impedance model issues like self bunching of the beam at higher frequency shall be studied this task will naturally lead towards design aspects of the vacuum system impedance questions have to be balanced against eddy currents created during ramping of the ps2 hom damping may not be required due to the long bunches but this should be checked impedance spectra of components with varying apertures bellows etc will be evaluated likewise we will collaborate with the designers of the rf system esp the cavities deliverable report white paper participants in this proposal slac k bane g stupakov c rivetta c ng fnal v lebedev tbc lbnl j byrd s de santis m furman effort 1 fte fy09 2 fte fy10 travel 2 person weeks fy09 3 person weeks fy10
