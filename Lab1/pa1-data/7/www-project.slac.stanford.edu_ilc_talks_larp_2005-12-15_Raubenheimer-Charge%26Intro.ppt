no slide title ilc the international linear collider tor raubenheimer larp phase ii collimator design review introduction slac december 15 th 2005 welcome slac thru larp is working on metal collimators for the lhc metallic collimators are likely needed to reach design luminosity beam damage is also possible due to abort kickers misfires consumable concept is outgrowth of nlc linear collider r&d metal collimators absorb 12 kw dc and 60 kw in transients cooling and distortions are problematic rotation to deal with multiple damage events present design is thought ready for prototyping need review of basic concept engineering implementation and planned prototyping for us and for larp management expensive prototyping but needed for confidence in design need to start construction soon to meet lhc schedule 2008 2009 charge 1 three points maturity of the design is it ready for prototyping has the collimator system been studied sufficiently ie are metal collimators the correct solution have the material options been considered sufficiently is the rotating concept appropriate to deal with damage scenarios can the concept be expected to meet the thermal and mechanical requirements what are the unforeseen risks and difficulties will the prototype meet its goals what engineering difficulties could limit the prototype charge 2 is the construction plan for the prototype s reasonable and are the proposed tests sufficient to resolve the performance questions are the series of prototypes and experiments sufficient for cern to decide to adopt this technology are the proposed budget schedule and milestones adequate for the project a short verbal summary this afternoon would be appreciated to be followed by a written letter thanks agenda tentative agenda 09 00 09 10 tor raubenheimer welcome & charge to committee 09 10 10 00 tom markiewicz project overview 30 20 10 00 10 30 ralph assmann cern comments on collimation system requirements the rc1 design and prototype plan and cern plans for phase ii collimator design 20 10 10 30 10 50 lew keller energy deposition studies 15 5 10 50 11 10 coffee break 11 10 11 30 yunhai cai collimator efficiency studies 15 5 11 30 12 30 eric doyle prototype engineering studies 30 30 12 30 13 30 working lunch with discussion 13 30 14 00 eric doyle rc1 construction & test plan 15 15 14 00 14 30 all discussion 14 30 15 30 committee assemble report notes 15 30 16 00 committee closeout 16 00 adjourn
