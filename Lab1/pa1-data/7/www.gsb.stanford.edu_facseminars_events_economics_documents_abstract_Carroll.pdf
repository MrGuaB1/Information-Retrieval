title a quantitative approach to incentives application to voting rules page 1 title a quantitative approach to incentives application to voting rules abstract we present a general approach to quantifying a mechanism's susceptibility to strategic manipulation based on the premise that agents report their preferences truthfully if there is little to gain from behaving strategically susceptibility is defined as the maximum amount of expected utility an agent can gain by manipulating we apply this measure to anonymous voting rules by making minimal restrictions on voters utility functions and beliefs about each other's behavior we give two sets of results first we offer bounds on the susceptibility of specific voting rules this includes considering several voting systems which have been previously advanced as resistant to manipulation we find that they are actually more susceptible than simple plurality rule by our measure second we give asymptotic lower bounds on susceptibility for any voting rule under various combinations of efficiency regularity and informational conditions these results illustrate the tradeoffs between susceptibility and other properties of the voting rule
