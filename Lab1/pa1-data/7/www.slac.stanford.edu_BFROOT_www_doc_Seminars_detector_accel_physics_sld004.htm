ppt slide slide 4 of 33 first previous next last index home text once the electrons are generated using the electron gun they are accelerated using micro wave energy created by the klystron this is a picture of a klystron it is the stack of cylinders one red and one silver shown next to the man in this picture each of the 240 klystrons spaced evenly at 10 meter intervals along the entire linac can generate a peak power of 67 gigawatts for about 3.5 microseconds the next three slides show how this power is generated and how it is used to accelerated electrons and positrons simultaneously every 1 120th of a second first previous next last index home text
