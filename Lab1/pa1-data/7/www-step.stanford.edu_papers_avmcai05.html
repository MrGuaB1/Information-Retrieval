bradley manna sipma termination of polynomial programs termination of polynomial programs aaron r bradley zohar manna henny b sipma we present a technique to prove termination of multipath polynomial programs an expressive class of loops that enables practical code abstraction and analysis the technique is based on finite differences of expressions over transition systems although no complete method exists for determining termination for this class of loops we show that our technique is useful in practice we demonstrate that our prototype implementation for c source code readily scales to large software projects proving termination for a high percentage of targeted loops in proc of verification model checking and abstract interpretation vmcai 05 lncs 3385 springer verlag 2005 bibtex postscript pdf 2005 springer verlag henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu last modified april 7 14 40 50 pdt 2005
