libc info mallinfo libc info mallinfo go forward to __malloc_lock go backward to malloc go up to stdlib go to the top op libc mallinfo malloc_stats mallopt malloc support synopsis include malloc h struct mallinfo mallinfo void void malloc_stats void int mallopt int parameter value struct mallinfo _mallinfo_r void reent void _malloc_stats_r void reent int _mallopt_r void reent int parameter value description mallinfo returns a structure describing the current state of memory allocation the structure is defined in malloc h the following fields are defined arena is the total amount of space in the heap ordblks is the number of chunks which are not in use uordblks is the total amount of space allocated by malloc fordblks is the total amount of space not in use keepcost is the size of the top most memory block malloc_stats print some statistics about memory allocation on standard error mallopt takes a parameter and a value the parameters are defined in malloc h and may be one of the following m_trim_threshold sets the maximum amount of unused space in the top most block before releasing it back to the system in free the space is released by calling _sbrk_r with a negative argument m_top_pad is the amount of padding to allocate whenever _sbrk_r is called to allocate more space the alternate functions _mallinfo_r _malloc_stats_r and _mallopt_r are reentrant versions the extra argument reent is a pointer to a reentrancy structure returns mallinfo returns a mallinfo structure the structure is defined in malloc h malloc_stats does not return a result mallopt returns zero if the parameter could not be set or non zero if it could be set portability mallinfo and mallopt are provided by svr4 but mallopt takes different parameters on different systems malloc_stats is not portable created mon nov 8 17 42 53 2004 on tillpc with info_to_html version 0.9 6
