sankaranarayanan sipma manna petri net analysis using invariant generation petri net analysis using invariant generation sriram sankaranarayanan henny sipma zohar manna petri nets have been widely used to model and analyze concurrent systems their wide spread use in this domain is on one hand facilitated by their simplicity and expressiveness on the other hand the analysis of petri nets for questions like reachability boundedness and deadlock freedom can be surprisingly hard in this paper we model petri nets as transition systems we exploit the special structure in these transition systems to provide an exact and closed form characterization of all its inductive linear invariants we then exploit this characterization to provide an invariant generation technique that we demonstrate to be efficient and powerful in practice we compare our work with those in the literature and discuss extensions in verification theory and practice lncs 2772 springer verlag 2003 postscript pdf 2003 springer verlag henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu last modified thu jan 12 14 40 50 pdt 2004
