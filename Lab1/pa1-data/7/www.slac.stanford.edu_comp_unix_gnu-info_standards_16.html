gnu coding standards library behavior go to the previous next section library behavior try to make library functions reentrant if they need to do dynamic storage allocation at least try to avoid any nonreentrancy aside from that of malloc itself here are certain name conventions for libraries to avoid name conflicts choose a name prefix for the library more than two characters long all external function and variable names should start with this prefix in addition there should only be one of these in any given library member this usually means putting each one in a separate source file an exception can be made when two external symbols are always used together so that no reasonable program could use one without the other then they can both go in the same file external symbols that are not documented entry points for the user should have names beginning with _ they should also contain the chosen name prefix for the library to prevent collisions with other libraries these can go in the same files with user entry points if you like static functions and variables can be used as you like and need not fit any naming convention go to the previous next section
