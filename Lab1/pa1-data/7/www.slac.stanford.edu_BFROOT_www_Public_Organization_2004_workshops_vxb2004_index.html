vub sf workshop 2004 using inclusive semileptonic and radiative b decays to explore hqe and sf relations and extract v ub slac friday december 10 and saturday december 11 2004 purpose there have been a series 2001 2002 2003 of workshops hosted by babar in the area of semileptonic and radiative b decays these workshops have proved to be a valuable venue for the exchange of ideas between the theoretical and experimental communities we fully expect this trend to continue in this year's workshop this workshop will focus on inclusive semileptonic decays the b sg spectrum and the related theoretical tools namely the hqe and shape function the intent is to have an informal meeting focusing on physics issues primarily the interpretation of current and future measurements of inclusive semileptonic and radiative decays and associated theoretical uncertainties talks will be posted to the babar internal web while theoretical talks will be publicly available the experimental talks with not yet preliminary results will be restricted to babar members only program the workshop is scheduled for december 10 11 2004 and will start on friday afternoon there will be a small number of overview talks on the relevant experimental and theoretical areas and ample time for discussion the agenda with links to the presentations is available registration there is a $15 registration fee to be paid by cash at the workshop to cover lunch and breaks this workshop is intended primarily for members of the semileptonic and radiative penguin analysis working groups and for theorists working on closely related topics please go to register to register for this workshop to see who is already registered click here other information when december 10 11 2004 beginning 2pm on the 10th ending 4pm on the 11th where slac redwood room c d rob contacts bob kowalewski masahiro morii accomodations slac guest house or hotels near slac from the slac page meals we will provide refreshments during the breaks and a continental breakfast and a light lunch on saturday a no host dinner will be arranged for friday evening contributions in order to link contributions to the agenda and make them available on the web participants are asked to provide a pdf or ps file on the evening before the session by either sending a url for the file to one of the organizers sending the file via e mail attachment to one of the organizers or copying the file on a usb memory stick and hand it to one of the organizers invited introductory talks will be presented via computer projection all hand written transparencies will be scanned a reading list of recent papers relevant to this workshop can be found here last modified dec 3 2004 by bob kowalewski
