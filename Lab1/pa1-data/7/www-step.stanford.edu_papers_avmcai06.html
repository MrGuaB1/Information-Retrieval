bradley manna sipma what's decidable about arrays what's decidable about arrays aaron r bradley zohar manna henny b sipma motivated by applications to program verification we study a decision procedure for satisfiability in an expressive fragment of a theory of arrays which is parameterized by the theories of the array elements the decision procedure reduces satisfiability of a formula of the fragment to satisfiability of an equisatisfiable quantifier free formula in the combined theory of equality with uninterpreted functions euf presburger arithmetic and the element theories this fragment allows a constrained use of universal quantification so that one quantifier alternation is allowed with some syntactic restrictions it allows expressing for example that an assertion holds for all elements in a given index range that two arrays are equal in a given range or that an array is sorted we demonstrate its expressiveness through applications to verification of sorting algorithms and parameterized systems we also prove that satisfiability is undecidable for several natural extensions to the fragment finally we describe our implementation in the pvc verification system in proc of verification model checking and abstract interpretation vmcai 06 lncs 3855 springer verlag 2006 pp 427 442 bibtex postscript pdf 2006 springer verlag henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu last modified april 7 14 40 50 pdt 2005
