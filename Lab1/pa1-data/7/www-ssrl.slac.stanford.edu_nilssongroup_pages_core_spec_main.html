core level spectroscopies surface science and x ray spectroscopy group core level spectroscopy creation and decay of core holes spectroscopic techniques introduction core level spectroscopy pro vides a method to study the chemical state local geometric structure nature of chemical bonding and dynamics in electron transfer processes centered around one atomic site via the mechanisms of x ray induced core hole creation and decay t he ejection of a core electron is initiated by the absorption of an x ray photon produced by synchrotron radiation with energy tuned to the electron's ionization as shown here core holes are created by core level ionization and x ray absorption processes the core hole decays by radiant and non radiant processes the resulting excitations and relaxations form the basis for the various core level x ray spectroscopies how an example please how is the ejection of a photoelectron related to the different spectroscopic techniques font the different spectroscopic techn iques can be separated into two classes corresponding to the creation and decay of core holes the cr eation of core holes forms the basis for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray absorption spectroscopy xas the subsequent core hole decay is studied in auger electron spectroscopy aes x ray emission spectroscopy xes how can we use these techniques to gain important information about model systems here's an example to the right is an illustration of the local probing character of core level spectroscopies applied to n2 adsorbed on ni 100 the grey area represents the charge density outside the metal surface with a cut into the molecular adsorbate electronic transitions between core and valence ele ctrons are indicated with arrows click here to see the xps xas xes and aes spectra for this system back to top
