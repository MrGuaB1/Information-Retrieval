assignment 1 bad photos assignment 1 bad photos tatiana tatiana iskandar requirement 3 taken behind toyon i did not want anything to be in focus so i set the focal point between two flowers the first is too blurry to see i used an aperture of f 5.0 with a shutter speed of 1 400 i needed a fast shutter speed because i did not want a lot of light and since it was windy out the flowers were moving a lot i wanted to make a very soft and dream like image so i decreased the contrast and made the photo a bit brighter in photoshop i like how the blur makes the flowers very soft looking by meeting reqirement 3 i was able to make this very simple and dreamy image previous back to all photos next
