assignment 2 sports & action assignment 2 sports & action jennifer jennifer wang serve requirement 4 burst to shoot this i set the camera on burst mode such that each image would receive a 1 3200 sec exposure time and capture a slice of the action it was a really sunny day which helped the exposure but the aperture was still set at f 5.6 to help compensate for the fast shutter speed in five shots the serve is captured from the initial ball toss up to the player's ready to return stance excuse my tennis language i do not play to produce the time lapse image i set the last shot as the background so that final figure would appear the darkest and layered the previous images on top with lower opacity levels 40 50 because multiple layers of the green tennis court would overlap with and dilute the previous images of the player i deleted the green stuff before adding each frame as a new layer image was flattened and cropped and brightness increased previous back to all photos next
