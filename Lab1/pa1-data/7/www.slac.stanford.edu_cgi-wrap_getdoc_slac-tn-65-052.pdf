coil no 70060 16 page 1 tn 65 52 june 1965 w struver relay coil transient tests the control systems of the slac accelerator utilize over 3000 telephone type relays for subsystem control and instrumentation these relay systems operate from a 24 volt battery plant located in each sector tests of the control systems have shown a need to suppress the transient produced when a relay coil voltage is removed this note shows the test setup used as well as the results obtained from various transient suppression methods the note does not attempt to describe all the known methods eg back to back zener diodes ionized gas protectors carbon blocks etc iwo methods are recommended however one for a single polarity applied voltage and another for a bipolar source voltage a simple formula is shown which can be used to determine the value of a resistance and a capicitance to critically damp a relay coil in general any transient suppression method will slow down the release time of a relay this is not a factor in the i c systems used to control the accelerator however because these systems are manually operated slow systems but the increase in release time may be troublesome in computer controlled systems all of the following tests were done using an automatic electric 4 form c eqa relay k below with a 300 r coil coil no 70060 16 test setup osc ll oscope l page 2 the following wave shapes were observed when voltage was removed 1 kz coil unsuppressed 0.3 ms t 2 kz coil suppressed 2 page 3 6 3 page 4 if a bipolar voltage is to be supplied to this type of relay the circuit in 2 above is probably the best di this is because dt is much less therefore the magnetically induced voltage in an adjacent loop is less if a unipolar voltage is to be supplied to this type of relay coil the circuit in 6 above is best calculation of r and c in case 2 above for kz above r dc 300 n ls 79 w q 1.5 c 10 pf at 50 v 4
