an axiomatic semantics for rdf rdf schema and daml oil knowledge systems laboratory stanford university abstract an axiomatic semantics for rdf rdf schema and daml oil richard fikes and deborah l mcguinness an axiomatic semantics for rdf rdf schema and daml oil ksl technical report ksl 01 01 2001 updated october 2001 this document provides an axiomatization for the resource description framework rdf rdf schema rdf s and daml oil by specifying a mapping of a set of descriptions in any one of these languages into a logical theory expressed in first order predicate calculus the basic claim of this paper is that the logical theory produced by the mapping specified herein of a set of such descriptions is logically equivalent to the intended meaning of that set of descriptions providing a means of translating rdf rdf s and daml oil descriptions into a first order predicate calculus logical theory not only specifies the intended meaning of the descriptions but also produces a representation of the descriptions from which inferences can automatically be made using traditional automatic theorem provers and problem solvers for example the daml oil axioms enable a reasoner to infer from the two statements class male and class female are disjointwith and john is type male that the statement john is type female is false the mapping into predicate calculus consists of a simple rule for translating rdf statements into first order relational sentences and a set of first order logic axioms that restrict the allowable interpretations of the non logical symbols ie relations functions and constants in each language since rdf schema and daml oil are both vocabularies of non logical symbols added to rdf the translation of rdf statements is sufficient for translating rdf schema and daml oil as well the axioms are written in ansi knowledge interchange format kif which is a proposed ansi standard the full paper is available in word html and text forms in order to support additional operational use of the document we include two additional files one containing all of the kif axioms and kif theorems in the document this replaces the previous axiomatic semantics for daml oil and the previous axiomatic semantics for daml ont which are available from here this update includes only two minor changes we have modified the norepeatslist to be norepeatstuple and updated the norepeatstuple axioms publications of richard fikes selected publications of deborah l mcguinness home people software and network services projects contact technical reports links copyright 2000 stanford university all rights reserved
