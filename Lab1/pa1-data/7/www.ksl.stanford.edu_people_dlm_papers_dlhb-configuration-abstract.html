description logic for configuration knowledge systems laboratory stanford university abstract description logic for configuration description logics are used to solve a wide variety of problems with configuration applications being some of the largest and longest lived there is concrete commercial evidence that shows that description logic based configurators have been successfully fielded for over a decade additionally it appears that configuration applications have a number of characteristics that make them well suited to description logic based solutions this chapter will introduce the problem of configuration describe some requirements of configuration applications that make them candidates for description logic based solutions show examples of these requirements in a configuration example and introduce the largest and longest lived family of description logic based configurators deborah l mcguinness description logic for configuration franz baader deborah mcguinness daniele nardi and peter patel schneider editors the description logic handbook theory implementation and applications cambridge university press 2002 this pre print version of the paper to be published is available in postscript and pdf format the associated contents index bibliography appendix and introduction are also available in preprint pdf form return to selected papers of deborah l mcguinness home people software and network services projects contact technical reports links copyright 2000 stanford university all rights reserved
