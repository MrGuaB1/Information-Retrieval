service predictability service predictability in order to provide a rough indication of internet service predictability we use a ping predictability metric developed by kimberly claffy of nlanr but using our ping measurements we define ping success 1 100 data byte ping packets lost total number of 100 data byte ping packets ping data rate 2000 bytes average response time of 10 consecutive 1000 data byte ping packets then for a set of pings eg all the pings to a given host in one day we calculate s average ping success max ping success and r average ping data rate max ping data rate we scatterplot the daily average max ratio of packet success s versus average max ratio of data rate r for each host the results are shown below for 1996 for esnet nodes international nodes and other north anerica nodes in these scatter plots points towards the top right indicate high predictability it can be seen that service predictability as seen from slac is much higher for esnet than other nodes esnet jan96 feb96 mar96 apr96 may96 jun96 jul96 aug96 sep96 oct96 nov96 dec96 jan97 international jan96 feb96 mar96 apr96 may96 jun96 jul96 aug96 sep96 oct96 nov96 dec96 jan97 isp_local jan96 feb96 mar96 apr96 may96 jun96 jul96 aug96 sep96 oct96 nov96 dec96 jan97 north_america_east jan96 feb96 mar96 apr96 may96 jun96 jul96 aug96 sep96 oct96 nov96 dec96 jan97 north_america_west jan96 feb96 mar96 apr96 may96 jun96 jul96 aug96 sep96 oct96 nov96 dec96 jan97 north america jan96 feb96 mar96 apr96 may96 jun96 jul96 aug96 sep96 oct96 nov96 dec96 jan97 all jan96 feb96 mar96 apr96 may96 jun96 jul96 aug96 sep96 oct96 nov96 dec96 jan97 owner les cottrell and connie logg
