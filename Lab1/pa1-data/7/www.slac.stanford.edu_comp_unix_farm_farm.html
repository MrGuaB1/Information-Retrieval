unix at slac high performance computing at slac slac 21 may 1999 this page contains pointers to various pieces of information about the unix compute farm if you wish to use a significant amount of unix compute farm resources please contact randy melen the high performance computing team leader in scs to discuss the resources you will need your schedule and how your request will be balanced with the request from other researchers he can be contacted at 650 926 2841 or at randy slac stanford edu getting started 2 minute intro to scs unix cpu farm this is a quick start to using the unix cpu compute farm introduction to scs unix cpu farm this is a not yet completed introduction to the compute farm nevertheless it has useful information and more pointers to in depth information schematic of scs unix cpu farm april 1996 this is a schematic diagram of the unix cpu compute farm circa april 1996 advanced compute farm use lsf user's guide this is a guide to all of the available lsf batch features lsf reference guide this is a reference to all of the available lsf batch features lsf programmer's guide this is a reference manual to the programming interface for all of the available lsf batch features lsf parallel user's guide this is a guide to the parallel programming features of lsf batch where to go for assistance the compute farm is the responsibility of the high performance compute team in scs if you have questions about the batch system contact neal adams neal slac stanford edu questions about staging and tape access should be directed to bill weeks wcw slac stanford edu if you re not sure who to ask contact the team leader randy melen randym slac stanford edu further reading newsgroups slac comp computefarm this link is only accessible to slac nodes owner melen
