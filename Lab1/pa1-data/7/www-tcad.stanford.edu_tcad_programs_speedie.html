speedie speedie speedie 2.5 incorporates new physical models such as 1 2 sticking coefficients deposition 2 pecvd 3 sputter etch 4 thick side wall inhibition model through the 2d geometry and grid server forest speedie 3.0 will be able to cope with nonplanar interfaces in multisteps processes such as deposition and etchback speedie 3.0 would also communicate to suprem through forest speedie 3.0 will extract relevent geometry information top profile process it and give it back to forest which maintain all the geometry and grid information for other modules of suprem to move the boundary therefore we thus differentiate the responsibities of speedie to be phyical calculations and forest to be geometry operations see also the cis description of speedie ze kai hsiau hsiau opal stanford edu center for integrated systems stanford university stanford ca 94305 4055
