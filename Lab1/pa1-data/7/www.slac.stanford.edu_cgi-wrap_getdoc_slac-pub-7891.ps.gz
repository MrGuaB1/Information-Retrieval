characterizing transverse beam jitter in the slc linac abstract page 1 slac pub 7891 july 1998 characterizing transverse beam jitter in the slc linac f j decker r pennacchi r stege j turner stanford linear accelerator center stanford university stanford ca 94309 usa abstract transverse pulse to pulse trajectory instability jitter in the linac of the slac linear collider slc can be caused by various sources including mechanical vibration poor power supply regulation and malfunctioning of trajectory feedbacks systems additionally the linac can amplify pulse to pulse centroid motion that originates in the damping ring or the transport line that connects the ring to the linac the purpose of this study is to identify and characterize these sources and to apply corrections and fixes transverse jitter has been reduced in the last year from 0.5 to 0.2 in x and 1 to 0.3 in y measured in units of beam size jitter is estimated using position monitor data from a large sample of successive pulses the fft power spectrum of the data often indicate roughly equal contributions from motion at 59 hz due to the accelerator cooling water pumps 10 hz motion due to mechanical vibration or power supplies and 0.4 hz due to the feedback loops some of the broadband or random pulse to pulse motion can be correlated with the microwave instability in the damping ring in this paper we describe the data analysis and interpretation that can be used to help locate the subsystem component which is causing the instability presented at the sixth european particle accelerator conference stockholm sweden 22 26 june 1998 work supported by the department of energy contract de ac03 76sf00515
