the suprem iv gs deposit command deposit deposit a layer synopsis deposit silicon oxide oxynitr nitride poly photores alumin gaas thickness n divisions n none arsenic antimony boron phosphor beryllium magnesium selenium isilicon tin germanium zinc carbon generic conc n space n file string description this statement provides a primitive deposition capability material is deposited on the exposed surface of the structure and its upper surface becomes the new exposed surface this code is now based on the generalized triangulation package originally written by conor rafferty as a stand alone program tri this tends to be significantly more robust than the grid generation algorithm in earlier versions of suprem iv eg 8912 there have also been several enhancements in the handling of the offset line it is now possible for instance to fill a trench completely silicon oxide oxynitr nitride poly photores alumin gaas the material to be deposited thickness the thickness in microns divisions the number of vertical grid spacings in the layer default 1 none arsenic antimony boron phosphor beryllium magnesium selenium isilicon tin germanium zinc carbon generic the type of doping in the deposited layer conc this floating point parameter specifies the level of the doping in the deposited layer space this floating point parameter represents the average spacing between points along the outside edge of the deposit file this string parameter specifies the name of a file that contains a string that contains the coordinates associated with the deposit surface this file could be generated using a topography simulator such as sample examples deposit oxide thick 0.02 this deposits silicon dioxide 200 angstroms thick on the surface of the silicon bugs only uniform grid in the deposited material occasionally makes grid errors in following the surface the offset profile is not based on any physical model see also the etch statement
