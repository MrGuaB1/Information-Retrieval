how long is the slac gallery page 1 work supported by us department of energy contract de ac02 76sf00515 how long is the slac gallery hans imfeld slac stanford university ca 94025 the slac communications department contacted metrology to inquire about the length of slac's gallery building 002 initially metrology's alignment engineering group aeg proposed to import slac's orthophotos into a cad platform microstation a draftsman could then graphically pick two points at the gallery's extreme and measure the distance between them 3074.8 m this would be a fast method of producing the length of the gallery but could be in error by several meters due to photo rectification the communications department required a more accurate measurement figure 1 slac orthophotos of gallery ends west east survey crews of aeg measured the length of the gallery using two methods an rtk gps survey and a traditional traverse using a total station gps leica system 500 a gps antenna was positioned approximately 15cm above the gallery roof near the four exterior corners of the gallery a global position was measured at each corner and recorded the length of the gallery was then computed by calculating the 3d distance between the two southerly points and between the two northerly points the two distances agreed to within 4cm august 2007 slac pub 12761 page 2 figure 2 gps measurement of gallery east photo courtesy of michael perry page 3 figure 3 gps measurement of gallery west photo courtesy of michael perry table 1 gps measured building corner coordinates wgs84 ellipsoid meters id x y z 3d distance east_s 2703162.507 4291739.382 3854234.621 3073.773 west_s 2705888.547 4290363.988 3853880.955 east_n 2703160.725 4291733.914 3854241.978 3073.734 west_n 2705886.789 4290358.692 3853888.169 the gps length of the gallery is the average length of the observations minus the antenna pole diameter 1 inch 3073.73 m traditional traverse leica 1105 a survey crew set 5 temporary points along the south gallery road a traverse was run through these points at both ends a reflectorless observation was made to the southerly roof corners of the gallery structure the measurements were run twice a coordinate of 0 0100 was assigned to the first point and onboard software computed the summation of each subsequent observation's coordinate prism offsets and atmospheric conditions were corrected by the onboard software page 4 figure 4 total station measurement of gallery east photo courtesy of hans imfeld table 2 traversed building corner coordinates local coordinate meters id easting northing elevation 3d distance west 7.375 15.387 104.529 3073.719 east 1.377 3089.062 89.262 ws 7.339 15.392 104.571 3073.687 es 1.349 3089.035 89.186 the traversed average length of the gallery is 3073.70 m how long is the gallery since the two methods of observation have similar accuracy and in the interest of keeping it simple aeg averaged the two methods and determined that the length of the gallery is 3073.72 m acknowledgements the author thanks everyone in the alignment engineering group who helped with the field planning data collection data processing and editing
