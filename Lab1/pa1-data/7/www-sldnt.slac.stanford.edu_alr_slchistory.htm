new page 1 history of slac's linear collider program for accelerator physics and particle physics 1983 slc construction starts 1987 slc construction completed 1989 start of physics program using the slc markii is the first detector at the slc interaction point april 11 first z decay at slc observed by the markii detector this is the first decay of a z to quarks ever observed april september markii scans z resonance to determine its mass and width september 6 13 europhysics conference on high energy physics madrid markii presents result that number of neutrinos is less than 3.9 at 95 confidence level 1991 sld replaces markii at the slc interaction point sld has first engineering run 1992 slc commissions polarized electron source polarization is 22 may 2 sld observes first z decay from collisions of polarized electrons with unpolarized positrons 1993 polarization of electron beam improves from 22 to 63 by using a strained gaas photocathode 1994 polarization of electron beam improves from 63 to 75 by using a thin 100nm thick active layer of strained gaas as the photocathode 1996 sld installs an improved ccd vertex detector with over 300 million pixels 1998 sld completes datataking on june 5 1999 sld request for further datataking is denied due to lack of available funding 1999 marty breidenbach awarded panofsky prize by the aps for his many contributions to e e physics especially with the sld detector at the stanford linear collider his deep involvement in all aspects of the project led to important advances both in the measurement of electroweak parameters and in accelerator technology
