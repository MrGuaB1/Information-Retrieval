xin yi zhang project abstract xin yi zhang xyz gloworm stanford edu abstract electrostatic discharge esd is one of the most important reliability problems in the ic industry today it is responsible for about one third of the field failures building test structures on silicon is the current design methodology of esd protection circuits for the same structure the performance of the protection circuit is layout dependent to improve the design methodology new simulation models are being developed to analyze the layout of the protection structures progress measurements were taken on amd's five 0.35 um test devices the five devices have two geometrical variations gate length variation and source drain length variation the trends in the experimental data for each variation were observed and can be explained qualitatively due to the difference in avalanche multiplicative factor beta of bjt and substrate resistance which vary depending on the geometry features of the test devices next the compact model coefficients are extracted using the calibration method according to shiang's 97 sispad paper publications & presentations this quarter shiang l lim xin y zhang zhiping yu stephen beebe and robert w dutton a robust quasi empirical compact model for the simulation of mos breakdown in esd protection circuit design int l conf on simulation of semiconductor processes and devices sispad 97 sept 1997 trips xin yi attended the 1997 esd symposium in santa clara from sept 21 5 she also attended the 1997 gfp annual conference in santa clara from sept 28 30
