slac linux faq stanford linear accelerator center slac linux frequently asked questions slac computing unix at slac linux at slac updated 10 may 2006 can i install a more current version of mysql why won t my paw or root window refresh how can i modify my x server options can i install a more current version of mysql red hat ships a version of mysql but some users wish to use a more current version downloaded from the mysql com web site if you do though be sure to install the shared compatibility libraries the mysql shared compat rpm rather than the standard shared libraries mysql shared standard a number of mysql related rpms such as mysql python have dependencies on the older versions of the mysql shared libraries which are not included in mysql shared standard a security update to one of these ancillary rpms can trigger a re installation of red hat's version of the libraries which in turn can end up un installing all or part of mysql shared standard the mysql shared compat rpms includes these older shared libraries and thus satisfies the dependencies preventing this kind of problem why won t my paw or root window refresh backing store is a mechanism that an x server may use to refresh a portion of a window after another window has temporarily obscured it it is intended to improve performance by handling such refreshes locally in the x server without incurring network overhead to talk to the client and possibly significant recalculation in the client to reconstruct the contents of the window however there are mixed opinions as to whether the use of backing store as defined for x servers is likely to improve or degrade performance see for example why doesn t my x server use backing store how can i turn it on clients are not supposed to depend on tha availability of backing store in the x server not only is it supposed to be an optional and configurable feature but some servers might not have sufficient memory to handle all the backing store requests nevertheless some clients do depend on it including paw and root there is no documented way in the current version of xfree86 4.3 to force the x server to use backing store for all windows however there is an undocumented command line option bs that seems to have this effect the documented bs option disables backing store if you need to use an application that's not redrawing its windows after another window obscures them you can try configuring your system to start your x server with the bs command line option see how can i modify my x server options for instructions on specifying command line options for your x server how can i modify my x server options gdm if you are using gdm the gnome display manager the relevant configuration file is etc x11 gdm gdm conf edit this file as root and find the stanza beginning with a line like this server standard find the command line within this stanza and append or modify your options to the command line the gdm daemon only rereads its config file when it first starts or when you send it a hup signal which has the side effect of restarting killing your current gdm session thus it is not sufficient to simply logout and login again to get your x server running with its new options one solution is to simply reboot your machine here's a somewhat less disruptive solution logout from your current gdm session press ctrl alt f2 say to get to one of the command line login screens and login in line mode issue the command ps ef grep gdm and find the process id pid for the primary gdm daemon this is the gdm instance whose parent process has pid 1 issue the command kill hup gdm pid where gdm pid is the process id of the primary gdm daemon after a short wait your x server should restart and you should be presented with a login screen before logging into your gdm session you should first go back to your login screen by pressing ctrl alt f2 and logout before logging out you might was to do ps ef grep x and check that the x server is now running with your options press ctrl alt f7 or possibly ctrl alt f8 to get back to your gdm login screen i have sometimes seen this screen refuse to refresh if that happens try ctrl alt bs to restart the x server yet again kdm if you are using kdm the kde display manager you should first search the file etc kde kdm kdmrc for a line beginning xservers normally this line will point to a file such as usr share config kdm xservers which usually resolves to etc x11 xdm xservers this file will normally contain a single non comment line that looks something like this 0 local usr x11r6 bin x edit this file as root and append or modify your options following the path to the xserver binary to restart your x server logout of your kdm session and login again use the command ps ef grep x to verify that your x server is now running with your desired options len moss
