sgtc cn data release policy data release policy for the c neoformans genome project update as of february 2003 our funding agency the niaid has recently november 18 2002 reiterated the most essential point of our policy for genomic data details should be provided in the plan to assure that sequence data release and usage will support the principal that high quality primary genomic sequencing data should be rapidly and freely released to the broad scientific community without restriction prior to publication and reconcile the interests of the scientific community for early data release and those of the sequencing centers plan must recognize the widely accepted ethic in the scientific community that those who generate the primary genomic data and preliminary genome wide data analysis should have priority to publish the work in a peer reviewed journal in a timely manner emphasis added omb no 0990 0115 please remember that a timely manner includes time for finishing we ask that users of our unpublished sequence data respect our sgtc and tigr intention to publish the complete accurate and annotated sequence of the c neoformans genome along with our large scale interpretation of that genome sequence as soon as finishing and annotation are completed in this context large scale refers to regions the size of the whole genome or individual chromosome arms examples of large scale interpretations include but are not limited to identification of regions of evolutionary conservation across the genome and or individual chromosomes identification of complete sets of genomic features such as genes gene families biochemical and metabolic pathways repeat structures g c content to avoid any possible misunderstanding please email dr richard hyman rhyman stanford edu because there will be serious consequences to any violators of our data release policy see hyman letter to the editor of science with this single exception the pre publication data are available for all other scientific uses eg array design as follows publications of results should refer to the specific version or date of the data release and include the following citation c neoformans genome project stanford genome technology center funded by the niaid nih under cooperative agreement ai47087 and the institute for genomic research funded by the niaid nih under cooperative agreement u01 ai48594 users are free to download the c neoformans genome sequence for their own use and that of others within their research environment this data release policy must be displayed to all users of the downloaded data we explicitly request that users not serve our c neoformans genome sequence data to external users for an exception to our request you must receive explicit written permission from dr richard hyman by proceeding into the c neoformans genome sequence data you are acknowledging that you have read understood and will abide by the c neoformans genome project data release policy proceed
