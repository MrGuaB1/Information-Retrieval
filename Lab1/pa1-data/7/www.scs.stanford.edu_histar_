histar histar histar is a new operating system designed to minimize the amount of trusted code in a system histar provides strict information flow control which allows users to specify precise data security policies without unduly limiting the structure of applications histar's security features make it possible to implement a unix like environment with acceptable performance almost entirely in an untrusted user level library the system has no notion of superuser and no fully trusted code other than the kernel histar's features permit several novel applications including an entirely untrusted login process separation of data between virtual private networks and privacy preserving untrusted virus scanners people nickolai zeldovich silas boyd wickizer eddie kohler david mazieres publications nickolai zeldovich hari kannan michael dalton and christos kozyrakis hardware enforcement of application security policies using tagged memory in proceedings of the 8th symposium on operating systems design and implementation san diego ca december 2008 paper nickolai zeldovich silas boyd wickizer and david mazieres securing distributed systems with information flow control in proceedings of the 5th symposium on networked systems design and implementation san francisco ca april 2008 paper nickolai zeldovich securing untrustworthy software using information flow control ph d thesis stanford university october 2007 pdf nickolai zeldovich silas boyd wickizer eddie kohler and david mazieres making information flow explicit in histar in proceedings of the 7th symposium on operating systems design and implementation seattle wa november 2006 paper software histar is available through git to obtain the source code run the command git clone http www scs stanford edu histar gitrepo histar to compile histar you may need to set up a cross build environment you will need to install the gnu binutils and gcc packages see the file readme in the top level directory of the histar source tree for the appropriate configure arguments alternatively you may be able to build histar using your native compiler if histar runs on that platform currently histar runs on i386 x86_64 and sparcv8 systems edit the conf config mk file to set the k_arch variable accordingly you can also browse the histar source code histar on a cd you can download a cd image with a recent version of histar to get a feel for how it works running histar from a cd image requires at least 256mb of main memory note the cd images are about 50mb in size histar cd image for x86 64 processors histar cd image for i386 processors note that this 32 bit port is not as stable as the 64 bit version please use the 64 bit version if possible histar starts a standard unix shell on the console and comes with vim perl gcc sshd and a number of other common unix tools a few examples that use histar's security features are pre installed in the sample directory as in unix you can use cd ls and cat to navigate the file system from the shell to start the histar iso image using qemu run the command qemu system x86_64 m 256 serial stdio cdrom histar boot amd64 iso alternatively for the 32 bit i386 port run qemu m 256 serial stdio cdrom histar boot i386 iso to run histar in qemu you will need qemu version 0.9 1 or later qemu versions prior to 0.9 1 have a number of bugs that prevent histar from running properly some versions of qemu that come with ubuntu do not properly initialize pci devices so you may need to build the latest version of qemu from source in that case stanford secure computer systems group
