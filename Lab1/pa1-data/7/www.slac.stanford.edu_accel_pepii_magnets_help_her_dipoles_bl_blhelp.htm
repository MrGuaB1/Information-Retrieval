hysteresis loop measurements help file hysteresis loop measurements these measurements are made using the program bl the magnets are first cycled 3 times between 100a and 950a integral bdl measurements are then made on the up ramp and then down ramp of the hysteresis up ramp measurements are made at 500a 550a 600a 650a 700a 750a 800a 850a 900a and 950a down ramp measurements are made at 900a 800a 700a 600a and 500a the program then outputs 3 files summarizing these measurements a bllog ru contains the raw measurements made with the rotating coil both the reference magnet and the magnet under test are included b bldat ru is a summary table of calculated results using the data found in bllog ru this includes x cross calibrated integrated voltages ratio's to reference integral bdl and transfer function c blplt ru is a summary table specifically used for a plotting routine used to examine the data after a measurement is complete this is just a compressed summary of the data found in bldat ru it contains no headers titles or explanations of what the data is
