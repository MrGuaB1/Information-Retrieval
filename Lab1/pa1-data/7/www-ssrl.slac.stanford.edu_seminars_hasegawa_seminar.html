hasegawa seminar time delayed interferometry with nuclear resonant scattering at 57 fe yuji hasegawa university of tokyo the time delayed scattering in 14.4 kev moesbauer resonance at 57 fe has been intensively studied using pulsed synchrotron radiation sr source and delayed coincidence technique we report results obtained at kek of x ray interferometric experiments with this nuclear resonance there the interference arises from the beams re emitted by different nuclei with some time interval after the absorption of a single incident photon high visibility interference oscillations verified the coherent superposition as well as the complete coincidence in the time domain of the beams after the nuclear resonance the collective nuclear excitations from a single photon are discussed with regard to the no reduction of the detection probability in addition the phase information transfer through vacuum state in successive absorption and re emission with time delay and the dispersion effect at the nuclear resonance are shown ssrl welcome page research highlights beamlines accel physics user admin announcements slac july 7 1997 l dunn
