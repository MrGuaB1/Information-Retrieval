hourglass effect motivation get a better understanding on how beams coupling affect luminosity and some luminosity based measurements ie beam beam scans and babar's luminous region measurement tilt correction to geometric hourglass effect william colocho may 11 2006 review hourglass effect and zero bunch length tilt effect describe how to combine these two use mia lego model for lattice functions at ip show how to transport ip values simulation results overview hourglass luminosity formula allows for s dependence in drift space does not include tilt of beams due to coupling tilt rotation angle of beam's projection onto xy plane twist tilt along the length of the bunch the hourglass reduction factor for asymmetric colliders miguel a furman abc 21 esg technote 161 zero bunch length tilt dependence luminosity of asymmetric e e collider with coupling lattices y cai slac pub 8479 2 d gaussian 2x2 covariance matrix includes tilt angle information 2d luminosity with tilt method start with zero bunch length luminosity formula including tilt dependence zero bunch length cap sigmas at ip are calculated from mia lego model run then generate shape of luminous region dl ds by allowing the covariance matrix sigmas to change with s covariance sigma matrix s dependence the s dependence can be computed from a linear map of the beam sigma matrix in the presence of babar's 1.5 tesla solenoid field r s is the r matrix for a solenoid results s dependence of beams ellipses near ip dl ds and vertical luminous region summary questions future work hourglass and tilt effects can be combined with s dependence of the covariance matrix beam sigma transported with a linear map simulate beam beam scan with this formalism including scan at different settings of collision phase include dispersion include phase and bunch length along the train to luminosity calculation and compare with measurements
