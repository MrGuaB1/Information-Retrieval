graphics lab svn svn the lab maintains an svn repository set accessible through svn ssh do not use the svn repositories to store large amounts of binary data movies etc be careful not to step on other people's repositories location normally accessed via blit stanford edu usr graphics svn authentication authentication is done using ssh so we recommend you set up ssh identities on machines you use often otherwise you ll have to type in usernames passwords for every svn command you do checking out a repository to check out a whole repository under your current directory svn co svn ssh blit stanford edu usr graphics svn your_repository_name_here if you want to only check out a few sections of the entire repository first check out the top level only then add sections using svn update to check out only the top level of the repository svn co n svn ssh blit stanford edu usr graphics svn your_repository_name_here to list all entries that exist in the repository in your current directory svn list to add only a certain entry in the repository to your working copy svn update entry creating new repositories if you d like to add a repository for your group or project follow these steps login to graphics as yourself or whoever you want to own the repository cd usr graphics svn svnadmin create fs type fsfs your_repository_name_here this will create a new directory under usr graphics svn with your repository name you will likely need to go into the new repository directory and make at least the db subdirectory and its children group writable or you will be the only person able to check things in eg chmod r g w usr graphics svn your_repository_name_here external access currently there is no way for people without graphics labs accounts to access the svn repositories however svn does support being run through apache so if you have a need for this it can be looked into more documentation the svn book is a detailed source of information on svn usage and best practices if you have questions please ask andrew adams or eddy talvala in gates 376 who originally got the system going last update august 19 2010 09 46 02 pm 1994 2012 stanford computer graphics laboratory
