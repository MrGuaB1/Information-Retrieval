cs348b final project proposal cs 348b computer graphics image synthesis techniques final project proposal chien yu chen goal in the project i intend to render a dining room covered by heavy dust figure 1 to emphasize the oldness and loneliness i want to add the visible sun rays figure 2 in the scene figure 1 figure 2 motivations imperfect surfaces are common in real life many people however try to make their rendering perfect thus it intrigues me to render such imperfect surfaces as dusty tables chairs and so on key technical challenges simulating dusty surface blinn 1 introduced light reflection functions for dusty surface hsu and wong 2 proposed a method to model dust accumulation i have not gone through the details yet but my implementation will be probably based on these two papers rendering the visible rays to render the visible rays i plan to implement volumetric photon mapping with the participating media 3 references 1 blinn jf light reflection functions for simulation of clouds and dusty surfaces proceedings of siggraph 82 21 29 2 hsu siu chi and tien tsin wong simulating dust accumulation ieee computer graphics and applications 1995 15 1 18 25 3 henrik wann jensen and per h christensen efficient simulation of light transport in scenes with participating media using photon maps proceedings of siggraph 98 pages 311 320 orlando july 1998
