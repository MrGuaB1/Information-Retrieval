rom performance measurements page 1 1 of 3 rom performance measurements christopher o grady aug 6 1998 imperfect view of the rom suitable for this talk powerpc i960 dlink intermediate store buffers powerpc input buffers powerpc output buffers front end buffers this side for tpc only page 2 2 of 3 comments on this model the rom will acquire data at the rate of the slowest worker on the assembly line for the upc the equivalent of the tpc system's front end buffers is the intermediate store that is why in the model the equivalent of the dlink assembly line worker doesn t exist for the upc final data taking rate is affected by several variables event size number of front end elements dlink speed feature extraction time dataflow code speed both i960 and ppc for the dlinks rates are easy 16.7 ns per bit for 32 elements in parallel at 60mhz accordingly slower at 30mhz and 15mhz the model and this talk ignores the effects of several people using the busses at the same time both the i960 and the vme dma engine not yet implemented use the 33mhz pci bus and those two plus the ppc processor will use the 66mhz ppc memory bus this is a potential bottleneck page 3 3 of 3 random comments & conclusion this talk will show you the rates for each of the workers all measurements done with odf compiled o2 and pmc flash v6 1 o2 compilation cannot currently be done in v00 02 00 but will be included in next release by default the powerpc cpu utilization tool is not in default dataflow vxworks kernel but will be soon this is third party software dataflow has classes that will allow the subsystems to time their ppc code if you want to use it let us know and we ll show you conclusion in advance dataflow is doing well so far can t make system crash at high rates have pushed it as high as 35khz with small event size backpressure seems to work as designed users will have to write good rom code to keep up
