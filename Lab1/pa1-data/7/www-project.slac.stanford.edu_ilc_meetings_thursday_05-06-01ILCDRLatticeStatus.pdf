status of ilc dr lattices for configuration option studies page 1 status of ilc dr lattices for configuration option studies andy wolski lawrence berkeley national laboratory us ilc dr teleconference june 2005 page 2 the objective is to collect information for the bcd the baseline configuration document bcd will specify the configuration of the ilc for the damping rings the bcd should answer the questions why is the circumference x why is the energy y why does the wiggler use z magnet technology what other options were considered what are the alternatives that could still be considered to a reduce risk or b reduce cost bcd should be ready by the end of 2005 page 3 we have 8 lattices covering the various options tme 5.0 17000 tesla 17 km dco pi 5.0 17014 das fodo 5.0 15935 mch fodo 3.74 6333 bru tme 5.066 6114 ocs tme 5.0 3223 otw pi 5.0 2824 ppa cell structure energy gev circumference m lattice mad decks are at http www desy de awolski ilcdr lattices htm page 4 the megatable lists the principal parameters page 5 most lattices are nearly complete in most cases only the fill pattern remains to be specified fill pattern is important for coupled bunch effects electron cloud ions resistive wall homs phase transients circumference is constrained by specified fill pattern and vice versa there are some other miscellaneous issues dco lattice may not be available for a while ocs lattice may be retuned away from the integer resonance some lattices include various options for example mch 16 km 5 gev can be used with or without coupling bumps with or without vertical bends to follow earth's curvature page 6 status of working groups 1 international wg3 conveners have contacted people to co ordinate subgroups to carry out studies in a number of areas 1 dynamic aperture and acceptance 2 vertical emittance simulations sensitivities tuning stray field effects 3 vertical emittance experiments 4 classical instabilities 5 space charge 6 kickers 7 electron cloud 8 fast ion 9 cost estimates 10 beam losses 11 polarization preservation 12 predamping ring studies page 7 status of working groups 2 international wg3 conveners will announce the full list of coordinators shortly some responses are still being collected coordinators will 1 produce a short statement explicitly specifying the results they aim to produce to support the configuration selection 2 contact the community to invite participation in the studies and decide who does what 3 be responsible for ensuring that tools are applied systematically and for communicating results an emailing list has been set up to facilitate communication see http www desy de awolski ilcdr for details please sign up 2nd ilc workshop snowmass august 2005 will be an opportunity for reviewing progress
