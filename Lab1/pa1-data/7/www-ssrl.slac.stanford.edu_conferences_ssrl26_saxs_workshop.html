saxs workshop a workshop to be held at the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory in conjunction with the 26 th annual users conference date tuesday october 12 1999 time 1 30 5 00pm this workshop is designed as a series of relatively informal lectures in which users in the small angle x ray scattering saxs community will share their experience in their particular application of saxs techniques fields which will be reviewed include materials science applications where selective doping produces novel rheological characteristics within elastomeric polypropylene materials synthesis where living polymerization techniques permit construction of dendrimer structures for drug delivery systems and biological applications in the determination of low resolution structures of large protein complexes and the association and folding states of proteins this workshop will review prominent experimental work which has been conducted on the small angle x ray scattering beamlines by users of the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory over the past year and thereby highlight novel avenues of research for the future for further information please contact john pople 650 926 8677 pople ssrl slac stanford edu register rtf form ssrl26 home page
