sgtc letter to science data release stanford genome technology center additional considerations concerning our data release policy we have received requests asking us to amplify upon our data release policy in response we are posting the following letter to the editor of science published in the 2 february 2001 issue volume 291 page 827 sequence data posted vs published large scale dna sequencing projects take a considerable amount of time to complete including 2 to 3 years for the final or finishing stage this fact is not always appreciated by those who are not directly involved in such efforts as appears to be the case with elaine bell in her letter 1 dec p 1696 about the policy forum by lee rowen et al publication rights in the era of open data release policies 15 sept p 1881 in her letter bell as editor of immunology today discusses what factors were considered in the decision to publish two articles that contained information from publicly available sequence data that had not been previously published a major factor according to her was the length of time that the primary sequence had been available in the public domain but the time referred to about a year is not adequate for such projects given the nature of the work involved large scale sequencing projects can be divided into three unequal stages i random shotgun sequencing a relatively fast process ii assembly of the shotgun data done many times during the course of the project and iii finishing during finishing physical gaps in the sequence are closed ambiguities in the sequence are resolved contaminating sequences are removed and errors in the sequence are identified and corrected finishing is a slow process often taking 2 to 3 years for large sequencing projects thus the almost complete sequence will be available for an extended length of time while the sequence is completed and published posted sequence from stages two and three as well as sequence found in the genbank database is easily distinguished from published sequence the posted sequence is often incomplete might contain errors and contamination and has not gone through peer review in fact the high throughput genome sequence section of genbank was established precisely to contain sequences not yet sufficiently complete and secure to be published thus posted sequences are public but they are not thereby automatically in the public domain unpublished sequence should be treated as are all other unpublished scientific data therefore a third party who wants to publish an analysis of other scientists unpublished sequence should obtain the written consent of those other scientists absent that consent that third party would be committing a misappropriation of data as defined by the national institutes of health nih http ori dhhs gov html misconduct regulation asp as such misappropriation of data is one of the nih definitions of plagiarism as a general working definition office of research integrity considers plagiarism to include both the theft or misappropriation of intellectual property and the substantial unattributed textual copying of another's work plagiarism is one definition of fraud in science richard w hyman stanford genome technology center department of biochemistry stanford university 855 california avenue palo alto ca 94304 usa e mail rhyman stanford edu sgtc home
