divergence or failure to converge in the nonlinear solution next up previous contents next residuals bottom out up overcoming numerical difficulties previous overcoming numerical difficulties divergence or failure to converge in the nonlinear solution potential causes of divergence in the nonlinear solution include taking too large of a time step the initial guess is outside of the region of convergence for the newton method an incorrect system of equations suggestions try taking a smaller initial time step or use estimateinitialtimestep turn on useconvergeheuristics carefully validate that the model is implemented correctly and that the systems of equations are well posed too few boundary conditions ie an underconstrained system of equations can also lead to wandering and divergence try turning on applydamping the damped newton will likely converge very slowly and this should be used only as a last resort dan yergeau wed aug 20 14 01 54 pdt 1997
