assignment 4 architecture and interiors assignment 4 architecture and interiors garner garner kropp requirement 5 interior panorama f 4 1 13 10mm this was the hardest part of the assignment i found a section in the boardwalk that i could only capture with panorama in the arcade there was this line with eighteen pinball machines surrounding you which is a pretty overwhelming sensory experience by getting it in a panorama you get the full sense of just how lost in the color and sound if you can image all those pinball noises you are at this spot making it all happen in ps was actually much harder than i though i thought i could eek out some straight lines and do the perspective stitching but because the lens was short and i was so close to the subjects i guess that cylindrical was the only way to go i kind of like it though a double fisheye previous back to all photos next
