total reflection home up feedback contents please note wafer level txrf measurements are no longer available details on txrf home page home up total reflection is a process that occurs when snell's law for refraction can no longer be solved for real angles as shown in the figure below light from one medium when entering a different medium is both reflected and refracted with the refracted angle being given by snell's law for typical wavelengths visible infrared ultraviolet a vacuum has the lowest index of refraction n 1 while other media have indices that are greater than 1 thus it is possible to achieve total internal reflection when the refracted angle becomes complex for x rays a solid medium is optically less dense than a vacuum and thus total external reflection occurs when the condition of total external reflection holds the penetration depth of the incident x ray beam is only a few tens of angstroms and the reflectivity is near unity as shown in the figure below naturally as the angle is increased past the critical angle the reflectivity decrease rapidly while the penetration depth increases our experiment are done at a condition of total external reflection to provide for a surface sensitive beam that will only excite surface level atoms and to generate x ray standing waves that increase the fluorescence intensity from excited atoms send mail to pianetta stanford edu with questions or comments about this web site last modified january 26 2007
