stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory bl6 2 stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory txm overview txm imaging researchers publications txm srl full field transmission x ray microscopy capabilities the transmission x ray microscope txm on beam line 6 2c at ssrl is capable of 2d imaging and tomography of many materials including biological and environmental samples and complex hierarchical systems such as fuel cells and battery electrodes with chemical information at 30 nm resolution the field of view fov is 30 microns but samples can be raster scanned to increase the fov while maintaining the same resolution because the microscope is equipped with optics that can be used from 5 to 14 kev it is useful for characterizing metal distribution and chemical states by imaging at x ray absorption edges for many metals involved in energy materials 3d elemental mapping is accomplished via acquisition of tomography above and below the x ray absorption edge 2d mapping of chemical states is accomplished with xanes x ray absorption near edge structure imaging in which many images are acquired along the x ray absorption edge of a metal and constructed spectra can be compared to those for model compounds of known structure it is also possible to acquire 3d xanes tomography in which chemical states can be mapped in 3d current energy applications fuel cells and batteries both involve nanoscale electrochemical surface phenomena which can be characterized using txm for effective catalysis fuel cells require transport of electrons and ions and therefore studies of porosity and chemical states and particle size of particular elements as a function of reaction conditions can be very valuable for optimization of charging and discharging of battery electrodes it is important to be able to determine oxidation states and correlate these with morphological changes this can be accomplished with 2d and 3d xanes imaging to determine nanoscale chemistry as well as single energy tomography to determine porosity and tortuosity for future work we plan imaging of in situ battery electrodes and fuel cells normal mouse tibia trabecular region in microct at 10 m resolution left followed by 20x objective differential interference contrast picture of a single thin trabecula at 0.75 m resolution center followed by txm mosaic composite with phase contrast at 8 kev with 40 nm resolution right each frame is 13.9 m square background removal was improved using adobe photoshop downloads & links pdf icon if you would like to read the full research paper please click on the pdf icon to download the research paper that explores the new txm imaging technology at ssrl advance the understanding of biological systems absorption tomography phase contrast examples of work involving the txm we have developed imaging capabilities for zernike phase contrast and absorption contrast over a wide energy range and built up a strong user community in a variety of fields in addition to imaging of yeast cells chen et al 2010 andrews et al aip 2010 liu et al 2010 we have observed microorganisms thought to be involved in mercury methylation patty et al 2009 and imaged patterns of arsenic accumulation in rice seyfferth et al 2010 we were able to quantify mineral content in bone and other mineralized tissue using tomography and calibration with an apatite standard andrews et al microsc microanal 2010 over this time we began to use the energy tuning capability of the beam line to add chemistry to distinguish elements moore 2009 and to quantify attenuation coefficients to identify chemical elements present andrews et al microsc res tech 2010 liu et al 2010 we have also begun to distinguish chemical speciation in 2d liu et al 2010 and to perform initial work on 3d xanes imaging meirer et al 2011 bl6 2
