exafspak exafspak slac exafspak is a suite of xas data analysis programs developed by dr gn george of ssrl features include a degree of automation an efficient curve fitting algorithm using analytically calculated derivatives allowing more rapid convergence to the best fit than with numerically calculated ones other features include the ability to link different variables together in the curve fitting process and the availability of search routines and best integer fitting functionality the curve fitter can utilize the ab initio multiple scattering code feff the exafspak programs use character cell based menus running from a terminal environment a variety of graphical outputs is supported x windows regis tektronix both 10 and 12 bit hpgl postscript ps and encapsulated postscript eps programs for producing publication quality figures are part of the package exafspak is written predominantly in fortran with smaller sections in c versions are currently available for open vms both vax and alpha for tru64 unix alpha for linux and for windows click here to download files ssrl welcome page research highlights beam lines accel physics user admin announcements last updated 20 apr 2001 content owner graham george page editor lisa dunn
