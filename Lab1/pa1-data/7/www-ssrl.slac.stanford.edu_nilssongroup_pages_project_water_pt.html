surface science group research projects surface science and x ray spectr oscopy group stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory stanford linear accelerator center current research projects structure and bonding of water on pt 111 we address the adsorption of water on pt 111 using x ray absorption x ray emission and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy along with calculations in the framework of density functional theory using the direct relationship between the electronic structure and adsorbate geometry we show that in the first layer all the molecules bind directly to the surface and to each othe through the in in layer h bonds without dissociation creating a nearly flat overlayer the water molecules are adsorbed through alternating metal oxygen m o and metal hydrogen m ho bonds this gives new insight to a fundamental question in electrochemistry that has been the subject of much controversy for the last two decades this finding may help to better understand corrosion and the ca talytic reactions exploited by hydrogen fuel cells
