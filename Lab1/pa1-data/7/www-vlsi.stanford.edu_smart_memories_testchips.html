test chips page smart memories test chips memory test chip in february of 2003 we taped out a reconfigurable memory test chip on the tsmc 0.18 um process the test chip consisted of 4 memory blocks a low swing crossbar and testing infrastructure circuits the chips were successfully tested in the lab operating at 1.1 ghz clock frequency at nominal voltage of 1.8 volts figure 1 results were published in 2004 isscc conference k mai r ho e alon d liu y kim d patil and m horowitz architecture and circuit techniques for a reconfigurable memory block isscc february 2004 figure 1 smart memories test chip memory blocks and low swing crossbar interconnect test chip in april of 2002 we taped out a low swing interconnect test chip on the tsmc 0.18 um process figure 2 the test chip consisted of multiple low swing bus topologies as well as some full swing buses for comparison the test chip also contained a sense amplifier offset measurement block later re spawn on a national 0.25 um process the chips have been tested and a paper is presented at the 2003 vlsi circuits symposium r ho k mai m horowitz efficient on chip global interconnects ieee symposium on vlsi circuits june 2003 figure 2 low swing interconnect test chip
