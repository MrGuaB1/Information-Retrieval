bending magnet home up feedback contents please note wafer level txrf measurements are no longer available details on txrf home page home up originally the sole purpose of a synchrotron was to act a storage ring for linear accelerators and to achieve this circular orbit bending magnets were used while these first generation devices created x ray radiation that were later suitable for high energy x ray experiments it was found that the intensity could be increased by employing the use of a wiggler insertion device wigglers work by using an array of magnets with alternating field directions to force electrons into a sinusoidal trajectory through the straight sections of a synchrotron this leads to a higher emitted intensity when compared to bending magnets shown below is a schematic of a wiggler along with emitted intensities for various wigglers and bending magnets at beamline 6 2 a 1 tesla 54 pole wiggler is used 27 periods of 7.0 cm is used to generate a 5x4 0 mm focused x ray beam with an energy range from 2.05 kev to 22kev send mail to pianetta stanford edu with questions or comments about this web site last modified january 26 2007
