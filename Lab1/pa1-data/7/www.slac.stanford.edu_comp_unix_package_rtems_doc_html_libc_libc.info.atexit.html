libc info atexit libc info atexit go forward to atof go backward to assert go up to stdlib go to the top op libc atexit request execution of functions at program exit synopsis include stdlib h int atexit void function void description you can use atexit to enroll functions in a list of functions that will be called when your program terminates normally the argument is a pointer to a user defined function which must not require arguments and must not return a result the functions are kept in a lifo stack that is the last function enrolled by atexit will be the first to execute when your program exits there is no built in limit to the number of functions you can enroll in this list however after every group of 32 functions is enrolled atexit will call malloc to get space for the next part of the list the initial list of 32 functions is statically allocated so you can always count on at least that many slots available returns atexit returns 0 if it succeeds in enrolling your function 1 if it fails possible only if no space was available for malloc to extend the list of functions portability atexit is required by the ansi standard which also specifies that implementations must support enrolling at least 32 functions supporting os subroutines required close fstat isatty lseek read sbrk write created mon nov 8 17 42 52 2004 on tillpc with info_to_html version 0.9 6
