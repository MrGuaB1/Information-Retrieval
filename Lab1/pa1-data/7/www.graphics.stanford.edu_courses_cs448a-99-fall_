syllabus cs448a interactive workplaces most of today's computing environments are designed to support the interaction between one person and one computer the user sits at a workstation or laptop or holds a pda focusing on a single device at a time even if there are several around and they are linked and synchronized collaboration is accomplished over the network using email shared files or in some cases explicitly designed groupware in non computerized work settings on the other hand people interact in a rich environment that includes information from many sources paper whiteboards computers physical models etc and are able to use these simultaneously and move among them flexibly and quickly the few existing integrated multi device computer environments today tend to be highly specialized and based on application specific software we are designing and experimenting with multi device multi user environments based on a new architecture that makes it easy to create and add new display and input devices to move work of all kinds from one computing device to another and to support and facilitate group interactions in the same way that today's standard operating systems make it feasible to write single workstation software that makes use of multiple devices and networked resources we are constructing a higher level operating system for the world of ubiquitous computing the interactive room located in gates b23 is a testbed for combining multiple devices in an integrated environment the emphasis in the research is on developing an appropriate infrastructure that can support a wide variety of configurations and on developing interaction methods that are appropriate for a multi person multi device setting it is equipped with several large wall based displays rear projection smartboards and a front projection surface a bottom projected table and a variety of servers and additional devices which will change as the project develops it incorporates a unified event architecture that supports applications in using multiple devices and displays and will have a room context database that supports the task and project aspects of the work the goal of this course is to explore what new applications are possible within interactive workplaces and what new technologies need to be developed to enable these applications we will begin with a series of background lectures on the basics of interactive workspaces including their history new input and output technologies to support table wall and room environments computer supported cooperative work cscw systems and system technologies for building these environments there will also be 3 4 guest lectures from industry and discussion and debates on controversial topics of interest students will form into a small number of project teams each building a working application in the interactive workspace laboratory the class is open to students with a background in computer graphics and visualization human computer interfaces and systems for ubiquitous computing enrollment is limited to 20 instructors pat hanrahan hanrahan cs stanford edu room 370 gates computer science building 650 723 8530 terry winograd winograd cs stanford edu room 388 gates computer science building 650 723 2780 with guest lectures from armando fox fox cs stanford edu room 446 gates computer science building 650 723 9558 teaching assistant brad johanson bjohanso graphics stanford edu room 376 gates computer science building 650 723 1604 place when 2 30 3 45pm tu th where graphics conference room gates room 392 home page http graphics stanford edu courses cs448a 99 fall mailing lists instructors cs448a graphics stanford edu students cs448a students graphics stanford edu schedule readings assignments homework 1 assignment submissions project proposal preliminary project groups submissions final deliverables final projects final project demo schedule final papers
