preface page 1 preface the twenty third annual conference physics in collision was held at desy in zeuthen germany from june 26 to 28 2003 the lecture hall was located on the top floor of an old accelerator building near the zeuthener see situated in the pine forests of brandenburg the spirit of the physics in collision conference is to provide a forum for the presentation of comprehensive reviews of elementary particle physics and closely related topics in fundamental physics the conference was attended by about 120 physicists from asia europe and north and south america in the three conference days twenty eight review talks were given by invited speakers covering the most recent results on particle physics astroparticle physics and observational cos mology these were arranged in six plenary sessions neutrino physics astro and astroparticle physics searches for new phenomena flavor physics qcd electroweak precision physics among the topics surveyed were the evidence for neutrino oscillations using solar and reactor neutrinos the measurement of cp violation in b decays the heavy flavor and quarkonia production at the highest energies in ep and pp scattering qcd in e+e and ep scattering the combined results on w physics at lep the measurements of electroweak physics using the new data from the tevatron the g 2 measurement from muons and the observational cosmology with emphasis on the new results from wmap and dasi twenty four presentations were accepted for the poster sessions covering topics from elec troweak phenomenology to detector research and technology all the conference speakers took their assignments seriously and presented outstanding re views their prompt submission of the written contributions to these proceedings is gratefully acknowledged sabine riemann and wolfgang lohmann iv
