uribe abstraction based deductive algorithmic verification of reactive systems phd thesis abstraction based deductive algorithmic verification of reactive systems phd thesis this thesis presents a framework that combines deductive and algorithmic methods for verifying temporal properties of reactive systems to allow more automatic verification of general infinite state systems and the verification of larger finite state ones underlying these deductive algorithmic methods is the theory of property preserving assertion based abstractions where a finite state abstraction of the system is deductively justified and algorithmically model checked after presenting an abstraction framework that accounts for fairness we describe a method to automatically generate finite state abstractions we then show how a number of other methods including deductive rules generalized verification diagrams and deductive model checking can also be understood as constructing finite state versions of the system that are model checked this analysis leads to a better classification and understanding of these verification methods furthermore it shows how the different abstractions that they construct can be combined for this we present an algorithmic extended abstract model checking procedure which uses all the information produced by these methods expressed in a finite state format that can be easily and incrementally combined besides a standard safety component the combined abstractions include extra bounds on fair transitions well founded orders and constrained transition relations for the generation of counterexamples thus our approach minimizes the need for user interaction and maximizes the impact of the available automated deduction and model checking tools once proved verification conditions are reused as much as possible leaving the temporal and combinatorial reasoning to automatic tools postscript pdf 1998 tomas uribe last modified thu mar 29 11 15 59 pst 2001
