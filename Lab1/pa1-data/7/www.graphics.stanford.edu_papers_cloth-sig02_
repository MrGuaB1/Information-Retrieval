robust treatment of collisions contact and friction for cloth animation robust treatment of collisions contact and friction for cloth animation robert bridson stanford university ronald fedkiw stanford university john anderson industrial light and magic published in siggraph 2002 abstract we present an algorithm to efficiently and robustly process collisions contact and friction in cloth simulation it works with any technique for simulating the internal dynamics of the cloth and allows true modeling of cloth thickness we also show how our simulation data can be post processed with a collision aware subdivision scheme to produce smooth and interference free data for rendering pdf 2.2 mb
