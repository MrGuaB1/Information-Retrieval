vacuum chamber calculations vacuum pressure calculations vaccalc the program vaccalc was used for all calculations the program required three pieces of information for each chamber pumping conductance and outgassing using the given information the program calculates the pressure at any point along the entire tube chamber design her downstream ler upstream ler downstream her upstream support chamber q5 neg q5 neg 66.114 m 69.33 m st plot plot plot plot plot 1 2 3 4 5 6 assumptions bertollini's numbers on outgassing were true 2000 l s m pumping for all neg pumps with b or c screens 1000 l s m pumping for all neg pumps with a or d screens 1000 l s m pumping for all ion pumps 150 l s pump over 0.15 m data conductance remains a constant throughout the ler tubes lengths were taken from drawings and tables this is a work in progress making it difficult to draw final conclusions from the plots cases baseline design no radial pumps no c pumps no upstream q4 pump no q4 pump with ion pump ler q5 not pumping ler q5 outgassing no q4 pump with ion pump and frangible pump ler q5 not pumping with frangible link pump ler q5 outgassing with frangible link pump no c pumps q4 and q5 outgassing no q4 and q5 outgassing baseline design support tube upstream her upstream ler downstream her downstream ler no radial pumps no c pumps upstream support tube upstream ler no upstream q4 pump support tube upstream ler no q4 pump with ion pump q5 not pumping q5 outgassing no q4 pump with ion and frangible pump q5 not pumping with frangible link pump q5 outgassing with frangible link pump no c pumps upstream support tube upstream ler q4 and her q5 outgassing support tube upstream her upstream ler no q4 and her q5 outgassing support tube upstream her upstream ler next steps test other possible combinations finish the her upstream downstream recalculate outgassing numbers check pump speed numbers screen conductances
