colon sipma synthesis of linear ranking functions synthesis of linear ranking functions michael colon henny sipma deductive verification of progress properties relies on finding ranking functions to prove termination of program cycles we present an algorithm to synthesize linear ranking functions that can establish such termination fundamental to our approach is the representation of systems of linear inequalities and sets of linear expressions as polyhedral cones this representation allows us to reduce the search for linear ranking functions to the computation of polars intersections and projections of polyhedral cones problems which have well known solutions in 7th international conference on tools and algorithms for the construction and analysis of systems tacas lncs 2031 springer verlag pp 67 81 2001 postscript pdf 2001 springer verlag henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu last modified thu jul 12 14 42 04 pdt 2001
