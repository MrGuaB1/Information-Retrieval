gnu coding standards using non standard features go to the previous next section using non standard features many gnu facilities that already exist support a number of convenient extensions over the comparable unix facilities whether to use these extensions in implementing your program is a difficult question on the one hand using the extensions can make a cleaner program on the other hand people will not be able to build the program unless the other gnu tools are available this might cause the program to work on fewer kinds of machines with some extensions it might be easy to provide both alternatives for example you can define functions with a keyword inline and define that as a macro to expand into either inline or nothing depending on the compiler in general perhaps it is best not to use the extensions if you can straightforwardly do without them but to use the extensions if they are a big improvement an exception to this rule are the large established programs such as emacs which run on a great variety of systems such programs would be broken by use of gnu extensions another exception is for programs that are used as part of compilation anything that must be compiled with other compilers in order to bootstrap the gnu compilation facilities if these require the gnu compiler then no one can compile them without having them installed already that would be no good since most computer systems do not yet implement ansi c using the ansi c features is effectively using a gnu extension so the same considerations apply except for ansi features that we discourage such as trigraphs don t ever use them go to the previous next section
