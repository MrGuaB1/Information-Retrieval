27 july 2k 27 july 2k orion facility meeting clay corvin dennis palmer bob siemann and dieter waltz coordination nlc and orion project offices is a must ac power corvin has identified and allocated one of the two spare breakers located in the 3m substation next to the nlcta for orion's exclusive use h20 discussion about lcw using the lcw pad located at end station cable racks nlc will in the near future decide where they would like to have additional cable racks located in the end station to support nlc r&d development the initial orion cable rack installation philology was discussed in principle orion would like to use the trenches to transport ac power to the far side of the end station this would allow orion to locate its ac distribution system in any of a number of empty power distribution sheds ladder the access ladder to the orion injector facility should be relocated to the west end of the end station laser room 1 permanent installation can it go on the roof of the shielded enclosure source area extending the shielded enclosure near the source to allow for the installation of the rf gun was discussed dieter thinks that moving the dc gun and injector system off axis to allow for the rf gun to be installed in line with present accelerator system will be very costly during a walk turn at orion the possibility of holding up the present and future roof blocks in the source region was discussed it is thought that this would be the least costly method of extending the width of the enclosure in the source region efd we would like to have the efd work shops and office spaces located near the north side of the orion facility how much power will this building need and where will they get it control room the orion injector will be controlled from the present nlcta control room some additional rack space will be necessary for the upgrade of the control system low energy hall beam line peneration during the orion facility walk turn green tape was placed on the outside wall of the enclosure to locate the beginning and end of the beam line penetration for the low energy hall if beam dynamics simulations indicate that we can control the beam with a quad focusing system on either side of the enclosure this would be the best and least costly solution to the problem since moving the roof blocks would initiate a temporary removal of a significant amount of x band rf hardware end station b plan view preliminary alignment end station b elevation view east action items alignment crew will make a more precise measurement of the penetration locations dtp will conduct beam dynamics simulation to design the low energy hall dog leg from the orion injector to the low energy hall with the specific goal of not needing to locate any focusing elements in the shielding blocks since that would require the removal of the roof block and x band rf hardware high energy hall we should look into boring through the beam dump and shielding the magnet field present in the steel that makes up the beam dump
