abstract behavior during interracial interactions is often negative leading to negative interpersonal outcomes extant researc page 1 abstract behavior during interracial interactions is often negative leading to negative interpersonal outcomes extant research has investigated race related individual differences eg racial bias as the cause of such behavior however this research literature is replete with discrepancies instead the present work examines behavior during interracial interactions within the framework of the stress and coping literature in this work we propose that interracial contact is often appraised as a threat and as such elicits stress and coping responses in other words we propose that the behavioral dynamics of interracial interactions can be understood as distinct coping responses via antagonism avoidance freezing and engagement to stressful encounters consistent with this proposition the present work provides evidence that whites attentional biases set the stage for stress and coping in response to interracial contact study 1 and that whites behavior studies 2 and 3 and physiology study 4 during interracial contact map onto stress and coping responses moreover stress associated with interracial contact may have long term effects on physiological stress system functioning study5 taken together these data provide converging evidence that whites appraise interracial contact as a threat experience stress and subsequently cope with their stress consistent with a stress and coping framework implications for research and race relations will be discussed
