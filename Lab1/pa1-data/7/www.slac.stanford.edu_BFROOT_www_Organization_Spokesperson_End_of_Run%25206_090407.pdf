dear colleagues page 1 dear colleagues this morning at 6 00 am we reached the end of run 6 and the beginning of a 3 month downtime for pepii and babar as you know this was a difficult run but ultimately the knowledge skill and dedication of our pepii colleagues brought it to conclusion with a very positive slope achieving peak luminosity of 11.7 x10 33 cm2 s with best ever 30 day integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb and best week at 5.4 fb the total delivered luminosities for run 6 is 90.2 fb 86.4 fb recorded by babar bringing the total delivered from the beginning of pepii operations to 500 fb on behalf of the collaboration i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and express our appreciation to our pepii colleagues and wish them even greater success for run 7 on the babar side in its first run with a fully upgraded ifr system the detector performed very well the analysis of the data indicates that our muon id capability is fully restored in fact outperforming the initial system with rpc's congratulations to the ifr upgrade team and the babar operation team for the success of this run in past few weeks as we were approaching the end of run 6 the pepii team has been carrying out a number of md's focused on understanding the machine performance in preparation for raising the luminosity in run 7 these include a successful initial test of the 90 degree lattice which is prerequisite for lowering the vertical beta raising the her and ler currents testing the rf system and studies of the beam beam effects and beam couplings during the 3 month downtime in addition to the routine maintenance and certification of the safety system the final phase of the pepii upgrade will take place which includes replacing 150 rf seals in her and a few vacuum chambers near ir these upgrades are critical to running at higher currents planned for run 7 the downtime work on the babar detector are primarily of maintenance and corrective nature no major upgrades are planned for this period babar has also been preparing for the operational implications of the expected higher luminosities of run 7 which may be accompanied by higher backgrounds these include changes to the data flow systems of svt dirc and emc to reduce the data rate as well as creation of a new emergency level 1 trigger configuration all to generate headroom should the background induced level 1 trigger rise significantly during run 7 on the computing front preparation of run7 release is going well and the full skimming of runs 1 6 is still on going a major validation effort is planned for run 7 release in october new computing resources that are expected to be made available soon at slac are critical to completion of these tasks before the start of run 7 computing the run 7 data will require further resources planned for availability by end of the year i would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the talent and dedication of babar computing team that despite serious limitations on the timing of the availability of computing resources made it possible page 2 for the collaboration to present a rich harvest of physics results to conferences and for publication a few announcements the september collaboration meeting in orsay the webpage and the draft agenda for the meeting are now posted http polywww in2p3 fr actualites congres bcm2007 http www slac stanford edu bfroot www organization collabmtgs 2007 de tsep07 sep2007agenda pdf as it is the tradition of the off site collaboration meetings at this meeting we hope to do a little bit less on today's issues and a little bit more on tomorrow's plans babar symposium in 2008 we have began the initial discussion for planning a babar symposium in 2008 to celebrate the conclusion of the data taking phase of the experiment and the start of intense analysis period we expect this event to take place during the collaboration meeting in september october 2008 we will provide more information on this topic after the collaboration meeting in orsay tanaka dissertation award the chair of the committee ron poling has asked us to let you know that the deadline for this prestigious award has been extended to october 1 2007 please consider nominating your outstanding recent ph d students more detailed information can be found at http www aps org programs honors dissertation tanaka cfm cleo and cesr symposium we have been asked by our cleo colleagues to announce this event which has been organized to celebrate the scientific impact of cesr and cleo and the end of data taking with cleo c in spring of 2008 http www lepp cornell edu events cleocesrsymp hope to see you soon here or at the cm in orsay with best regards hassan for the babar management
