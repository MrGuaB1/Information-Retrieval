man page lookup pipe pipe 2 openbsd programmer's manual pipe 2 name pipe create descriptor pair for interprocess communication synopsis include unistd h int pipe int fildes 2 description the pipe function creates a pipe which is an object allowing unidirec tional data flow and allocates a pair of file descriptors the first descriptor connects to the read end of the pipe and the second connects to the write end so that data written to fildes 1 appears on ie can be read from fildes 0 this allows the output of one program to be sent to another program the source's standard output is set up to be the write end of the pipe and the sink's standard input is set up to be the read end of the pipe the pipe itself persists until all its associated descriptors are closed a pipe whose read or write end has been closed is considered widowed writing on such a pipe causes the writing process to receive a sigpipe signal widowing a pipe is the only way to deliver end of file to a reader after the reader consumes any buffered data reading a widowed pipe returns a zero count return values on successful creation of the pipe zero is returned otherwise a value of 1 is returned and the variable errno set to indicate the error errors the pipe call will fail if emfile too many descriptors are active enfile the system file table is full efault the fildes buffer is in an invalid area of the process's address space see also sh 1 fork 2 read 2 socketpair 2 write 2 standards the pipe function conforms to ieee std 1003.1 1988 posix as an extension the pipe provided is actually capable of moving data bidirectionally this is compatible with svr4 however this is non posix behaviour which should not be relied on for reasons of portabili ty history a pipe function call appeared in version 3 at&t unix openbsd 3.5 june 4 1993 1
