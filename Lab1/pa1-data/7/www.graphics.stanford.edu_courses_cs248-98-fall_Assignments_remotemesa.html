mesa vs glx using mesa to run opengl remotely thanks to alex roetter for writing this up note we won t be able to support this or answer questions about it but are providing this info since it will probably be useful for a while i was trying to be able to display opengl programs remotely which is complicated by the use of glx extensions i finally figured it out and thought that it might be useful for other students there is a opengl compatible library called mesa which only makes standard x calls not glx calls the source is available at http www ssec wisc edu brianp mesa html however a pre built version of the libraries for sgi can be found on the leland systems at aroetter public lib since gl is linked in dynamically you can override the order in which the system searches for libraries to have it find the mesa libraries first so it will run with those and hence display anywhere to do this copy the mesa libraries into some directory and then set up links so the system thinks they are the opengl libraries by typing ln s libmesagl so libgl so ln s libmesaglu so libglu so then you can set the environment variable ld_library_path to be the directory where you installed the libraries setenv ld_library_path some directory here does it with csh tcsh after that just set your display and any gl program even the pre built demos will run anywhere without needing to recompile it this is slower than using gl but it is good for times when you don t have enough time to justify getting over to sweet hall but just want to work for a few minutes cs248 introduction to computer graphics pat hanrahan winter 98
