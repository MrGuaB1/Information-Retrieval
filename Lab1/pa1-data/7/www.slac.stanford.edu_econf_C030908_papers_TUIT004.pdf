a feldman cousins likelihood analysis of soudan 2 data for atmospheric neutrino oscillations page 1 a feldman cousins likelihood analysis of soudan 2 data for atmospheric neutrino oscillations peter j litchfield minnesota university minneapolis mn 55455 usa a bin free feldman cousins style likelihood analysis has been carried out on soudan 2 atmospheric neutrino data reference is given to a full description of the statistical methods used a likelihood analysis scheme has been developed for the determination of neutrino oscillation parameters from atmospheric neutrino data using the feldman cousins prescription 1 the features that distinguish this analysis are 1 the data are used without binning 2 background events are fully integrated into the formalism 3 pdfs for the likelihood function are calculated by gaussian smearing of monte carlo and back ground data 4 nuisance parameters background fractions and data normalization are determined in an inte grated manner 5 systematic errors in calibration fluxes and cross sections are incorporated in the feldman cousins analysis and 6 the feldman cousins scheme gives proper cover age for the 90 confidence region determination and for the discrimination against the no oscil lation hypothesis the resultant 90 confidence levels on the oscillation parameters were shown and it was demonstrated that the data agreed with the expected sensitivity of the data and that not using the full feldman cousins pro cedure would have seriously underestimated the al lowed region full details of the analysis are given in reference 2 including the full mathematical formalism references 1 gj feldman and rd cousins phys rev d57 3873 1998 2 m sanchez et al phys rev d68 to be published and hep ex 0307069 phystat2003 slac stanford california september 8 11 2003 175
