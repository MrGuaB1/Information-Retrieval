html basics headings html basics stanford university libraries & academic information resources headings previous page tutorial top tech guide next page html defines six heading levels h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 these should be thought of as roughly analogous to chapters sections and subsections etc in a conventional document in general the intent of a heading is to say something about the text that follows the heading see below for some grudged exceptions tim berners lee principal architect of the world wide web put it clearly always use heading levels in order with one heading level 1 at the top of the document and if necessary several level 2 headings and then if necessary several level 3 headings under each level 2 heading if you don t like the way heading level 2 is formatted fix it on your client don t just skip to heading level 3 he said some other good things that are well worth reading the key point is that h1 should identify the major heading for the document and that h2 h3 etc should identify succesive nested sections and subsections within a heading although it isn t made explicit in the syntax of html it is unquestionable that every document should have exactly one and only one h1 element determining heading level a very good way to determine which heading level is appropriate for a particular portion of your document is to consider how that section would be treated in an outline with the title of the document being heading level one for an outline with headers numbered in this fashion 1 chapter 19 1.1 1.2 1.2 1 1.2 1.1 1.3 you can directly translate the number of subsection fields to heading levels thus outline number heading level ______________ _____________ 1 chapter 19 h1 1.1 h2 1.2 h2 1.2 1 h3 1.2 1.1 h4 1.3 h2 note that using this method will guarantee that you obey the use heading levels in order exceptions sometimes documents have a small quantity of preliminary material such as a journal title volume and issue number that is repeated from article to article it is not always inappropriate to do something like h3 scientific american br january 1995 h3 h1 ensuring the longevity of digital documents h1 similarly repeated material at the tail of every document might appropriately be given the same kind of markup even if it violates the general rule misuse it is common but regretable practice to use headings in order to achieve the typographic effect which they happen to produce on one browser or another often authors think that h1 is bigger then h2 h2 than h3 etc this produces documents that make no sense are extremely device dependentent and whose usefulness is limited to the period during which that particular browser behaves in that particular way it produces documents that are confusing when viewed on other browsers and ironically even on the intended browser since readers are with most browsers free to set the display paramaters for each element to suit their own taste visual needs or hardware capabilities in other words this doesn t work previous page tutorial top tech guide next page walter henry stanford university libraries and academic information resources
