example 10 gaas mesfet gate simulation 1d gaas mesfet gate simulation 1d description this example simulates a simple 1d gaas mesfet structure underneath the gate this utilizes suprem iv gs's new true 1d mode first the 1d grid is set up and initialized with carbon as a background dopant beryllium and silicon are implanted into gaas note that silicon as an impurity is designated as isilicon the as implanted dopant concentration depth profiles are plotted in 1d in figure 1 next an anneal step is done using the fermi method and the diffused beryllium profile is then plotted in the same figure the hump in the beryllium profile at the beryllium silicon junction is due to the electric field effect on diffusion since the beryllium was implanted the implanted diffusivity numbers as opposed to the grown in numbers are used the input file for the simulation is in the examples exam10 directory in the file example10 in option quiet set echo mode one dim line x loc 0.0 spacing 0.01 tag top line x loc 1.0 spacing 0.01 line x loc 20 spacing 0.25 tag bottom region gaas xlo top xhi bottom boundary exposed xlo top xhi top boundary backside xlo bottom xhi bottom init carbon conc 1e15 implant beryllium dose 2e13 energy 100 pearson implant isilicon dose 5e13 energy 50 pearson beryllium gaas dip 0 2.1 e 8 dip e 1.74 beryllium gaas nitride seg 0 5 seg e 0 deposit nitride thick 3 select z log10 beryllium plot 1d x min 0 x ma 2 y mi 14 y max 20 line type 2 select z log10 isilicon plot 1d x min 0 x ma 2 y mi 14 y max 20 cle f axi f line type 3 select z log10 carbon plot 1d x min 0 x ma 2 y mi 14 y max 20 cle f axi f line type 4 method fermi init 1e 5 method full fac diffuse time 15 temp 800 argon select z log10 beryllium plot 1d x min 0 x ma 2 y mi 14 y max 20 cle f axi f line type 5 quit if you wish to change the beryllium diffusivity parameters you would uncomment the line beryllium gaas dip 0 2.1 e 8 dip e 1.74 and put in your own values
