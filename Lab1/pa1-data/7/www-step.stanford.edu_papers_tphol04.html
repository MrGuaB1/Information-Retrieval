zhang sipma manna term algebras with length function and bounded quantifier alternation term algebras with length function and bounded quantifier alternation ting zhang henny sipma zohar manna term algebras have wide applicability in computer science unfortunately the decision problem for term algebras has a nonelementary lower bound which makes the theory and any extension of it intractable in practice however it is often more appropriate to consider the bounded class in which formulae can have arbitrarily long sequences of quantifiers but the quantifier alternation depth is bounded in this paper we present new quantifier elimination procedures for the first order theory of term algebras and for its extension with integer arithmetic the elimination procedures deal with a block of quantifiers of the same type in one step we show that for the bounded class of at most k quantifier alternations regardless of the total number of quantifiers the complexity of our procedures is k fold exponential resp 2k fold exponential for the theory of term algebras resp for the extended theory with integers in the 17th internation conference on theorem proving in higher order logics tphols 04 lncs 3223 pp 321 336 springer verlag 2004 bibtex postscript pdf extended version 2004 springer verlag henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu last modified april 7 14 40 50 pdt 2005
