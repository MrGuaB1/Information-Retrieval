assignment 5 still life assignment 5 still life rahul rahul gupta 3 shadows requirement 3 the camera settings were aperture priority mode focal length 18mm f 3.5 exposure 1 15 iso 400 i chose aperture priority mode as i wanted the least possible dof and let the camera decide the exposure i set to a high iso as i needed to handhold the camera and with lower iso the exposre time was too much to avoid shake blur i used a white glitter paper as the background as the light passing through the bottles and the glass were more prominently visible and the sparkly effect seemed nice i used a spotlight blub placed on the left of the bottles and played with bottle placement and rotation to get the desired 3 color effect for the shot i was looking right down focusing on the small glasses base so that the top of the bottles would blur out i would have loved to capture the entire bottles but the light source had to be placed extremely close to the base of bottles and hence had to crop the image previous back to all photos next
