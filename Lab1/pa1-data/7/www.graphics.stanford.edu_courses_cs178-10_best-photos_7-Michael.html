assignment 7 night and color assignment 7 night and color michael michael santos this fulfills requirement 2 night scene of architecture this was taken at cincinnati's iconic fountain square i recognize that the requirement specified that no motion blur should be seen but i assume blur from running water doesn t count this place was extremely well lit i used an exposure time of 4 seconds and an f number of 18 trying to keep a high depth of field i cropped the picture in photoshop but otherwise this scene is unedited my favorite part of this photograph is how the streams of water seem to blur into streams of light due to the exposure time it makes it look quite heavenly previous back to all photos next
