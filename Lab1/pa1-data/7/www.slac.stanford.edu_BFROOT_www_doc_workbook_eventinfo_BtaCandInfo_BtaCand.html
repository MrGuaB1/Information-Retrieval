babar workbook btacandidates btacandidate information in babar code all particle candidates are stored as btacandidates as members of the btacandidate c++ class they automatically come with lots of physics information for example you can get the four momentum and charge of any btacandidate the following are some of the most useful kinematic and other variables for btacandidates for a complete list of quantities and functions available for btacandidates a good place to look is the btacandidate header file btacandidate hh btacandidate info begin with a pointer to a btacandidate btacandidate mybtacand quantity type description mybtacand charge int charge 1 0 1 of the candidate as determined by the direction of its curvature in the babar solenoid mybtacand energy double energy gev of the candidate in the lab frame for neutrals it is the uncalibrated energy deposited in the calorimeter for charged tracks it is the relativistic energy assuming the pion mass hypothesis if none has been assigned yet mybtacand p4 mybtacand p4 heppoint heplorentzvector 4 momentum of the candidate in the lab frame for neutrals as determined from the energy and mass for charged tracks as determined by the curvature of the track track based on hits in both the drift chamber and the svt mybtacand p4 x mybtacand p4 y mybtacand p4 z mybtacand p4 rho mybtacand p4 e double components of the 4 momentum of the candidate in the lab frame first three variables are px py pz rho is the the magnitude of the 3 momentum vector e is the energy component mybtacand p4 theta mybtacand p4 phi double angles for spherical coordinates mybtacand p4err mybtacand p4err heppoint bbrerror covariance note for neutrals you must use the method which takes a heppoint as its argument mybtacand p4wcov bbrlorentzvectorerr 4 momentum with errors mybtacand decayvtx btaabsvertex information on the decay vertex of this candidate mybtacand recotrk fitresult helix 0 covariance hepsymmatrix error matrix of the helix fit parameters mybtacand doca heppoint double doca of the track to a given point in 3d mybtacand docaxy heppoint double doca of the track to a given point in 2d mybtacand docaerr heppoint double error on doca of the track to a given point in 3d mybtacand docaxyerr heppoint double error on doca of the track to a given point in 2d mybtacand docaerr bbrpointerr double same as with heppoint but allowing error on the point with respect to which the doca is made mybtacand docaxyerr bbrpointerr double same as with heppoint but allowing error on the point with respect to which the doca is made mybtacand recoobject position heppoint heppoint the poca to the heppoint of the btacandidate add btaabsrecoobject xy as second argument if the poca must be in 2d mybtacand recoobject positionerr heppoint bbrpointerr error on the poca to the heppoint of the btacandidate add btaabsrecoobject xy as second argument if the poca must be in 2d mybtacand recoobject momentum heppoint hep3vector value of the btacandidate momentum after it has been swum to the poca of the heppoint add btaabsrecoobject xy as second argument if the poca must be in 2d in many cases this is the same as mybtacand momentum heppoint mybtacand recoobject momentumerr heppoint bbrvectorerr value of the btacandidate momentum error matrix after it has been swum to the poca of the heppoint add btaabsrecoobject xy as second argument if the poca must be in 2d you can also get detector level information about the btacandidates back
