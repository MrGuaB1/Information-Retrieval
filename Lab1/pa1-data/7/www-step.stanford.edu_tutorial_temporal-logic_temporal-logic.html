temporal logic temporal logic propositional temporal logic back to the tutorial pages linear time temporal logic temporal logic is a convenient formalism for specifying and verifying properties of reactive systems as first pointed out by pnueli in 1977 a formula of temporal logic describes the set of infinite sequences for which it is true also known as a temporal property a given system satisfies a property if all of its computations belong to this set a model of linear time temporal logic ltl is an infinite sequence of states where each point in time has a unique successor temporal formulas are evaluated over such a sequence of states together with an index i 0 1 2 of the i th state syntax and informal description besides the usual logical connectives temporal formulas can be composed using temporal operators we describe these briefly with p and q being sub formulas future temporal operators p henceforth p p eventually p p until q q holds some time in the future and p holds at least up to the first q p awaits q either p holds indefinitely or p until q p p holds at the next time instance past temporal operators p so far p p once p p since q q did hold some time in the past and p held at least down to the first q p backto q either p since q or p p p holds at the previous time instance and current time is not 0 p p holds at the previous time instance or the current time is 0 there is no previous time instance semantics a temporal logic formula p is satisfiable if there is a sequence of states s such that s 0 p it is valid if the negation is unsatisfiable a propositional temporal formula is a temporal formula where all atoms are propositional variables a propositional temporal formula therefore does not contain quantification and compound predicates last modified wed jul 1 10 01 34 pdt 1998
