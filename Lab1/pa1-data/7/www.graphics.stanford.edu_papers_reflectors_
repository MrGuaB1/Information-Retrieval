illumination from curved reflectors illumination from curved reflectors pat hanrahan and don mitchell computer graphics proc siggraph 1992 july 1992 abstract a technique is presented to compute the reflected illumination from curved mirror surfaces onto other surfaces in accordance with fermat's principle this is equivalent to finding extremal paths from the light source to the visible surface via the mirrors once pathways of illumination are found irradiance is computed from the gaussian curvature of the geometrical wavefront techniques from optics differential geometry and interval analysis are applied to solve these problems additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper without figures 66k plate 1 plate 2 plate 3 detail of plate 2 spot diagram of rays reflected off cuboid back up to papers index
