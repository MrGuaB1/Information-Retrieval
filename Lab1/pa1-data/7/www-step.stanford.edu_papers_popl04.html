sankaranarayanan sipma manna non linear loop invariant generation non linear loop invariant generation sriram sankaranarayanan henny sipma zohar manna we present a new technique for the generation of non linear algebraic invariants of a program our technique uses the theory of ideals over polynomial rings to reduce the non linear invariant generation problem to a numerical constraint solving problem so far the literature on invariant generation has been focussed on the construction of linear invariants for linear programs consequently there has been little progress toward non linear invariant generation in this paper we demonstrate a technique that encodes the conditions for a given template assertion being an invariant into a set of constraints such that all the solutions to these constraints correspond to non linear algebraic loop invariants of the program we discuss some trade offs between the completeness of the technique and the tractability of the constraint solving problem generated the application of the technique is demonstrated on a few examples in principles of programming languages popl acm 2004 postscript pdf 2004 acm henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu last modified thu jan 12 14 40 50 pdt 2004
