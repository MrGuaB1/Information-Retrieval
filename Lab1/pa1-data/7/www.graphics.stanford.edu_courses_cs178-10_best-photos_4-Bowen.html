assignment 4 architecture and interiors assignment 4 architecture and interiors bowen bowen meng frame shot for the frame requirement i tried several spots to compose the image i tried to shoot through windows steel bars and arc doors later on when i was searching in the main quad i found this nature plant made frame for the photo this frame was made of leaves and tiny flowers crouching over it through it the hoover tower and conner of the main quad in the scene this natural frame makes the photo more tempting and vivid than some solid frame i took this photo in the middle of the day and the sunshine is bright but in the shade under this plant door it becomes much darker than outside so i choose iso to be 400 and exposure time to be 1 800 sec i use a small aperture size and focus of the foreground of the scene since the depth of field is high so everything in the photo is in clear requirement 3 previous back to all photos next
