correlations between ftp throughput hops & packet loss correlations between ftp throughput hops & packet loss in order to get some idea of how ftp throughput rates kb sec correlate with ping response time and packet loss and against the number of hops as measured by traceroute we have measured these metrics between slac and several slac collaborator nodes we then plot the ftp throughput versus hop count and versus ping packet loss and versus ping response time the results are shown below it can be seen that there are strong correlations with response time and packet loss the correlation with hop count is less pronounced feedback owner les cottrell
