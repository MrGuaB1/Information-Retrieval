geant4 physics lists geant4 physics lists last modified update new simple and fast list for getting started with geant4 space sciences list updated from glast physics list introduction in the development of a geant4 based application it is the user's responsibility to decide which physics processes are required and then to include them in the physics list a description of geant4 physics lists and their use along with simple and detailed examples can be found in the geant4 application developer's guide in realistic applications the physics list can become long and involved also the large number of physics processes available can make the choice difficult for this reason the geant4 group at slac has developed and supports a number of physics lists which can be copied by users and integrated into their applications each physics list has been specialized for a given area of application physics list support consists of development of prototype physics lists testing based on simple examples updating the lists as new geant4 releases become available and validation against experimental data available physics lists current physics lists include those developed to support experiments based at least in part at slac these are vertex tracker calorimeter for b physics babar space sciences and astrophysics applications high energy tracker calorimeter for colliders ilc space electronics applications physics list simple and fast physics list for getting started general physics list with model selection dennis wright
