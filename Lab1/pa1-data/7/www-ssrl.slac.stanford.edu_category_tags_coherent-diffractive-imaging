coherent diffractive imaging stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource an office of science user facility home coherent diffractive imaging differential holography differential encoding brings higher resolution to x ray lensless holography 2010 sharpening the corners for higher resolution read more differential holography obtaining higher resolution x ray microscopy images depends on reference shape posted 2010 coherent diffractive imaging cdi is an x ray microscopy technique that takes advantage of the coherence property of modern x ray sources its resolution is in principle only limited to the wavelength of the x rays being used 1 instead of using imaging optics such as lenses to form a magnified image cdi tries to interpret the recorded coherent diffraction pattern and to obtain a numerical image reconstruction of the scattering object fourier transform holography is a particularly straight forward method for generating coherent diffraction patterns that are easy to interpret 2 by introducing a nanoscale reference scatterer next to the object of interest and measure the x ray interference pattern an image reconstruction can be directly obtained by simply fourier transforming the measured diffraction intensity distribution read more syndicate content the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource is a directorate of slac national accelerator laboratory which is operated by stanford university for the department of energy other news sources slac today ssrl headlines symmetry magazine lightsources org interactions org ilc newsline spires slac national accelerator laboratory slac national accelerator laboratory menlo park ca operated by stanford university for the us department of energy office of science content owner cathy knotts privacy notice security notice and terms of use doe stanford university
