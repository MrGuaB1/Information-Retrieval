lattice qcd workshop 2006 slac saturday september 16 2006 purpose with the continuing accumulation of data at the b factories many critical analyses are becoming limited by theoretical uncertainties at the same time lattice qcd is making significant progress in calculating key hadronic parameters that will be needed to push the measurement errors down even further the intent of this workshop is to have an informal meeting focusing on current physics issues in this area now is an ideal time to meet with our lattice friends and increase the positive feedback between theory and experiment this workshop will focus on the following topics form factors in semileptonic b and d meson decays leptonic decays radiative decays spectroscopy hybrid models and ut fits talks will be posted to the babar internal web while theoretical talks will be publicly available the experimental talks if they contain not yet preliminary results will be restricted to babar members only program the workshop is scheduled for september 16 2006 after the babar collaboration meeting and will start at 9 am and end around 7 pm the same day there will be a number of short overview talks on the relevant experimental and theoretical topics with adequate time for discussion here you can find the tentative agenda registration there will be a registration fee of $7 to be paid by cash at the workshop to cover lunch and breaks register for the lattice workshop participant list other information when september 16 2006 9 am to 7 pm where slac redwood rooms rob bldg 48 babar contacts jochen dingfelder antimo palano achille stocchi theory contacts thomas blum paul mackenzie junko shigemitsu accomodations slac guest house or hotels near slac meals we will provide lunch and refreshments during the breaks a no host dinner will be arranged for saturday evening contributions instructions for speakers can be found here conference call call in no 1 510 665 5437 meeting id 9 am 1 pm 1104 2 pm 7 pm 1105 a list of questions relevant to the topics discussed in this workshop can be found here a list of reference material relevant to this workshop for preparatory reading can be found here last modified sep 4 2006 by jochen dingfelder
