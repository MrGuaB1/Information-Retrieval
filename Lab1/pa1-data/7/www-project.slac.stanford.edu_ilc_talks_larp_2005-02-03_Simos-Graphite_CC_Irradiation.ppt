mercury target pressure shock uniform deposition case n simos larp 02 03 05 material irradiation studies for high intensity proton beam targets and collimators bnl ags blip hot cell facility nicholas simos bnl n simos larp 02 03 05 scope assess the effects of proton irradiation on material properties that are key in the design and operation of high power targets and collimators experiment is focused on effects of protons on graphite is proton irradiation any different than neutron irradiation are properties of graphite such as conductivity change as drastically as with neutrons what are the effects of the surrounding ambient air vacuum inert gases is there an optimal operational temperature range is carbon carbon the alternative to graphite how about these new smart materials gum metal albemet etc n simos larp 02 03 05 why should we be worried reactor experience on graphites and cc composites under neutron irradiation paints a bleak picture the key property that we rely on in the collimator diffusivity and or conductivity to transport the beam deposited load can diminish dramatically workable scenarios that so far dictate the design already operate close to the limits with unaffected properties observe in the following figures the dramatic effects of irradiation on these materials n simos larp 02 03 05 n simos larp 02 03 05 n simos larp 02 03 05 n simos larp 02 03 05 how do we make sure the collimator design is based on best possible knowledge of material behavior either the design adopts the worst case scenario based on existing results from neutron irradiation ie reduce diffusivity by a factor of 8 or 9 in which case it will not make it or experiment with the material under conditions that are close to what the real thing will experience no arm waving can work in this case are we doing anything about it the answer is yes but there is need for a push to get us to the next level n simos larp 02 03 05 test 1 shock test using 24 cev protons graphite vs carbon carbon n simos larp 02 03 05 atj graphite vs carbon carbon composite 1sr indicator cc is the way to go if we care to absorb shock do things hold true after irradiation n simos larp 02 03 05 previous studies focused on super invar n simos larp 02 03 05 some alloys change drastically and some don t n simos larp 02 03 05 irradiation studies & post irradiation studies current material study matrix carbon carbon composite toyota gum metal graphite ig 43 albemet beryllium ti alloy 6al 4v vascomax nickel plated alum n simos larp 02 03 05 measuring irradiation effects on material thermal expansion mechanical properties thermal conductivity diffusivity and thermal shock irradiation studies & post irradiation studies on going in hot cell facility n simos larp 02 03 05 irradiation studies & post irradiation studies material irradiation completed in april 2004 n simos larp 02 03 05 n simos larp 02 03 05 n simos larp 02 03 05 3 d fine weaved carbon carbon composite under study temp elongation 23 o c 0 200 o c 0.023 400 o c 0.028 600 o c 0.020 800 o c 0 1000 o c 0.040 1200 o c 0.084 1600 o c 0.190 2000 o c 0.310 2300 o c 0.405 n simos larp 02 03 05 gum metal toyota ti alloy n simos larp 02 03 05 n simos larp 02 03 05 where are we and what is needed to complete most mechanical testing completed currently evaluating the ig graphite to be followed by carbon carbon all other materials done data are still in raw form during next larp video i will have a complete presentation graphite and cc composite thermal expansion swelling are in progress completed evaluation at 300 deg c and in air next phase will be at higher temperatures gradually creeping to 1100 c and with a vacuum and b helium preliminary tests of cc up to 600 c indicated that there is either sublimation or oxidation taking place when in air workable scenarios that so far dictate the design already operate close to the limits with unaffected properties n simos larp 02 03 05 what is needed to complete scrutinize graphite & cc composite at higher temperatures and different environments biggest problem is the unavailability of funds to use the hot cell facility it cost me $850 day to operate in one cell following thermal expansion swelling changes in graphite & cc perform the most important evaluation diffusivity conductivity changes in these materials availability of funds is the sticking problem again enhance the apparatus to allow for these measurements in the hot cell pay for the extended use of the hot cell facility off beam shock resilience of graphite cc high power laser system ready to go need of funding for a post doc who is joining me in march
