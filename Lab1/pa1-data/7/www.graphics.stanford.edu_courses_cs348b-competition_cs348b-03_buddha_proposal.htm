final project final project cs348b computer graphics image synthesis techniques huamin wang whmin stanford edu similar images i d like to reproduce motivation see how to simulate the appearance of marble or jade using subsurface scattering possible methods are hanrahan and krueger's siggraph 93 paper that applying subsurface scattering to plants and faces but in the end the model it uses a brdf to represent model which cannot account for the light transport effect between different points here i am trying to use photon maps to represent the incident flux then use the diffuse approximation to evaluate the bssrdf by sampling all photons the method is proposed in henrik w jensen juan buhler proc of siggraph 2002 plan since i have not time to build a model by myself i will use stanford bunny or happy buddha the scene is rendered using subsurface scattering also add environment mapping to make it more realistic if time permits i d like to add some more fancy effects like caustics on the model put it into the water reference a rapid hierarchical rendering technique for translucent materials henrik w jensen juan buhler proc of siggraph 2002 reflection from layered surfaces due to subsurface scattering hanrahan p and drueger w proc of siggraph 1993 monte carlo evaluation of non linear scattering equations for subsurface reflection pharr m and hanrahan p proc of siggraph 2000
