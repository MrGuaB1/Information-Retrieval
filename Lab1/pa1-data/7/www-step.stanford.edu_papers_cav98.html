colon uribe generating finite state abstractions of reactive systems using decision procedures generating finite state abstractions of reactive systems using decision procedures michael colon tomas uribe we present an algorithm that uses decision procedures to generate finite state abstractions of possibly infinite state systems the algorithm compositionally abstracts the transitions of the system relative to a given fixed set of assertions thus the number of validity checks is proportional to the size of the system description rather than the size of the abstract state space the generated abstractions are weakly preserving for universal ctl temporal properties we describe several applications of the algorithm implemented using the decision procedures of the stanford temporal prover step appeared in international conference on computer aided verification cav 98 pp 293 304 vol 1427 of lncs springer verlag june july 1998 postscript pdf 1998 springer verlag last modified wed may 5 14 38 50 pdt 1999
