an environment for merging and testing large ontologies an environment for merging and testing large ontologies knowledge systems laboratory stanford university abstract an environment for merging and testing large ontologies large scale ontologies are becoming an essential component of many applications including standard search such as yahoo and lycos e commerce such as amazon and ebay configuration such as dell and pc order and government intelligence such as darpa's high performance knowledge base hpkb program the ontologies are becoming so large that it is not uncommon for distributed teams of people with broad ranges of training to be in charge of the ontology development design and maintenance standard ontologies such as un spsc are emerging as well which need to be integrated into large application ontologies sometimes by people who do not have much training in knowledge representation this process has generated needs for tools that support broad ranges of users in 1 merging of ontological terms from varied sources 2 diagnosis of coverage and correctness of ontologies 3 maintaining ontologies over time in this paper we present a new merging and diagnostic ontology environment tool called chimaera which was developed to address these issues in the context of hpkb we also report on some initial tests of its effectiveness in merging tasks deborah l mcguinness richard fikes james rice and steve wilder an environment for merging and testing large ontologies in proceedings of the seventh international conference on principles of knowledge representation and reasoning kr2000 breckenridge colorado usa 12 15 april 2000 return to selected papers of deborah l mcguinness home people software and network services projects contact technical reports links copyright 1999 stanford university all rights reserved
