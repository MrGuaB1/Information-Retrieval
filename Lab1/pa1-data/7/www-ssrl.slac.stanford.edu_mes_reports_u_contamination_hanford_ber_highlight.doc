5 synchrotron based studies of uranium speciation in contaminated sediments and related model system jeffrey g catalano and gordon e brown jr stanford university and ssrl john m zachara and steven heald pacific northwest national laboratory ober emsp brown evaluation of the human health risks of widespread uranium contamination of soils sediments and groundwater requires an understanding of the geochemical processes that control the fate and transport of uranium in such systems determining the speciation of uranium at the source of contamination as well as the processes affecting transport especially adsorption to mineral surfaces is essential in order to develop appropriate predictive transport models we have employed synchrotron based x ray spectroscopic and diffraction methods to study uranium speciation in contaminated vadose zone sediments from the hanford site in washington state figure 1 a and have also applied these methods to study uranyl adsorption onto mineral surfaces in model systems in the study of contaminated sediments from the hanford site catalano et al 2004a ul iii exafs spectroscopy revealed that uranium occurred primarily in the form of au ranophane group mineral as the local atomic environment of uranium is similar in all members of this group exafs could not identify the specific phase present figure 1 c complementary xrd measurements identified only sodium boltwoodite na uo 2 sio 3 oh 1.5 h 2 o which has effectively sequestered uranium in these sediments under the current geochemical and hydrologic conditions figure 1 b in a related study we also carried out detaile d ul iii exafs studies of a number of uranyl containing crystalline solids for use as model compounds in the analysis of contaminated hanford sa mples catalano and brown 2004 two additional studies were conducted to evaluate how adsorption processes influence uranium partitioning to solids from contaminated waters in the first study u vi adsorption onto montmorillonite as a function of ph ionic strength and co 2 content was examined using exafs spectro scopy catalano and brown 2004 at low ionic strength outer sphere adsorption of u vi via cation exchange was found to be more important than predicted by previous surface complexation models u vi adsorbs to edge sites as inner sphere uranyl carbonato ternary complexes in the presence of atmospheric co 2 concentrations u vi binds preferentially to fe o oh 6 edge sites over al o oh 6 sites in both the presence and absence of co 2 past surface complexation models should be modified to account for these findings and future studies of u vi transport in the environment should consider how uranium retardation will be affected by changes in ph and ionic strength in the second study ctr diffraction and gi exafs spectroscopy were used to investigate u vi adsorption onto al 2 o 3 and fe 2 o 3 1 102 surfaces at ph 5 7 i 0.1 m catalano et al 2004b u vi in the form of uranyl carbonato ternary complexes adsorbed in a monodentate fashion on al 2 o 3 1 102 and in a bidentate fashion on fe 2 o 3 1 102 the fe 2 o 3 1 102 surface was found to have a higher affinity for u vi adsorption under these solution conditions the adsorption geometries observed in this study differed from those typically found on powdered substrates using exafs spectroscopy under the same conditions references jg catalano sm heald jm zachara and ge brown jr x ray spectroscopic and diffraction study of uranium speciation in contaminated vadose zone sediments from the hanford site washington st ate usa environ sci technol 38 10 2822 2828 2004a jg catalano tp trainor pj eng ga waychunas and ge brown jr ctr diffraction and grazing incidence xafs study of u vi adsorption to al 2 o 3 and fe 2 o 3 1 102 surfaces geochim cosmochim acta 2004b submitted jg catalano and ge brown jr uranyl adsorption on montmorillonite evaluation of binding sites and carbonate complexation geochim cosmochim acta 2004 submitted
