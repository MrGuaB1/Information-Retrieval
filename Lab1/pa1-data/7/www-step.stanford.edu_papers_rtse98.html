manna colon finkbeiner sipma uribe abstraction and modular verification of infinite state reactive systems abstraction and modular verification of infinite state reactive systems zohar manna michael colon bernd finkbeiner zohar manna henny sipma tomas uribe we review a number of temporal verification techniques for reactive systems using modularity and abstraction their use allows the verification of larger systems and the incremental verification of systems as they are developed and refined in particular we show how deductive verification tools and the combination of finite state model checking and abstraction allow the verification of infinite state systems featuring data types commonly used in software specifications including real time and hybrid systems appeared in requirements targeting software and systems engineering rtse lncs 1526 springer verlag pp 273 292 1998 postscript pdf 1998 springer verlag henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu last modified thu mar 29 10 39 10 pst 2001
