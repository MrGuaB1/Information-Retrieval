tunneling techniques tunneling techniques there is one work where influence of tunneling technique tunnel boring machine versus blasting was investigated and it was suggested that blasting result in higher amplitudes of slow diffusive motion see takeda99 and references therein another in this case theoretical investigation suggested that for a tunnel located withing 1 2 of its diameter from the ground surface there should be an amplification due to interference of waves of fast ground motion factor of 2 3 at some frequencies see manoogian98 for more details
