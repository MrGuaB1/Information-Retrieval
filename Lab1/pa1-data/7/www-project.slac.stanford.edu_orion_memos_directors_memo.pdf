director's memorandum page 1 stanford linear accelerator center operated for the us department of energy by stanford university director's memorandum to distribution july 15 2000 from jonathan dorfan subject the orion facility advanced accelerator r&d remains a critically important part of our slac mission innovation in accelerator technology has been one of the hallmarks of the slac program creating new and effective directions for the world program in accelerator based science if high energy physics is to continue to flourish well into the 21st century new ideas and technologies are needed but we cannot do it all on our own a comprehensive program of advanced accelerator r&d requires engagement from the university and user community accordingly we have taken the decision to build a facility with a programmatic approach to experiments in advanced accelerator r&d the facility called orion see www slac stanford edu conf orion orion pdf will use the nlcta as its base adding two analyzing stations a laser station for polarized gun studies and second laser station for plasma beam interactions a key element for the orion program is that it be a user driven facility experiments using orion will be proposed for peer review in much the same way as for spear or end station a to test the desirability of such a facility a workshop was convened in february 2000 it was clear from the workshop that there is considerable user interest and a substantial list of potential experiments moving forward on orion was endorsed by the scientific policy committee at its recent meeting the next step is to design and build the facility which will cost about $4 5m the ground rules for the building phase are that the implementation funds must be raised outside of the present slac budget to reduce costs we will seek opportunities for the reuse of existing equipment both at slac and other institutions bob siemann will be in charge of building orion orion will be treated as a project under the auspices of the technical division with ewan paterson as the responsible associate director we will appoint a planning and advisory group composed mainly of non slac people who will assist and advise the project office as discussed below with the implementation and funding plan in order to reach such a plan some technical support is needed accordingly bob will establish a project planning office comprising himself a project page 2 stanford linear accelerator center operated for the us department of energy by stanford university engineer and a lead physicist further enhancement of the project office or its scope require ewan's concurrence the implementation plan must take into account the use of the nlcta for nlc development as part of establishing the implementation plan the project office will seek unused or poorly utilized equipment at slac there exist stockpiles of such equipment around the site in addition some equipment is tied to existing facilities which are either not currently used eg the slc final focus or are infrequently used and may well provide the opportunity for considerably more effective utilization identification and reassignment of such equipment must be done with care and consultation in some cases there are competing needs for the same equipment in such cases it is unreasonable to expect the proponents to agree on who should benefit we need a process that will do two things 1 take inventory of under utilized equipment and 2 will arbitrate between competing potential users of the equipment i will soon set up a process to facilitate these two goals distribution senior management forum burton richter
