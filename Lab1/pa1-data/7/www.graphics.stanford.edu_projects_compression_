compression of synthetic images compression of synthetic images although the digital convergence of computers and video is well underway the convergence of computer graphics and video technology has only begun a key problem in this area is developing efficient ways to compress the data used in graphics algorithms geometric models synthetic images textures and volumes among the questions we are addressing in this research are can a rendering engine provide hints to a compression engine examples might include motion hints quantization hints importance hints or real time constraints can a rendering engine perform compression or decompression more specifically can we render directly from compressed textures or volumes or can we render directly to compressed image formats what compression algorithms can we invent that are specialized for compressing geometry and synthetic images examples might include specialized basis functions for compressing smoothly shaded images and hybrids of geometry based and image based compression this project is currently inactive people maneesh agrawala maneesh pepper stanford edu andrew beers beers cs stanford edu navin chaddha marc levoy recent papers in this area polygon assisted jpeg and mpeg compression of synthetic images marc levoy proc siggraph 95 model based motion estimation for synthetic animations maneesh agrawala andrew beers and navin chaddha proc acm multimedia 95 rendering from compressed textures andrew beers maneesh agrawala and navin chaddha proc siggraph 96 if images on this page look dark to you see our note about gamma correction a list of technical papers with abstracts and pointers to additional information is also available or you can return to the research projects page or our home page copyright 1995 marc levoy last update february 19 2006 09 37 59 pm
