observational evidence for two cosmological predictions made by bit string physics page 1 slac pub 8779 march 2001 observational evidence for two cosmological predictions made by bit string physics h pierre noyes stanford linear accelerator center stanford university stanford ca 94309 abstract a decade ago bit string physics predicted that the baryon photon ratio at the time of nucleogenesis  1 2564 and that the dark matter baryonic matter ratio dm b 12.7 accepting that the normalized hubble constant is constrained observationally to lie in the range 0.6 h0 0.8 this translates into a prediction that 0.325 m 0.183 this and a prediction by ed jones using a model independent argument and ideas with which bit string physics is not inconsistent that the cosmological constant  0.6 0.1 are in reasonable agreement with recent cosmo logical observations including the boomerang data submitted to new astronomy work supported by department of energy contract de ac03 76sf00515
