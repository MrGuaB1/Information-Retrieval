the stanford kiwi project testbed the gates testbed our testbed consists of 12 ieee 802.11 b g access points aps distributed across a 50mx24m approx 164x79ft area in the fourth floor of the gates building at stanford university all aps are configured to act as sensors and report various frame statistics to a central server called a wireless appliance or wa these aps are always in passive mode ie they generate no traffic and therefore do not interfere with the currently deployed 802.11 infrastructure we have been building this testbed to better evaluate our location based services specially our localization and range based authentication mechanisms access points scan multiple 802.11 channels and report signal strength measurements aka rssi levels back to the wa which periodically estimates the physical location of each known mobile device note for obvious privacy reasons at this moment we are only processing traffic generated by mobile devices belonging to members of our research project no data is kept about other mobile devices and their physical locations are never estimated by the system more about the testbed including access point layout and datasets will be made available soon you can get more information about the hardware we are using in our hardware page we would specially like to thank our building staff including miles davis tom dienstbier christine fiksdal and hector gamez for all the help provided
