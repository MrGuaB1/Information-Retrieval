spear3 a brighter source at ssrl 500 ma news last update july 19 2005 spear3 2004 closeout report spear3 commissioning update first spear3 beam into ssrl beam line hutch a major milestone for the spear3 commissioning occurred at 17 56 on monday march 8 2004 when the first spear3 synchrotron light was observed on a monitor located inside bl9 3's monochromator housing fig 1 this was followed by threading the beam through the focusing optics to deliver beam inside the experimental hutch enclosure some 20 mins later the in hutch picture of the beam fig 2 shows banding which is consistent with the effect of the separated pole pairs in the wiggler viewed at the 5 mrad off axis observation angle of bl9 3 this effect could not be seen with the old spear2 ring as its source size was so big that the radiation from each pole pair could not be resolved thus even in this first photo the effect of the reduced source size on spear3 is immediately seen fig 2 fig 1 a video which chronicles the installation activities is available at http www ssrl slac stanford edu movies spear3 oct 03 mpg february 2004 spear3 commissioning continues smoothly january 22 2004 stored current in spear3 reached 100 ma at 10 pm january 20 2004 verification of integrity of the orbit interlock january 1 2004 excellent commissioning progress over the holiday break december 15 2003 first accumulated beam in spear3 december 12 2003 first electrons circulate in spear3 spear3 overview ssrl entered a new era of synchrotron radiation experimentation with the completion of the spear 3 upgrade project in 2008 the spear 3 storage ring with parameters summarized in table 1 produces beams having one to two orders of magnitude higher brightness and flux density than the old spear 2 ring table 2 accommodates several new high performance insertion devices and beam lines and is capable of top off operation by virtue of its improved at energy injection system brightness for new undulators exceeds 10 18 at 5 kev the 4 year 58 m upgrade project is administered by the doe with 50 joint funding from nih the project completely replaced the spear vacuum chamber magnets support rafts rf power supplies cable plant and shielding tunnel floor in a 7 month shutdown period that began march 31 2003 480 tons of spear 2 magnet girders vacuum chambers power supplies and most cables and controls were removed from the spear site shielding utilities and other ancillary systems were modified a new cable plant was installed in trays outside the tunnel new power supplies were installed in a refurbished building a new concrete floor was poured and mounting plates for spear 3 magnet and vacuum chamber support girders were installed and aligned pre assembled girders were installed in the second week of august followed by straight section vacuum chamber mode damped rf cavity insertion device and beam line front end component installation in september and early october the vacuum system was pumped down cable and utility connections completed and the ring aligned in october system testing took place in november and beam commissioning is now in progress beam was returned to users in march of 2004 spear3 will operate at 100 ma until all beam line optical components are upgraded radiation shielding is added and approved is received for higher current operation the accelerator physics and engineering groups will fully utilize ap time characterize and optimize ring lattice and beam parameters develop the fast orbit feedback system having a 4 khz orbit acquisition rate and to ascertain beam stability issues that might be encountered at higher currents spear3 2004 closeout report spear3 monthly progress reports august 2003 july 2003 june 2003 may 2003 april 2003 spear3 quarterly reports january through march 2003 october through december 2002 july through september 2002 january through march 2002 october through december 2001 july through september 2001 april through june 2001 january through march 2001 october through december 2000 july through september 2000 april through june 2000 spear 3 design report cdr ssrl slac stanford university ssrl computing slac computing last updated apr 05 2005 15 35 a mueller
