assignment 1 bad photos assignment 1 bad photos kate kate swanson this photo fulfills requirement 4 in easter spirit this scene is a back lit arrangement of easter chicks on a dark green book i used the the shade setting for white balance for this scene even though it was brightly lit to give a yellow tone to the image this is most apparent in the green book originally a dark green rgb 50 50 30 to a light yellow green rbg 130 70 0 the shadows on the front of the chicks also lost their grayish tone and became a warm orange overall the change in white balance gives the photo a warm cohesive feel more like the chicks are a community than the original image which highlighted the individuality of the subject previous back to all photos next
