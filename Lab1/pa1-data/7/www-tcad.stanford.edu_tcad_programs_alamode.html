overview of alamode alamode alamode a layered model development environment is a partial differential equation solver targeted at solving systems of pdes arising from models for impurity redistribution in semiconductors during thermal processing it allows user level specification of an arbitrary system of pdes consisting of diffusive advective and reactive terms it discretizes and solves the equations using a nonlinear semidiscrete fem approach and currently uses stanford suprem structure files for mesh input and output the next release of alamode will be driven by a portable equation description front end for an overview of the description language see the white paper html postscript pdf unfortunately this project was cancelled due to lack of funding the 97.08 19 release is available if you are running an earlier release please upgrade a set of example scripts is available for more information about alamode documentation for release 97.08 19 hypertext and postscript sisdep 95 paper binary distributions are available for the following systems sun sparc running solaris 2.5 and above hp 9000 7xx aka pa 1.1 running hp ux 10.01 and above dec alpha running osf1 3.2 and above ibm rs 6000 running aix 3.2 5 may also run on 4 x not current you are required to register with us in order to get access to a binary distribution alamode gloworm stanford edu last modified wed apr 4 10 00 07 pdt 2001
