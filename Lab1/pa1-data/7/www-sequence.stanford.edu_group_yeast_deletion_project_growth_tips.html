tips for growing yeast cells to the right density in the right time first several overnight growth curves are generated and the log phase doubling time for the incubator and strain are calculated using the following formula time final time initial in hours 1.44 ln od final od initial where time final time initial is the number of hours between t 0 and t n time points and od final and od initial are od 600 at t 0 and t n time points respectively this number should be something like 1.45 hours 1 hour 25 minutes at 30 c the linear range for some spectrophotometers is between 05 and 7 at the 600 nm wavelength so dilutions may be essential for obtaining good readings always mix your culture well before withdrawing a sample as well then the number of mls of a log phase culture of od600 x required to obtain a culture of volume v with an od 600 of y at time t hours later can be calculated from v y x 2 t dt of mls to add where y is the target od 600 x is the current od 600 t is the number of hours of growth v is the culture volume in mls dt is the doubling time in hours about 1.45 for our incubator so if your current culture has an od 600 of 10 and your 100 ml overnight culture should have an od 600 of 1.0 15 hours later then you would add 2.4 l deletion home page faqs strains publicly available protocols &technical information references useful sites & links
