xas catches the chemical form of mercury in fish view large image contact info friday 29 august 2003 x ray absorption spectroscopy catches the chemical form of mercury in fish ssrl scientists reveal new findings in science article the presence of methyl mercury in fish is well known but until now the detailed chemical identity of the mercury has remained a mystery in an x ray absorption spectroscopy study published in the august 29 issue of science science 301 2003 1203 science now murky picture on fish mercury ssrl scientists report that the chemical form of mercury involves a sulfur atom most likely in a so called aliphatic form the study presents significant new knowledge because the toxic properties of mercury or any element are critically dependent upon its chemical form and represents an important milestone in developing an understanding of how harmful mercury in fish might actually be the study was carried out by ssrl staff scientists ingrid pickering and graham george and postdoctoral fellow hugh harris using ssrl's structural molecular biology beam line 9 3 the very high flux excellent beam stability and state of the art detector technology allowed the team to measure samples of fish containing micromolar levels of mercury much lower than had previously been possible funding for this research was provided by the us department of energy office of biological and environmental research and by the nih national center for research resources biomedical technology program note ingrid pickering and graham george g george stanford edu have recently relocated to the university of saskatchewan and hugh harris to the university of sydney relevant urls ssrl home page http www ssrl slac stanford edu slac home page http www slac stanford edu stanford home page http www stanford edu
