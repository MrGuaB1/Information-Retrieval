space sciences physics list space sciences physics list last modified description the space sciences list contains the physics processes both electromagnetic and hadronic required to simulate space sciences applications including astrophysics satellites a detailed description of the space sciences physics list is provided along with links to the source code test modules not yet implemented several modules are provided as regression tests in order to compare physics results from release to release of geant4 these modules are based on simplified detector geometries test1 test2 validation not yet implemented validation tests are provided to compare physics results from experiments and test beams these are based on realistic detector geometries for each test a set of comparison plots are maintained test1 test2 tatsumi koi
