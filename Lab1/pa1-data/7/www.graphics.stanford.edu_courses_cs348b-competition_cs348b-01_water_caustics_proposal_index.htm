cs348b final project mike madison and nader zaki photos movies caustics1 mpg water caustics duck mpg a duck trying to get food from passers by using its cuteness project description objective render water caustics and maybe a water fountain and if we get really ambitious we may add particle interaction with splash we still don t know about the duck why it looks cool for example in the first image one of the coins appears overly bent due to light interaction with the water surface the human eye might sometimes miss these effects in their fullest because the water surface is moving relatively fast in fact this effect was not captured on purpose but instead recognized after reviewing the video at a slower frame rate challenges appropriate surface generation to achieve realistic looking caustics given the environment tentative approach we will use henrik jensen's photon mapping approach apropos the surface of the water generate the surface and normals procedurally project break down 1 photon mapping pass one sending out rays from the light backwards ray tracing building up the photon map using a kw tree one for caustics and another for general surfaces figuring out where to send the rays intelligent sampling 2 photon mapping pass two incorporate photon map lookup into normal raytracing use appropriate interpolation scheme when using photon map information 3 merging pass one and pass two 4 modelling the water surface write a script that generates a rib file of water with sinusoidal perturbation 5 modelling the environment the ground under the water maybe add some interesting tidbits such as plants fish dirt etc 6 procedural noise optional generate a noisy underwater ground surface 7 splash optional particle interaction chaos effects bubbles michael 2 3 4 5 nader 1 3 6 7
