fluorescence home up feedback contents please note wafer level txrf measurements are no longer available details on txrf home page home up x ray fluorescence is a process that occurs to relax an excited atom without a core electron as shown in the figure below an incident x ray photon with sufficient energy can ionize a core electron naturally any number of core electrons can be ionized from the numerous quantum electronic states that exist once the absorptive process has completed the atom then exists in an unstable configuration it can relax through auger electron emission or through the process of fluorescence in the auger process a higher energy electron decays to the state of the original core electron with the excess energy causing a less tightly bound electron to be emitted for the fluorescence process a decay from a higher electron shell emits an x ray with corresponding energy difference these processes are shown schematically below it should be noted that each of these decay mechanisms compete with each other and that the process of fluorescence dominates for high z elements while auger electron emission is more probable for low z elements send mail to pianetta stanford edu with questions or comments about this web site last modified january 26 2007
