the landau distribution page 1 the landau distribution we calibrate single crystals in the emc by dividing measured energy by predicted energy the latter comes from the charged track swimmer and gets its energy loss estimates from the bethe block formula for a muon in csi points on the bethe block curve correspond to the mean of a landau distribution well not quite in fact the landau distribution has no mean in practice we truncate the distribution at some arbitrarily high energy and take the mean from this the result of all this is that our energy ratio plot is a landau divided by the mean of a landau and since the landau distribution is skew with a large tail to high energies then the energy ratio plot is expected to peak somewhere below 1 our calibration procedure is to provide a constant necessary to shift this peak to one and then apply this constant to all measured energies in that crystal page 2 what we would really like to do is calibrate by shifting the mean of the energy ratio plot to 1 this is unreliable how do you choose the cut off how exactly is the width of the peak affected by background and noise for now calibrating to the peak is the only reliable thing we can do the upshot of this is that we need a handle on the systematic introduced by taking peak mean instead of peak peak look at analytic form of landau distribution page 3 so it looks as though the shift between mean and peak is pretty much constant over our region of interest in momentum 1 10gev and scales linearly with pathlength the discrepancy appears to be about 0.37 mev cm mips deposit 5.6 mev cm in csi so this represents a 6 7 shift in predicted energy from the peak
