recent results from cleo page 1 recent results from cleo jon j thaler university of illinois urbana il 61801 representing the cleo collaboration abstract i present a selection of recent cleo results this talk covers mostly b physics with one tau result and one charm result i do not intend to be comprehensive all cleo papers are available on the web at http www lns cornell edu public clns cleo html supported by doe grant doe fg02 91er 406677 page 2 in this talk i will discuss four b physics topics and two others the semileptonic branching ratio and the charm deficit hadronic decays and tests of factorization rare hadronic decays and cp engineering measurement of v cb using b dl a precision measurement of the  michel parameters the possible observation of cs annihilation in hadronic d s decay one theme that will run throughout is the need in an era of 10 5 branching fraction sensitivity and 1 accuracy for redundancy and control over systematic error b semileptonic decay and the charm deficit do we understand the gross features of b decay the answer to this question is important for two reasons first new physics may lurk in small discrepancies second b decays form the primary background to rare b processes and an accurate understanding of backgrounds will be important to the success of experiments at the upcoming b factories compare measurements of the semileptonic branching fraction at lep with those at the  4s see figure 1 and with theory one naively expects the lep result to be 0.96 of the 4s result because lep measures an inclusive rate which is pulled down by the short  b lifetime in fact the ratio of results is 1.09 0.042 about 2 high the lep n c measurement
