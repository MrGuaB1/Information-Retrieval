new page 1 experimental constraints on the higgs mass established measurements of the z boson mass at lep and the top quark mass at the tevatron now allow predictions of the higgs mass from precise measurements of the weak mixing angle the w mass and the z width higgs mass plot by technique the yellow region is excluded by direct searches for the higgs by the lep experiments the curves represent probability distributions for what the higgs mass should be based on several different experimental techniques the minimum of the curves is the most likely higgs mass and where the curves intersect the 95 cl or 99 cl lines indicate that the higgs mass should be below that intersection point with 95 or 99 confidence respectively sld's result is shown in red the cern result using leptonic asymmetries is shown in blue combined results from w mass measurements at cern and fermilab are shown in green the black band labeled other includes lep measurements of g z s had 0 and r l lep sld measurements of r b and r c sld measurements of a b and a c and nutev's measurement of r all these techniques are self consistent and prefer a light higgs mass but the cern result from the hadronic measurement of the weak mixing angle which uses the forward backward asymmetry in decays of the z 0 to b quarks shown in magenta favors a much heavier higgs this plot is made using da had m z 2 0.02738 0.00020 the 95 cl and 99 cl limits on the higgs mass are summarized in an accompanying table higgs mass plot comparing the lep a fb b measurement with the rest of the world's data combining all the world's data but excluding the lep a fb b result yields the curve shown in red and determines that the higgs should be lighter than 190 gev at 99 cl the magenta curve shows the forward backward b quark asymmetry result from lep in this case one finds that the higgs should be heavier than 190 gev at 99 cl this plot is made using da had m z 2 0.02738 0.00020 last updated 04 09 2001
