image based lighting 2 high dynamic range radiance map 2 high dynamic range radiance map here is a view of the computed radiance map scaled to a subset of the full dynamic range this is a plot of the recovered function red channel that maps radiance values to pixel values as you can see the data is somewhat noisy due to the limited control over exposure that my camera offers but the general trend is there copyright 2003 eric lee send comments to erl stanford edu last updated on june 9 2003
