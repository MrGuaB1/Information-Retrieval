sipma uribe manna deductive model checking deductive model checking henny sipma tomas uribe zohar manna we present an extension of classical tableau based model checking procedures to the case of infinite state systems using deductive methods in an incremental construction of the behavior graph logical formulas are used to represent infinite sets of states in an abstraction of this graph which is repeatedly refined in the search for a counterexample computation ruling out large portions of the graph before they are expanded to the state level this can lead to large savings even in the case of finite state systems only local conditions need to be checked at each step and previously proven properties can be used to further constrain the search although the resulting method is not always automatic it provides a flexible general and complete framework that can integrate a diverse number of other verification tools appeared in formal methods in system design vol 15 pp 49 74 1999 postscript pdf 1999 kluwer academic publishers last modified thu mar 29 10 04 31 pst 2001
