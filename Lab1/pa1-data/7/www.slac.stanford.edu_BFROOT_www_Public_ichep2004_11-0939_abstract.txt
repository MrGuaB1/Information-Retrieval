we report a measurement of the branching fraction e e b0b0bar with a data sample of 81.7 fb 1 collected at the upsilon 4s resonance with the babar detector at the pep ii asymmetric energy e e storage ring using partial reconstruction of the decay b0bar d ell bar nu _ ell we obtain a preliminary result of f00 0.486 0.010 stat 0.009 sys our result does not depend on branching fractions of the b0bar and the d decay chains on the simulated reconstruction efficiency on the ratio of the charged and neutral b meson lifetimes nor on assumption of isospin symmetry this measurement is important for normalizing many b decay branching fractions and contributes to our understanding of isospin violation in the upsilon 4s system
