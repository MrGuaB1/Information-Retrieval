using geant4 installation using the slac installation of the geant4 toolkit last modified current installation the latest geant4 libraries are centrally maintained and installed so that users may build and link their applications to them rather than build and maintain their own libraries geant4 9.4 is now installed on the 32 bit and 64 bit linux machines rhel4 32 rhel5 32 rhel4 64 rhel5 64 access to older libraries including geant4 9.3 patch02 is available upon request various data files required for optional geant4 processes and models are also centrally maintained and automatically accessed by the setup scripts accessing the slac installation to compile and link a simulation executable using the current geant4 toolkit several environment variables must first be set this is done in a script which also chooses the combination of geant4 and clhep libraries appropriate to the computing platform the script can be found in afs slac package geant4 g4setup env to begin choose a work directory and in it mkdir geant4 cd geant4 cp afs slac package geant4 g4setup env source g4setup env the essential variables set by this file are g4workdir working directory which will contain your specific code and the binary application g4install location of the installed code and libraries g4system g4 code for the system architecture clhep_base_dir base directory of the clhep libraries against which the toolkitis linked and against which your code should be linked clhep_lib location in the slac directory structure of clhep libraries built for a given platform g4setup env must be sourced each time you log in and want to rebuild or run the executable if you log in to a generic machine eg noric as opposed to a specific one eg noric10 the machine and hence the libraries may be different in this case clean and rebuild your application alternate method if you know the specific platform you are using rhel4 32 for example mkdir geant4 cd geant4 cp afs slac package geant4 9.4 env rhel4 32 csh source env rhel4 32 csh repeat this line each time you log in to this platform sh versions of this script are also available visualization interfaces for several visualization drivers have been compiled into the toolkit libraries currently the setup scripts choose opengl but the user may choose another driver by setting the appropriate environment variable before building the executable building and running the executable the following steps will lead you to a working executable with visualization using opengl go to your work directory in the above example geant4 from the geant4 installation copy the code for example 3 cp r g4install examples novice n03 n03 cd to n03 gmake gmake will create tmp and bin directories in your work directory the executable named examplen03 will be in bin g4system while in directory n03 run the executable bin g4system examplen03 if everything goes according to plan you should see the idle prompt on your screen after some preliminary output from this prompt type run beamon 1 to see an event displayed repeat until you get tired or bored when finished type exit at the idle prompt at this point you are ready to add to and modify the code in your copy of n03 for more information about developing your own simulation code using geant4 see the application developer's guide dennis wright
