external validation by parameter recovery page 1 external validation by parameter recovery an application to voter turnout model joint with thomas palfrey abstract we conduct a model validation analysis of several behavioral models of voter turnout using laboratory data our method of model validation is parameter recovery where estimation of a model is done under a veil of ignorance about some of experimentally controlled variables in this case voting costs we consider a benchmark quantal response equilibrium model and then extend it to allow for expressive voting altruism and group ethical voting we find that introducing heterogeneity into these models leads to worse parameter recovery in spite of generating significantly better fits to the data furthermore only the simplest quantal response equilibrium model without heterogeneity or other behavioral factors successfully recovers the true distribution of voting costs
