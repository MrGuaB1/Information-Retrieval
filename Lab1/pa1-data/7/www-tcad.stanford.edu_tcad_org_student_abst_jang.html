jaejune jang project abstract jaejune jang jangj gloworm stanford edu abstract thermal stability in rf transistors has been one of the major issue for the reliabilty of power amplifier a novel base ballasting scheme for interdigitated power rf bipolar transistors has demonstrated improved performance and thermal stability the nonlinear ballast resistor in series with each base finger is implemented by depletion mode fet which requires only minor modification in the fabrication process mixed mode simulation instead of analytical equations is used for more universal device analysis progress analysis efforts are now primarily focused on single device rf effects new ballasting scheme for power device was demonstrated using tcad mixed mode simulation at bctm 97 publications & presentations this quarter j jang ec kan rw dutton and t arnborg improved performance and thermal stability of interdigitated power rf bipolar transistors with nonlinear base ballasting 1997 bctm conf sept 1997 trips jaejune went on a spie student partner information exchange program trip to philips eindhoven and ericsson sweden sept 1997 he also attended the 1997 bctm conference on sept 28 30 where he presented a paper
