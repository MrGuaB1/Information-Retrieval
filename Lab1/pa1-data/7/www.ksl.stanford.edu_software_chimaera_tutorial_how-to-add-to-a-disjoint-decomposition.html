how to add a class to a disjoint decomposition how to add a class to a disjoint decomposition intoduction back next in this section you will learn how to add a class to an existing disjoint decomposition select cyc products saic products 2 weapon of mass destruction in the taxonomy menu before you actually modify the disjoint decomposition you need to merge a few of the subclasses of weapon of mass destruction this will mostly be review first deselect weapon of mass destruction by clicking on its name in the display select biolgical weapon by clicking on its name then select biological weapon in cyc products 22 by clicking on it select merge classes from the class to merge the biological weapons from different ontologies into one biological weapon now repeat the above process and merge the two chemical weapon classes into one class also merge the two nuclear weapon classes into one class the display should now show that the merged classes biological weapon chemical weapon and nuclear weapon are in a disjoint decomposition the class radiological weapon is currently not a member of that disjoint decomposition you will now add radiological weapon to the disjoint decomposition select radiological weapon by clicking on its name now select the disjoint decomposition by clicking on the green bar beside the classes that are currently in the disjoint decomposition you are now ready to add radiological weapon to the disjoint decomposition select add to decompositiion from the decomposition menu the display now shows that radiological weapon is a member of the disjoint decomposition in the next section you will learn how to upgrade a disjoint decomposition to a partition intoduction back next
