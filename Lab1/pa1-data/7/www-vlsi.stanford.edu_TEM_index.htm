image processing fro cryo electron microscopy stanford vlsi group image processing for cryo electron microscopy home overview papers software people link in recent years there has been increasing interest in using cryo tem tomography to study cells in close to their native environment one limitation of this technique is the relatively low signal to noise ratio in each of the tem images since the total electron dose through the sample must be constrained to limit structure damage to the cell even with gold markers added to the sample robust automatic alignment of the tem slice data for reconstruction remains difficult we have tried to address this problem by leveraging recent work in probabilistic analysis and have constructed a prototype alignment system using markov random fields mrf's for alignment and robust optimization methods for projective model estimation images and reconstructions courtesy of lr comolli different images from caulobacter using cryo electron microscopy
