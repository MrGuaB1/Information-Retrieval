cs348b 94 rendering competition cs 348b 1994 rendering competition cs 348b computer graphics image synthesis techniques winter quarter 1994 instructor marc levoy teaching assistants chase garfinkle and venkat krishnamurthy press here for a general introduction to these rendering competitions lipton bottle by maneesh agrawala and apostolos lerios maneesh and apostolos won the 94 rendering competition with a series of images and animations two of which are shown here see maneesh or apostolos's ray tracer page for more of their images the red lipton label and the refrigerate after opening label are scanned textures used to modify the color of the surfaces on which they are mapped the lipton engraving and the scratches on the glass as well as the uneven thickness of the glass are simulated using superimposed bump maps the glass thickness is modeled with a procedurally generated bump map while the other textures are scanned the effect of the two sided label was achieved by placing two labels one inside and one outside the bottle the internal one is a washed out and reversed version of the outer one seed by maneesh agrawala and apostolos lerios this image uses volume rendering of a mixture of ken perlin's fur and noisy sphere hypertextures the background is a flat surface whose color has been modulated by a very low frequency marble texture giving it the appearance of a clouded sky the lake surface is also a flat surface bump mapped with sine waves of varying frequencies all emanating from a point directly beneath the seed credit card by james davis this credit card was created using a series of masks to control different aspects of the surface the color was captured with an image scanner and masks were used to indicate the metallic regions as well as the surface scratches different shading models were used to simulate the appearance of metal and plastic the raised lettering was done using a bump map note the card number is fictitious you needn t worry about its exposure hottub by patrick witting this image was taken from an animation sequence consisting of 750 frames the steam rising from the water is a volume rendered turbulence function and the surface of the water has been bump mapped with a noise function to give it its rippled appearance final scene by gunnar farneback and lisa forssell the blobby objects in this scene were created by volume rendering density fields modulated with a noise function the credit card employs several textures to model the color the embossed text and scratches on the surface a direction dependent shading model was used to simulate the hologram in the colored text on the card aabhushan kosh by brian freyburger and todd smith this image is an attempt to photorealistically model a stone jewelry box from india the object was geometrically modeled by two dense polygon meshes its rendering made heavy use of an embedded lisp like shading language to generate the 3 dimensional stone texture control the placement of the peacocks on the box increase the specular reflectivity of the blue spots in the peacocks tails and perform bump mapping to give those spots the appearance of being raised from the surface swimming pool by brian lent and dimitrios mavroidis this scene was rendered by tracing light rays forward from the light source through the rippled surface of the water to deposit light on the surfaces in the scene standard backwards ray tracing was then used for the final rendering the caustics thus created can be scene in the patterns of light on the bottom of the pool and the distorted shadow of the diving board last update july 19 1994 cgar graphics stanford edu
