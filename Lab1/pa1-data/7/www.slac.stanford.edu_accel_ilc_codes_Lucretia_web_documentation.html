lucretia documentation lucretialogo the lucretia project other useful stuff documentation the main documentation for lucretia is this website all of the functions data structures etc are documented herein in addition all of the lucretia functions can make use of matlab's help command typing help functionname at the matlab prompt will cause a description of the function including syntax to appear at the moment there is not a printed manual as such for lucretia so far i think that the combination of command line help and online documentation is more useful however there are times when the network is not available but help is required in order to address that sort of issue the full contents of the lucretia website have been put into a zip ed archive which is available from the downloads web page quarkpt 28 june 2006 slac logo
