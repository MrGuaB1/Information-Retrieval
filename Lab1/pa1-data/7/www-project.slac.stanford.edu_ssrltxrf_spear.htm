spear home up feedback contents please note wafer level txrf measurements are no longer available details on txrf home page home up spear is the synchrotron storage ring used at slac to supply energetic electrons to the linear accelerator originally the parasitic radiation that came from accelerated electrons was considered a nuisance until the potential for high energy x ray experiments was realized since the accelerated electrons move at relativistic velocities a highly directional and polarized beam of x rays is emitted in the plane of the synchrotron experimenters recognized that these x rays also spanned a broad spectrum of energies allowing for precise energy tuning using monochromators these desirable traits lead to the development of beamlines where x rays are used for numerous experiments that are not possible with conventional x ray tubes shown below is a schematic of a typical synchrotron facility synchrotron radiation is used in our experiment as it provide a higher photon flux than conventional x ray sources and since the radiation is highly tunable this has allowed us to achieve extremely low detection limits that are unmatched by conventional txrf setups send mail to pianetta stanford edu with questions or comments about this web site last modified january 26 2007
