beam line 3 3 ssrl beam line 3 3 650 926 5233 back to beam lines page bl3 3 is not currently operating bl3 3 is a unique facility at ssrl with an in vacuum double crystal monochromator covering the energy range from 800 ev to 3.5 kev with four different monochromator crystals a multilayer monochromator covers the range from 1.4 to 2.0 kev with a wide bandwidth the station serves materials and environmental science applications with occasional use in biology over the past several years total reflection x ray fluorescence experiments have been also performed here given the higher powers anticipated from spear3 bl3 3 will be changed to a more standard x ray beam line design utilizing a pre monochromator collimating mirror a double crystal monochromator with both si 111 and insb 111 crystal pairs and a post monochromator focusing mirror the new configuration will give superior performance in the 1700 to 5000 ev energy range but will no longer cover the range 1000 1700 ev this class of experiments will be shifted to bl8 2 where they can be performed with a modified spherical grating monochromator beam line description beam line policy guide to working at ssrl beam line computing general information data collection data analysis data backup printers faqs staff support end of run summary form publishing experimental results content owner hal tompkins page editor lisa dunn last edited 8 sep 2005
