80386 programmer's reference manual section 10.3 up chapter 10 initialization prev 10.2 software initialization for real address mode next 10.4 software initialization for protected mode 10.3 switching to protected mode setting the pe bit of the msw in cr0 causes the 80386 to begin executing in protected mode the current privilege level cpl starts at zero the segment registers continue to point to the same linear addresses as in real address mode in real address mode linear addresses are the same physical addresses immediately after setting the pe flag the initialization code must flush the processor's instruction prefetch queue by executing a jmp instruction the 80386 fetches and decodes instructions and addresses before they are used however after a change into protected mode the prefetched instruction information which pertains to real address mode is no longer valid a jmp forces the processor to discard the invalid information up chapter 10 initialization prev 10.2 software initialization for real address mode next 10.4 software initialization for protected mode
