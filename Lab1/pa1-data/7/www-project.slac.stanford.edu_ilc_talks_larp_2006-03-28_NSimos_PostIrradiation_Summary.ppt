mercury target pressure shock uniform deposition case post irradiation results of the lhc collimator carbon carbon nick simos bnl report to the collaboration march 28 2006 there is good news & bad news in the end the good news win the bad news first these good news follow the not so good observation that the material suffers damage when it is exposed to very high proton fluence the material damage however is associated with material that has seen protons in excess of 3x10 21 protons cm 2 i do not believe that that will ever be anticipated at lhc therefore that issue is put to rest the bad news first weak direction fiber strong direction good news regarding phase i lhc collimator material while the analysis of the 2d carbon carbon material of the lhc phase i collimator is continuing it is evident that there is good news regarding the ability of the material to maintain the 25 micron constrain these good news follow the not so good observation that the material suffers damage when it is exposed to very high proton fluence the material damage however is associated with material that has seen protons in excess of 3x10 21 protons cm 2 i do not believe that that will ever be anticipated at lhc therefore that issue is put to rest non irradiated state of 2d carbon carbon 2d cc annealing behavior along the fiber planes shown below are some important and very relevant findings regarding the self healing of the 2d carbon carbon while irradiation alters the thermal expansion characteristics of the material key property in maintaining 25 micron movement of the jaws thermal cycling even of 200c corrects the damage or change induced the damage is corrected even on the heavily irradiated material which is shown below on the left is the annealing at 300c on the right is the search for the temperature threshold the experiment revealed that most of the damage is annealed even at 200c it is likely that the damage is continuously corrected for as long as the operating temperature exceeds say 200 c 2d cc annealing behavior along the fiber planes 2d cc annealing behavior along the fiber planes 2d cc annealing behavior along the fiber planes 2d cc annealing behavior normal to fiber planes the striking and very positive thing for the collimator jaws is that self healing also takes place along the weak direction direction with no fiber reinforcement the 2d carbon carbon apparently has company similar self healing behavior is observed in the 3d carbon carbon that has fibers normal to the xy planes and the super invar that has very low thermal expansion coefficient annealing behavior of 3d cc annealing behavior of super invar albemet apparent reduction in cte phase ii lhc collimator material irradiation primary materials copper glidcop 85 cu 15 al other potential candidates super invar gum metal test under same conditions 2d cc and 3d cc summary 2d carbon carbon selected is expected to meet the 25 micron requirement for as long as the collimator jaws intercepting the beam do not see more that 1.0 x 10 20 p cm 2 then there should not be any concern of material damage even along the weak direction it is in the plan to irradiate the 2d carbon again together with the 3d carbon this may and along with materials considered for phase ii this way there will be direct correlation between 2d and 3d carbon carbon on the basis that they will both be exposed to the same conditions further experimental scrutiny of the irradiated 2d carbon for effects of irradiation on thermal conductivity is planned for this summer
