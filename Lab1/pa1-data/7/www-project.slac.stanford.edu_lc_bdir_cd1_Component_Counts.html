component counts zdr and cd1 component counts component counts based on the zdr optics deck 6 30 98 documentation & disclaimer component lists & counts these are excel workbooks generated by andy ringwall which map the optics deck to magnet classes vacuum components magnet movers and bpms were added by hand at appropriate locations in the lattice the sheets list the parts linearly in 500m sections and parts counts are made in both 500m sections and globally additional sheets containing magnet engineering information are included as well rev 1 rev 2 with weak dipoles strung together parsed transport deck excel workbook of andy's parts lists collected by part type magnet bpm vacuum using the parsed transport deck an x coordinate using a slightly flawed algorithm is assigned to each part so that 2 d layouts can made component counts based on the cd 1 optics deck 10 30 98 documentation excel spread sheet with cd1 parts containing xtff sheet parts sheet magnet type sheet parts count pivot tables element length pivot tables beam line layouts by area parts layout by part type vaccum sheet with vacuum layout by vacuum part class excel spread sheet with cd1 parts defined so ir1 is at x return to the beam delivery home page last modified 08 14 00 tom markiewicz andy ringwall
