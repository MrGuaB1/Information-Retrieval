assignment 3 macro photography assignment 3 macro photography nicolas nicolas mathis this is by far my favorite composition it is the memorial church captured in a water drop to do this picture i parked my bike in front of the church and poured some drops on my bike's brakes handles i mounted my camera on a tripod and used a micrometric focusing rail to precisely move the camera even with such material refinement it was hard to focus on the plane in the drop because a lot of wing was blowing on the day the picture was shot thus i chose the av mode used f 14 with iso 400 on my macro lens canon 60mm for this picture exposure time is 1 40s this picture meets both requirements 1 and 5 the brake's handle or the church being man made objects i like that i was able to make a building part of a macro assignment previous back to all photos next
