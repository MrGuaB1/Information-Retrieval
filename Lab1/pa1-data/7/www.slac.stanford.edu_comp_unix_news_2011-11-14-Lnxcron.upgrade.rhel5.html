upgrading lnxcron to rhel5 nov 14 2011 slac national accelerator laboratory computing division upgrade of lnxcron to rhel5 nov 14 2011 slac computing unix at slac linux at slac updated 31 october 2011 we will be upgrading the host lnxcron from rhel4 to rhel5 on monday november 14 in preparation for this upgrade we have installed the rhel5 server zlnxcron which is available for login now and will take over for and be renamed lnxcron on november 14 the outage to switch zlnxcron over to the new lnxcron will start at 10am and should take no more than 30 minutes in preparation for this upgrade we suggest that you move your regular cronjobs from lnxcron to zlnxcron prior to the switch to make sure that they work as rhel5 cron jobs to avoid confusion computing division does not plan to move any of these cron jobs but will leave it to users to do so test any trscron jobs that are scheduled to run on lnxcron to make sure that they run on a rhel5 system like zlnxcron if you have additional questions about services please send email to unix admin renata dart
