sanchez sipma manna subramonian gill on efficient distributed deadlock avoidance for distributed real time and embedded systems on efficient distributed deadlock avoidance for distributed real time and embedded systems cesar sanchez henny b sipma zohar manna venkita subramonian christopher gill thread allocation is an important problem in distributed real time and embedded dre systems a too liberal thread allocation policy may cause deadlock a too conservative policy limits potential parallelism thus wasting resources however achieving global optimal thread utilization while avoiding deadlock has been proven impractical in distributed systems it requires too much communication between components in previous work we showed that efficient local thread allocation protocols are possible if the protocols are parameterized by global static data in particular an annotation of the global call graph of all tasks to be performed by the system we proved that absence of cyclic dependencies in this annotation guarantees absence of deadlock in this paper we present an algorithm to compute optimal annotations that is annotations that maximize parallelism while satisfying the condition of acyclicity moreover we show that the condition of acyclicity is in fact tight and exhibits a rather surprising anomaly if a cyclic dependency is present in the annotation of the call graph and a certain minimum number of threads is provided deadlock is reachable thus in the presence of cyclic dependencies increasing the number of threads may introduce the possibility of deadlock in an originally deadlock free system in proc of the 20th ieee int l parallel and distributed processing symposium ipdps 06 postscript pdf 2006 springer verlag henny sipma sipma cs stanford edu last modified thu jan 12 14 40 50 pdt 2004
