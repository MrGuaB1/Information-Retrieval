focusing mirror home up feedback contents please note wafer level txrf measurements are no longer available details on txrf home page home up a quartz focusing mirror is used at beamline 6 2 to remove high energy radiation and to focus the x rays at one spot high energy x rays are filtered from the spectrum by setting the incident beam at a grazing angle since the critical angle for total reflection increases with increasing x ray energy energetic x rays will penetrate into the mirror while lower energy x rays are reflected at a given angle focusing is achieved since the mirror is bent in a elliptical shape send mail to pianetta stanford edu with questions or comments about this web site last modified january 26 2007
