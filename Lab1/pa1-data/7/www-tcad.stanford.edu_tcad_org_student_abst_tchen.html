tao chen project abstract tao chen tchen gloworm stanford edu abstract mesh generation is very important in semiconductor process and device simulations with the advancing technologies in device design and manufacturing complex geometries are routinely used and a large number of processing steps are needed to capture those geometry features and evolving dopant stress profiles for accurate simulations a meshing program with good refinement derefinement capabilities becomes a necessity tree based mesh generation provides a good way of facilitating those adaptations which are crucial in placing optimal grid points to minimize computational time and improve accuracy camino is designed with that in mind to provide complete mesh and field services to process and device simulators progress progress has been made to incorporate the 2d level set algorithm into the original camino tree based mesh program the functionalities now include both the volume mesh triangulation and level set boundary movement a same quad tree camino internal grid is used as a reference grid to facilitate those functionalities adaptive gridding are also provided in both stages of triangulation and etching deposition it also preserves the field and geometry information during triangulation and boundary movement so that consistent storage is provided to client solvers like alamode in other stages of the simulation flow
