pandora pandora this page is intended to distribute the current version of a new physics event generator for linear collider studies called pandora the link below transmits a tar gz file containing the c++ code for pandora and some documentation the program pandora is a general purpose parton level event generator which includes beamstrahlung initial state radiation and full treatment of polarization effects an interface to pythia that produces fully hadronized events is described below this version includes the sm physics processes e e l l q qbar e e gamma gamma t tbar z gamma zz w w e e z higgs nu nubar higgs e e higgs nu nubar gamma gamma gamma l l q qbar t tbar e e w w higgs e gamma e gamma e z nu w ee ee and some illustrative beyond the sm processes e e l l q qbar e e with a z e e l l q qbar e e gamma gamma zz w w with hewett's contact interaction for extra dimensions e e gamma graviton e e t tbar with general production and decay form factors e e w w with a technirho resonance to download pandora click this link to receive a tar gz file this download contains all c++ files needed to run pandora simulations at the parton level some sample programs are contained in the directories smexamples sm3examples bsmexamples on a unix system it might well be possible to simply enter one of these directories type for the program ttevents cpp for example make ttevents and watch the program compile more often you will need to do some minor tinkering with the makefile eg change cc to g++ at the top programs whose names end in events generate a few events and output them to the console programs which end in example generate a few thousand events and create histograms of their properties as gnuplot gp graphics files pandora treats e e reactions only at the parton level to include hadronization you need the pandora_pythia interface written by masako iwasaki that can be obtained by following this link instructions for download and running of pandora_pythia are given on that page a manual for pandora is in preparation the manual will come in two parts first a user's guide to pandora and pandora pythia and second a documentation of the internal structure of pandora for those who would like to write their own processes the user's guide is now available from this link some less systematic documentation for pandora can be found in the documentation directory of this distribution this directory contains a pandora readme file with basic information it also has notes on the polarization conventions used in pandora the modification of beam and accelerator parameters and the still primitive susy processes included the default treatment of initial state radiation and beamstrahlung in pandora is described in more detail in my note lcc 0010 you can access that paper from this link please note that the current version of pandora also includes ohl's circe 1.0 beamstrahlung parametrizations as well as the option for user supplied parametrizations the current version 3 march 2003 is pandora 2.3 earlier versions of pandora can be obtained here pandora 2.0 august 2000 pandora 2.1 september 2000 pandora 2.2 september 2000 patches for the current 2.3 pandora please send comments or questions to michael e peskin slac
