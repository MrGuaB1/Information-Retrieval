conceptual modeling for distributed ontology environments conceptual modeling for distributed ontology environments knowledge systems laboratory stanford university abstract conceptual modeling for distributed ontology environments as ontologies become common in more applications and as those applications become larger and longer lived it is becoming increasingly common for ontologies to be developed in distributed environments by authors with disparate backgrounds ontologies that are expected to be collaboratively created and main tained over time by authors in many locations present special challenges to the prob lem of conceptual modeling in this paper we will discuss conceptual modeling issues and focus on those topics with elevated importance in distributed environments we will draw on our experience creating and maintaining ontologies in differing knowledge representation and reasoning environments over the last decade many of our recent observations are drawn from our experiences in the darpa high performance knowledge base program this program generated dozens of knowledge bases authored by people of varying expertise in both knowledge representation and reasoning as well as domain experience our efforts in merging the ontologies loading them for coordinated use and modifying them to meet evolving needs shape much of the material in this paper additional sources of observations are from designing and building a number of ecommerce ontologies and also from a few families of description logic applications including the prose questar family of configurators and the findur knowledge enhanced search applications deborah l mcguinness conceptual modeling for distributed ontology environments in proceedings of the eighth international conference on conceptual structures logical linguistic and computational issues iccs 2000 darmstadt germany august 14 18 2000 also published in lecture notes in computer science conceptual structures logical linguistic and computational issues volume 1867 2000 isbn 978 3 54 0 67859 5 pages 100 112 http dx doi org 10.1007 10722280_7 abstract word format postscript format return to selected papers of deborah l mcguinness home people software and network services projects contact technical reports links copyright 1999 stanford university all rights reserved
