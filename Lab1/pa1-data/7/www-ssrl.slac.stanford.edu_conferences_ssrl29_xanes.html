xanes workshop x ray absorption near edge spectra in analysis of mixtures stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory wednesday october 9 2002 orange room slac organizers ingrid pickering & graham george a workshop on x ray absorption near edge spectra in analysis of mixtures chaired by ingrid pickering ssrl and graham george ssrl was held on october 9 2002 x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of local atomic environment oxidation state and electronic structure and can thus be used as a fingerprint of particular chemical environments no special sample preparation is required and the incident x rays probe a given element regardless of its physical form solid liquid or gaseous because of this x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy can be a powerful method for analysis of chemical form in complex samples such as mixtures and has already found a wide range of applications least squares fitting can be used to quantitatively determine the abundances of various chemical species in a mixture in the case of a set of related mixtures principal component analysis can be used to determine the number of individual components in the set and target transformation can be used to test whether a given standard spectrum is one of the components after an introductory talk by roger prince exxonmobil research and engineering presentations were made concerning the methodology of edge analysis by graham george ssrl and stephen wasserman advanced x ray analytical services applications were drawn from a broad range of disciplines and included identification of mn particulates emitted from auto engines joe wong llnl arsenic speciation in bangladeshi aquifers andrea foster usgs elucidating the chemistry of ascidian blood cells pat frank ssrl and proposing preservation methods for the swedish warship vasa farideh jalilehvand u calgary during final sessions participants were given the opportunity to try out principal component analysis and other edge analysis routines using the suite of programs exafspak written by graham george ssrl running on either in house pcs or on personal laptops agenda 9 00 welcome 9 05 overview and introduction roger prince exxonmobil research and engineering company 9 40 analysis of near edge spectra graham george ssrl 10 15 principal component analysis stephen wasserman advanced x ray analytical services inc 10 50 break 11 10 quantitative analysis using xanes spectroscopy in combination iwth pca and lsf a case study for mn particulates emitted from auto engines joe wong lawrence livermore national laboratory 11 45 coupled principal component least squares analysis of as k edge xanes spectra model and natural systems andrea foster us geological survey 12 20 lunch 1 20 metallobiochemistry at ph 0 fits to the vanadium k edge xas spectra of ascidian blood cells pat frank stanford university 1 55 sulfur spectroscopy and the 17th century swedish warship vasa farideh jalilehvand university of calgary 2 30 preview of exafspak pca target analysis programs graham george ssrl 2 45 discussion 3 00 break 3 15 hands on analysis sessions building 50 scs room 111 scs computer lab for slac pcs room 115 video conferencing center slac 1 for laptops tutors pat frank serena george hugh harris graham george & ingrid pickering 5 00 close
