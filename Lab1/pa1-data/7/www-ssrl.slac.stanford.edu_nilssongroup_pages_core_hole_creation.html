core level spectroscopies surface science and x ray spectroscopy group core level spectroscopy creation and decay of core holes spectroscopic techniques we can create a core hole through the absorption of incoming light with energy matched to the binding energy of a core electron this absoprtion causes the core electron to be excited to a bound state or to the continuum where it will become a free particle the creation of a core hole by ionization forms the basis for xps while the creation of a core hole by excitation is studied in xas after ionization the absorbing atom is in a highly excited state due to the creation of a core hole soon after the atom relaxes via the core hole decay non radiant dexcitation of core holes forms the basis for aes while radiant decay is studied in xes both of which provide tools for probing ocuppie d electronic structure of a model system these events only consider a core ionized initial state prior to the decay however an in itial state with the core electron instead excited into a bound state can modify the decay process the two steps creation and decay can lead to coupling and the whole process can be considered a one step event these events are called resonant processes and can involve radiant and non radiant decays the excited electron can either participate in the decay process or be passive as a spectator leading to very different types of final states as shown below click here or follow the links below for a more detailed description of the different spectroscopic techniques creation of core holes ionization excitation x ray pho toelectron spectroscopy xps x ray absorption spectroscopy xas x ray inelastic scattering xis decay of core holes non radiant radiant auger electron spectrosopy aes x ray emission spectrosopy xes resonant processes non radiant resonant photoelectron spectroscopy rpes resonant auger spectroscopy raes autoionization spectroscopy ais radiant resonant inelastic x ray scattering rixs resonant x ray emission spectroscopy rxes participator decay one hole final state font spectator decay 2 hole 1 electron final state participator decay recombination process ground state spectator decay one hole one electron final state back to introduction
