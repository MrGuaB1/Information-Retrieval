lucretia random numbers and seeds lucretialogo the lucretia project random numbers and seeds for many simulation studies it is important or useful to get complete control over the generation of random numbers and to ensure that a given randomly generated state can be exactly reproduced at a later date lucretia functions use the matlab rand and randn random number generators for flat and gaussian distributed random numbers respectively hence any lucretia simulation can be reproduced by taking control of the seeds states used by these two random number generators more specifically the random number generators will be advanced by the following functions makebeampzgauss advances gaussian random number generator randn makebeam6dgauss advances gaussian random number generator randn errorgroupgausserrors advances gaussian random number generator randn setgaussianerrors advances gaussian random number generator randn trackthru when bpm readings are returned the gaussian random number generator randn is advanced when synchrotron radiation modes 2 or 3 are used the flat random number generator rand is advanced quarkpt 11 feb 2006 slac logo
