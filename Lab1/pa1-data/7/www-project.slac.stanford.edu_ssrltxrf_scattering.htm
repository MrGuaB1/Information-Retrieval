scattering home up feedback contents please note wafer level txrf measurements are no longer available details on txrf home page home up many mechanisms in the txrf process can increase the background and lead to poorer detection limits as shown in the spectrum below the two types of scattering seen with our setup are elastic or rayleigh scattering and inelastic or compton scattering elastic scattering occurs when photons interact in a wave like manner with firmly bound inner core electrons that results in a change of direction but a conservation of energy compton scattering occurs when photons interact in a particle like manner with loosely bound electrons and therefore a loss of energy and a change in direction simultaneously occur finally as seen in the spectrum below an escape peak resulting from silicon fluorescence x rays escaping the pin detector can also contribute to the background send mail to pianetta stanford edu with questions or comments about this web site last modified january 26 2007
