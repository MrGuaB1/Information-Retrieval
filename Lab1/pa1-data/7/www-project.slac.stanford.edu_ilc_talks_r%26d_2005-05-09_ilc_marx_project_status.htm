ilc marx project status ilc marx project status 6 may 2005 this week we performed tests to map actual peak short circuit currents vs gate drive levels results shown here http www group slac stanford edu esd ilc isatvsvg gif from the graph it seems that a good starting point for vg is about 11.5 volts this gives ample headroom factor of 3 above the normal 150a while providing enough gate drive to keep the vsat low 1.6 v vg can easily be changed later if desired we re now preparing to connect a full stack of switch segments together to characterize the total switch performance at full rated voltage and current the floors for the ilc marx test area http www group slac stanford edu esd ilc testlayout gif in bldg 15 were completed yesterday and move in of equipment started today next week we plan to assemble the switch segments and possibly obtain some preliminary test data the technical review following the preliminary switch development is scheduled for may 23 10 00 in the bldg15 conference room
