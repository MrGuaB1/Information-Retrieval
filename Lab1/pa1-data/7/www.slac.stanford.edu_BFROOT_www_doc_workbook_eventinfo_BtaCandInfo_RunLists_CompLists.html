babar workbook composite particles lists of composite particles the following run time lists are produced in any analysis job that includes betaminisequence and betaminiphysicssequence on its path this is true for most analysis jobs see below for more information about the lists composite particle lists track sublists ks lists pi0 lists eta and etaprime lists kstar lists charmless lists rho phi omega etc lambda lists sigma lists d0 lists dc lists dstar lists dstar0 lists jpsi lists psi2s lists breco lists photon lists bremstrahhlung electrons lists klong lists about the lists most of the lists are produced by the simplecomposition package therefore this documentation mostly follows the syntax of the simplecomposition package most of the charts have three columns list name the name of the list this is the name you would use to access the list from your module input list a list of composite particles can be produced in two ways by forming the composite particles from its daughters or by taking an already made list the input list of composite particles and tightening the selection criteria selection cuts that the candidate and or its daughters must pass in order to be placed on the list there are also merged lists produced by merging two or more already made lists without added selection depending on the context i have either placed both of these lists in the input lists column or in a separate two column table for merged lists for cuts the following syntax is used variable max min for example x acut means x acut y bcut means y bcut z ccut dcut means ccut z dcut for fits the syntax is fit method constraint for example fit add4 mass means that the fit uses add4 algorithm with mass constraint for the meanings of the variables and fit types see the simplecomposition webpage back to workbook front page send comments to workbook team
