gnu coding standards naming variables and functions go to the previous next section naming variables and functions please use underscores to separate words in a name so that the emacs word commands can be useful within them stick to lower case reserve upper case for macros and enum constants and for name prefixes that follow a uniform convention for example you should use names like ignore_space_change_flag don t use names like icantreadthis variables that indicate whether command line options have been specified should be named after the meaning of the option not after the option letter a comment should state both the exact meaning of the option and its letter for example ignore changes in horizontal whitespace b int ignore_space_change_flag when you want to define names with constant integer values use enum rather than define gdb knows about enumeration constants use file names of 14 characters or less to avoid creating gratuitous problems on system v you can use the program doschk to test for this doschk also tests for potential name conflicts if the files were loaded onto an ms dos file system something you may or may not care about go to the previous next section
