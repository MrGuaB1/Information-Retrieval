assignment 6 landscape and nature assignment 6 landscape and nature wendy wendy mu sunrise requirement 2 improve on nature with photoshop requirement 3 panorama requirement 5 the golden hour this was taken on the same trip to lake lag as the previous pictures this also satisfies the golden hour requirement because it was taken a little after 6 20 am i wanted the plants in the foreground and the trees in the background to be in focus so i used a smaller aperture of f 22.0 i used photomerge in ps to merge 10 pictures together into this panorama afterwards i cropped the picture and changed the brightness in various parts of the picture to make the sky slightly darker and more vibrant and the grass lighter i also locally edited the fog because it was bright after my global edits so i changed it so it was about as bright as in the original image previous back to all photos next
