txm imaging fig 7 txm imaging of osteoporotic mouse bone left txm 5x5 mosaic composite of osteoporotic mouse bone with phase contrast at 8 kev osteoporosis was induced by hind limb unloading a nasa developed method to simulate microgravity effects in ground experiments in contrast to above image of loaded mouse bone the edges of unloaded mouse bone are distinctly different with rough pitted surfaces these results serve as a preliminary demonstration that we can distinguish between hind limb loaded and unloaded bones using txm this has implications for studies of osteoporosis and for astronauts spending time in weightless environments right averaged 20 1 sec scans high resolution image of lacuna from mosaic on the left
