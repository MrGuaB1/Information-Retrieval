assignment 8 portraiture and light assignment 8 portraiture and light changwhan changwhan yea requirement 2 indoor natural light portrait i experimented with the shadows of window frames and casting its line on the model's body to give an interesting twist the only light source is the sun coming through the window and therefore it creates a huge shadow on the left side of his face i could have used flash to eliminate the shadow but the whole concept was grief so it made sense to leave it i boosted the vibrance slightly on photoshop to make his skin color more lively previous back to all photos next
