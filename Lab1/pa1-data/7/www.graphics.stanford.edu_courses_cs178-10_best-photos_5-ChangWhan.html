assignment 5 still life assignment 5 still life changwhan changwhan yea requirement 3 caustics background white printing paper both on floor & back wall curved the back wall paper into the paper on the fall to eliminate the borderline between the two papers light white desk lamp positioned on the back of the bottles and facing downwards i took some of my roommate's calvin klein perfumes and set them on my mini studio due to the light in the back the caustic effect illuminated the bottles towards the camera like mood lights since the light source was really close to the subjects it created a vignetting effect on the background at the outer corners where the light rays did not reach also because the light was beaming straight at the lens i had to reduce the aperture to minimum size and turn off every other light source in the room white balance was intentionaly set to 3rd degree tungsten adding a blue shade on top of the entire scene i realized that it d be cool to make my own advertisement of the calvin klein man series so i placed the bottles on top of the image and left space on the bottom for the logo post processing was crucial for the resulting image the euphoria bottle had much cleaning to do i brushed off the dust on its lid and erased the distracting reflection of the obsession bottle the vignetting effect on the outer corners was also unbalanced so i copied the right corner into a different layer reversed it and placed it on top of the left corner i googled the calvin klein logo manually carved out the letters with the eraser tool and placed it in the center of the bottom previous back to all photos next
