radio science group welcome personnel research publications the big dish the stanford big dish a picture of the dish can be seen in the top left corner of this page about the dish in the foothills behind stanford university sits a 150 foot 46 meters diameter radio telescope which has come to be known simply as the dish originally constructed in the 1960's to probe the scattering properties of the earth's ionosphere the dish has been utilized in numerous research pursuits in its 30 plus years of existence even before the dish was constructed it was recognized that the structure would become a university icon in the original proposal dated august 1958 to construct the antenna at is present site it is written it is proposed that the transmitter and other equipment be housed in a one story building which would be designed and positioned so as to be relatively inconspicuous the large parabolic antenna however cannot be hidden it is a more pleasing structure than some of the radio antennas that have been used in the past it is expected that this large geometrical structure used for important scientific research would become widely known as a stanford university landmark specifications the dish is maintained by sri international the specifications for the dish come courtesy of mike cousins sri international and are as follows antenna type parabolic reflector site stanford university radio science field site academic reserve area horizon maximum 3 degrees diameter 150 feet 45.7 meters f d ratio 0.42 focus is 63 feet from surface at center surface mesh 5 8 inch spacing soft aluminum hex pattern surface roughness approximately 1 inch gravitational deformation approximately 1 inch at edge for minimum to maximum elevation beamwidth gain attainable with appropriate feeds l band 1420 mhz 0.25 degree beamwidth 35 efficiency 52 db uhf 400 mhz 1.0 degree beamwidth 55 efficiency 43 db vhf 150 mhz 3.0 degree beamwidth 55 efficiency 35 db feed arrangement prime focus tripod structure feed house tilting feed platform for small apparatus high power cables reflector structure steel torus ring aluminum tubular rings and radial trusses non homologous light weight design reflector structure weight 100000 pounds total structure weight 300000 pounds motion elevation over azimuth wheel and track cr 170 rail steel 4 wheel alidade on 140 foot diameter track for azimuth rack bull gear and pinion spur gears for elevation motion practical limits azimuth 2 turns elevation 3 to 87 degrees azimuth cable wrap via central hole and tunnel programmed tracking speed 1 degree second useful for leo satellite tracking to elevations of approximately 65 degrees programmed tracking acceleration 1 degree second 2 motion control ac vector controlled 25 hp motors giving full torque through entire speed range to including 0 with dynamic braking 60 hp capacity control computer pc with appropriate multiple parallel interfaces programmed in pascal code similar to sondrestromfjord greenland incoherent scatter radar gps timing available positional resolution 0.01 degrees azimuth and elevation 1 turn binary optical encoders unique azimuth encoder offset mechanical connection
