ilcpes study group ilc polarized electron source study group welcome initial invitation subscribers email archives purpose the purpose of the ilc polarized electron source ilcpes study group is 1 to specify the required performance parameters of the pes 2 to develop a detailed initial design for the pes that will satisfy these parameters and 3 to identify and prioritize the needed r&d components that are complimentary to the initial design and also that would point to next generation designs scope a polarized electron source consists as a minimum of a gun with a photocathode a laser system and associated support systems such as vacuum and instrumentation since the injector which normally contains bunchers as well as the first accelerating section and source design are intimately connected the ilcpes sg will consider the two as a single design problem mailing list a slac mailing list ilc pes exists for communications about ilcpes information about this list can be found here instructions for subscribing to the list can be found here subscribers can post messages by sending email to ilc pes slac stanford edu archives of the ilc pes mail items can be found here conferences workshops meetings the 18th international spin physics symposium spin 2008 october 6 11 2008 charlottesville va usa workshop on sources of polarized electrons and high brightness electron beams the physics and technology of achieving high polarization high current and low emittance electron beams pes 2008 october 1 3 2008 jefferson lab va usa xii international workshop on polarized sources and targets pstp 2007 september 10 14 2007 brookhaven national laboratory bnl upton ny usa workshop on high qe photocathodes for rf guns october 4 6 2006 milano it the 17th international spin physics symposium spin 2006 october 2 7 2006 kyoto jp session 9b polarized electron sources presentations ilc polarized e e+ source meeting presentation by m kuriki 2nd polarized rf gun meeting june 5 2006 slac menlo park ca usa ilcpes study group one day meeting november 18 2005 nagoya jp notes xi th international workshop on polarized sources and targets pst05 november 14 17 2005 tokyo jp to view presentations click on link above then select scientific program there are 6 pes related presentations 11 15 morning session ii polarized electron beam i poelker jlab clendenin slac yamamoto nagoya 11 17 morning session ii polarized electron beam ii farkhondeh mit ioakeimidi slac kuwahara nagoya 1st polarized rf gun meeting november 7 2005 fnal batavia il usa second ilc accelerator workshop august 14 27 2005 snowmass colorado usa links ilc asia working group 3 beam sources injectors and damping rings ilc slac polarized electron source group ilc newsline
