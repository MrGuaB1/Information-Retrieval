h1 h1 exceptions every document should have one and only one h1 element normally h5 and h6 should not be used and even h4 is rarely needed if you feel the need for more than 3 or 4 headings consider breaking your document into multiple hypertext nodes ie put the text into more than one file and adjust the markup accordingly html defines six heading levels these should be thought of as roughly analogous to chapters sections and subsections etc in a conventional document it should not be thought of as a way to get a particular graphic effect a heading element implies all the font changes paragraph breaks before and after and white space necessary to render the heading but these changes are the responsibility of the browser software and the human reading the text not the author further character emphasis or paragraph marks are neither required nor appropriate in html headings nor can heading appear other markup except for body blockquote in the case that you are quoting another html fragment and form for example b h2 summer session hours h2 b is illegal h2 b summer session hours h2&gt b is syntactially legal but very bad form since it is the prerogative of the reader and his her browsing software to determine the appearance of heading text there are circumstances in which incorporating highlighting markup may be the only way to convey the meaning of the heading but these are are rare and do not justify misuse of the markup rules note that paragraphs following a header ie those paragraphs that are part of the section must have p tags surrounding them despite warnings in some style guides to the contrary the heading elements are h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 with h1 being the highest level of heading for example h1 the big problems h1 p here is some text it should be considered part of heading 1 p h2 overview of the problems h2 p here is some more text it should be considered part of overview of the problems ie the first heading 2 h3 historical background to the problems h3 p here is some more text it should be considered part of historical background ie heading3 h2 problem 1 the economic situation h2 p here is some more text it should be considered part of problem 1 the economic situation ie the second heading 2 p note although heading levels can be skipped for example from h1 to h3 this practice is discouraged as skipping header levels may produce unpredictable results when generating other representations from html exceptions sometimes documents have a small quantity of preliminary material such as a journal title volume and issue number that is repeated from article to article it is not always inappropriate to do something like h3 scientific american br january 1995 h3 h1 ensuring the longevity of digital documents h1 similarly repeated material at the tail of every document might appropriately be given the same kind of markup even if it violates the general rule the key point is that h1 should identify the major heading for the document and that h2 h3 etc should identify succesive nested sections and subsections within a heading content pcdata a anchor source and or destination of a link b bold text br line break cite name or title of cited work code source code phrase em emphasized phrase i italic text img image icon glyph or illustration kbd keyboard phrase eg user input samp sample text or characters strong strong emphasis tt typewriter text var variable phrase or substitutable tag minimization open tag required close tag required see attributes see content declaration parent elements blockquote quoted passage body document body form fill out or data entry form top element list all element list tree html s dtd
