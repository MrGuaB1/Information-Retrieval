frugl frugl frugl is a light weight rendering interface derived from opengl the goal of frugl is to provide a platform for research in rendering systems the library is simple enough to be implemented and maintained within a research environment but retains large scale architectural characteristics which are critical in real world libraries but often lost in research systems in particular the interface is purely immediate mode supports strict ordering and supports single buffered rendering with no frame semantics in addition to the basic interface we have designed a set of parallel api extensions for coordinating multiple simultaneous user threads rendering into the same scene we have also developed a tracing library which allows the capture and playback of streams of frugl calls for the purposes of trace driven simulation gws graphics stanford edu
