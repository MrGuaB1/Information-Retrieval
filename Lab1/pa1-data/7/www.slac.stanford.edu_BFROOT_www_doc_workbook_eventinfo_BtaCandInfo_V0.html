v0btatrack list v0btatrack list is a list of btacandidate objects that combines k s lambda and gamma conversions that are identified as such by the trkv0selector module in the trkfixup package this page describes the selection of these particles see bad 1628 for other aspects of trkfixup variable cut value k s lambda gamma conversions invariant mass of the track pair pdg 0.007 gev pdg 0.007 gev 0 0.03 gev distance between the v 0 vertex and the primary vertex 0.5 cm 80 cm 1.5 cm 80 cm distance of closest approach of the track pair 0.75 cm vertex probability of the track pair 0.02 primary pointing dot product of the v 0 flight direction with the normalized displacement vector from the primary vertex 0.998 number of dch hits before the v 0 vertex 2 use of detector pid information n a see below in addition the detector level pid information is used to further discriminate the lambda and the gamma conversions this combines the knowledge from the drc dch and svt detectors for the lambda the higher momentum track must be more likely to be a proton than a pion the gamma conversion pair must be on average more likely an electron positron pair than a pion pair as defined by the product of the probabilities prob track1 e prob track2 e prob track1 pi prob track2 pi 1 page maintainer tomohiko tanabe last updated 11 20 2007
