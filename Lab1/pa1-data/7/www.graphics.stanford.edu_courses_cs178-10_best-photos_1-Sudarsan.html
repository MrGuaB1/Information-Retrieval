assignment 1 bad photos assignment 1 bad photos sudarsan sudarsan acharya a spinning and precessing 2 euro coin requirements 1 and 2 a spinning and precessing 2 euro coin focal length 55mm nikon d60 auto focus zoom shutter priority mode metering center shutter speed 1 50s aperture f5 6 exposure compensation 0.7 ev iso 400 white balance fluorescent the coin is spinning towards the corner of my table and i used lighting from my fluorescent table lamp the background was darkened using a black sheet of paper and the low light setting ensured that the edges of the table were focused clearly without stray light from around the table also the texture of the table surface adds life to the coins path the coins periphery is blurred but the 2 engraving is clearly visible and the coin appears as if its converging at the corner of the table and moving into darkness actually that happened many times ie the coin flew out of the edge immediately as i spun it on the table and it took me about an hour to get the coin spin the right way and get the shot i wanted as well previous back to all photos next
