linux farm node installation our linux installation infrastructure is for re installing large amounts of linux farm nodes fully automatic and unattended here are pictures of slac's current linux farm installations this is our 16 node linux cluster interconnected with pci64 lanai 9 myrinet 2000 all nodes are 866mhz dual pentium iii va1220 running red hat 7.2 this is one half of our 512 node linux cluster all nodes are 866mhz dual pentium iii va1220 running red hat 7.2 or 6.2 this is one half of our 512 node linux cluster the other half is in the backside of the same racks all nodes are 1.4 gmhz dual pentium iii rackable systems running red hat 7.2 or rhel 3.0 this is about one half of our 64 node linux cluster interconnected with 64 bit pci x pcixd lanai x myrinet 2000 all nodes are 2.6 ghz dual xeon pentium iv rackable systems running rhel 3.0 these are 128 of our 384 node linux cluster the backside of the same racks has another 128 nodes all nodes are 2.6 ghz dual xeon pentium iv rackable systems running rhel 3.0 june 21 2004 courtesy of dr alf wachsmann
