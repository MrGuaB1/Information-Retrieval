approximations for markov perfect industry dynamics page 1 approximations for markov perfect industry dynamics gabriel weintraub columbia business school dynamic oligopoly models are used in industrial organization to analyze diverse dynamic phenomena the applicability of these models has been severely limited however by the computational complexity involved in solving for the markov perfect equilibrium mpe in previous work we introduced oblivious equilibrium oe a new solution concept for approximating mpe that dramatically reduces the computational complexity weintraub benkard and van roy 2007 2008 in this work we introduce several important extensions to oe first in order to capture short run transitional dynamics that may result for example from shocks or policy changes we develop a nonstationary version of oe second in order to capture the effects of industry wide business cycles we extend the definition of oe to accommodate models with aggregate random shocks for both solution concepts we present algorithms for bounding approximation error and report results from computational case studies our results suggest that our methods greatly increase the set of dynamic oligopoly models that can be analyzed computationally this is joint work with c lanier benkard przemyslaw jeziorski and benjamin van roy
