single crystal xas single crystal xas the smb xas group is developing instrumentation for single crystal xas on bl9 3 at ssrl the intent of the development is to allow nearly simultaneous xas and crystallographic data collection the implementation includes a huber kappa goniometer canberra 30 element ge detector for xas data collection open flow he and n2 coolers microscope for crystal alignment in the beam and a mar ccd or mar 345 crystallography detector the kappa goniometer allows a large accessible angle range with an open geometry affording access to detectors and open stream coolers applicable standard hardware on ssrl crystallography beam lines has been incorporated with crystallographic data collection controlled via the blu ice software developed by the ssrl smb macromolecular crystallography group xas data collection is handled through the ssrl standard xas collect software
