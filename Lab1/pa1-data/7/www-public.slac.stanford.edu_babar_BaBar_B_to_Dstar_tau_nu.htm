observation of the decay b d  and implications for charged higgs bosons home performance data results about babar employment organization links updated sunday august 07 2011 observation of the decay b d  and implications for charged higgs bosons decays of b mesons into  leptons the heavy third generation cousins of the electron and muon provide an interesting probe of possible new physics at high mass scales while semileptonic decays of b mesons b d l l where l represents an electron or muon and d is a meson containing a charm c quark have long been used to measure of properties of the standard model sm the case where l is a  lepton is unique the large mass of the  implies an affinity to higgs bosons within the sm the higgs boson is related to the mechanism by which the quarks leptons and force carrying gauge bosons acquire mass consequently they are predicted to couple more strongly to heavier particles than to lighter ones in extensions of the sm such as supersymmetry susy there can be multiple electrically neutral and charged higgs bosons but the property of preferentially coupling to more massive particles remains true in b d   the initial b meson and the final state d and  all contain massive quarks or leptons making it a very sensitive probe of possible higgs effects however because the  rapidly decays into a variety of lighter particles including neutrinos  which pass undetected through particle detectors the process b d   has until recently eluded detection the babar collaboration presented new preliminary results on these decay modes at the europhysics conference on high energy physics 2011 eps 2011 the results which are based on the full babar experiment data set and which benefitted from recent improvements in babar event reconstruction and particle identification techniques are significantly more sensitive than previously published studies of these decays babar recorded in excess of 470 million b meson pairs produced in the process  4s b b between 1999 and 2008 to deal with the missing neutrinos from the  decays in b d   babar identified and reconstructed all of the decay products associated with the second b meson in each  4s decay enabling them to infer the presence of the missing neutrinos from conservation of energy and momentum advanced multivariate techniques were used to distinguish signal events from possible backgrounds from other b decays or non b bb events babar observed b d   at more than 5 significance in each of four individual decay modes b d 0    b d 0    b 0 d    and b 0 d    reporting first observations of the b d   modes because higgs bosons prefer to couple to  leptons comparison of the observed rate for b d   with b d l l with l e  could reveal evidence for a charged higgs boson h in fact this test is more sensitive to h than direct searches for these particles at the lhc at cern interestingly the new babar results see fig 1 while not incompatible with a sm interpretation favours the existence of a h with a significance of about 1.8  previous measurements of the related decay b   show similar excesses compared with the sm expectations possibly hinting at new physics in the higgs sector figure 1 the ratio r d of the rates for b d   compared to b d l l l e  plotted as a function of the higgs parameter tan  and the charged higgs boson mass m h the h prediction from m tanaka and r watanabe phys rev d82 034027 2010 is shown as a violet band and the babar measurement as the horizontal blue band the standard model expectation for r d is approximately 0.31 a similar excess is measured in the case of r d your browser does not have the ability to display inline frames you can view the content of this frame at this page slac footer content cowan page cowan valid html 4.01 valid css
