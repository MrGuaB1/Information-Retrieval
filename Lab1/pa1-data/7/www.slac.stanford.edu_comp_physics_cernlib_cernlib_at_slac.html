cernlib at slac slac cernlib at slac 6 november 2002 contents platforms access and organization environment variables current levels of the cernlib binaries on unix cernlib 2003 on cygwin documentation and help vms platforms cernlib at slac is installed for a number of unix platforms as of 2002 linux and solaris platforms are the only two platforms for which new versions of cernlib are installed older versions of cernlib are still available for ibm rs6000 systems running aix hp systems running hp unix and dec alpha systems running osf access and organization all access to cernlib should be through the symbolic link cern in this directory you will find among other things directories such as 93d 94a 94b 95a 96a 97a 98 99 2000 2001 2002 which contain the various levels of cernlib avialable you will also find the following symbolic links old pro new which point to different levels pro for production points to the level considered current at slac old points to the previously current level new points to the newest level for example the current production cernlib binaries live in cern pro bin and the current production cernlib libraries live in cern pro lib in this way you will automatically access the current version appropriate for the platform you are logged into note in 2001 we stopped moving these links because an incompatibility caused problems for the babar experiment therefore pro still points to the 2000 version of cernlib newer versions can of course be accessed using constructs such as cern 2002 lib environment variables some cernlib programs assume that certain environment variables are set when you work in a group eg babar some utilities may assume that other environment variables are set what these are depends a bit on which group you are in and some groups tell you to execute source a certain script in your cshrc after you log in you might have for example the following environment variables set cern cern cern_level pro cern_root cern pro geant_version 321 in the past some groups have been using definitions such as cern usr local cernlib aix6000 this is no longer supported current levels of the cernlib binaries on unix in 1997 the installation at slac was modernized for the unix platforms and will stay within a few months up to date with the cernlib level as it is installed at cern below is a table of the most recent meanings of old pro and new for the most recent platform os release combinations older platform os release combinations may have their links set differently link table link as of 9 september 1999 as of 3 november 1999 as of 1 february 2000 as of 1 march 2000 as of 1 august 2001 old 97a 98 98 99 99 pro 98 99 99 2000 2000 new 99 99 2000 2000 2001 for other information see also the cernlib future plans from cern for the supported platform os release combinations cernlib 2003 on cygwin a cygwin version produced locally here at slac of the 2003 version of cernlib is available on afs in the directory afs slac package cernlib cygwin cern 2003 if you use openafs on your windows machine you may mount its parent directory afs slac package cernlib cygwin cern as a drive letter say g on your system then you can create a cern volume in cygwin as follows mount s bg cern & dev null then add cern 2003 bin to your path and link your programs using the cernlib script as usual if you need to have this version on your own computer you may download the following compressed tar files libraries binaries includes sources optional to use these install them in some directory say home willy cern 2003 then mount its parent directory directory as a volume cern mount s b home willy cern cern & dev null notes this version of cernlib is a modified version of the official cernlib 2003 distribution it is not itself an official distribution and it is only provided as a convenience to slac affiliated personnel neither slac stanford nor i assume any guarantees that this distribution will work for any purpose whatsoever or any implied responsibilities for future maintenance the binaries for this version were created using cygwin gcc version 3.2 note further that this version is not the same as the version created by zhiguo yao which was found not to compile with my current version of cygwin libraries and compilers documentation and help for various sources of information see guide to cernlib and anaphe at slac vms if you must use cernlib software on a vax vms machine put the command cern_home cern_login in your login com file this will initialize logical variables like cern lib the vms version of cernlib software at slac is not recommended incomplete and frozen currently the only working version of paw on slacvx is pawx11_m in the new area levels and directories are listed in the tables below libraries on vms platform old pro new vax vms cern old cern lib cern new executables on vms platform old pro new vax vms cern oldexe cern cernexe cern newexe willy langeveld
