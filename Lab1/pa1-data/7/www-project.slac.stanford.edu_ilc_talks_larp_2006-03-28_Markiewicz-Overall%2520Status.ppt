charge to the committee project summary t markiewicz 2006 03 28 cern us larp video meeting our intermediate deliverable to project and cern was is a design report documenting studies and defining what we were going to build and how we were going to test it due date was 2005 09 30 draft available on web page us larp project to slac was large & adequate to begin construction us larp management wanted external review before we begin to cut metal and spend larger funds committee wants more work before conceptual design for prototype could be considered ready for construction close out remarks at us larp rc1 prototype cdr lr bertolini llnl a makarov fnal wc turner lbnl slac dec 15 2005 charge to the committee and response 1a is the design mature enough to proceed to construct rc1 fully realistic designs of supports and aperture stop are needed for the single jaw thermal test and rc1 these are the hardest parts of the collimator mechanical design and should be validated by the single jaw and rc1 tests verification of ansys thermal model seems secondary to testing the supports as soon as possible 1b has impact of secondary collimators on collimation efficiency been adequately explored yes charge cont d 1c have alternative matls and designs been adequately explored many materials have been examined choice of cu is sound recommend considering a bimetallic strong back design with an inner water cooled steel cylinder and outer copper cylinder this has promise to reduce deflection during beam heating 1d is the proposed device likely to meet mechanical tolerances under the projected heat load unknown detailed designs of supports must be completed to evaluate this these is some question whether machining tolerances on the full length and circumference can meet the 25micron mechanical tolerance for the jaw opening charge cont d 1e comment on technical difficulties risks not foreseen and possible other approaches the following is a list of possible areas of risk that were not addressed at the review radiation damage diagnostics for damage and placement not addressed reliability of stepping motors bearings seizing sticking of collimator in closed position charge cont d 2 from an engineering perspective are there technical difficulties that would keep rc1 from meeting its requirements uncontrolled tilt of the collimator jaws with single point stop at the center hard to evaluate if mechanical tolerances can be met without detailed design of supports charge cont d 3a is the fabrication plan for the rc1 prototype reasonable it is difficult for us to evaluate realism of schedule in time that was available mechanical engineering effort needs to be increased by at least 1fte in order to complete the design and support rc1 tests 3b are the proposed tests adequate to answer performance questions yes however reliability issues have not been addressed charge cont d 3c are the proposed budget schedule and milestones adequate for building several prototypes proposed schedule is only has single jaw and rc1 prototypes rc2 is deliverable to cern in 2008 for beam test schedule does not allow for multiple rc1 rc2 design iterations if something doesn t work as planned if the tests indicate design iterations are needed this could well be a problem for the schedule other questions and comments are requirements clearly stated and complete requirements list exists but is too informal should have some written agreement suggestion is that the cdr be submitted to cern edms for review before doing this the unresolved design issues in sec 3.2 8 of the cdr should be addressed definition of project completion is well defined rc2 for beam test and full set of build to print drawings is integration with cern adequate communication with cern appears quite good important to continue close collaboration cern and slac efforts are complementary at this point competition is good but down selection is by one of the competitors cern have the required engineering resources been allocated need additional me support status see eric's talk where he will address specific concerns need to deal much more with the support stop issue then update rc1 cdr document get some sort of sign off from cern group that they agree hire additional engineer by april 1 begin single jaw tests as outlined in the document
