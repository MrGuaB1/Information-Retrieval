the lucretia project home page lucretialogo the lucretia project welcome to lucretia lucretia is a physics toolbox for the simulation of high performance single pass electron beam transport systems it is designed to support studies of linear collider low emittance transport bunch compressor linear accelerator final focus and also the transport and acceleration system of linac driven free electron lasers at this time lucretia is only available to run under matlab lucretia author list the original lucretia code was written by p tenenbaum pt at slac the current maintenance crew for lucretia are glen white slac national accelerator laboratory ca usa mark woodley slac national accelerator laboratory ca usa the management also gratefully acknowledges the assistance of paul emma tor raubenheimer andrei terebilo and andy wolski the authors originally got the idea for a beam dynamics code which was a library of functions rather than a self contained program from nick walker whom we mocked for it back in 1994 but in the end nick got the last laugh what's new last updated 21 sept 2011 downloads & source description setup instructions how it works philosophy etc matlab accelerator data elements beamline cell array girder cell array klystron structure ps structure power supplies wf structure wakefields interactions between beamline and other arrays supported element classes slices and blocks beam representation wakefields synchrotron radiation random numbers and seeds bpm and instrument readings script and function documentation function status and error message handling tracking trackthru and track r matrices getrmats and rmatatob twiss parameters gettwiss lattice generation lattice verification beam generation momentum profile management errors and misalignments tuning and analysis graphical user interface ground motion distributed parallel lucretia operations floodland handling of epics or aida control system interfaces for real world accelerator control internal arrangement of mexfile code other useful stuff deck parsing other useful stuff documentation examples benchmarking with tesla tdr linac known bugs whitegr 20 sept 2011 slac logo
