assignment 4 architecture and interiors assignment 4 architecture and interiors sandra sandra yen requirement 4 repeating patterns i love the architecture of the stanford school of medicine which is where this picture was taken i ve always noticed the repeated cut out patterns on the walls but i had never really paid attention to the ceilings of the hallways which are adorned with these square patterns seen in the top half of the photo i love the geometric shapes and repeated patterns represented all over the building on the walls on the ceiling and on the columns i took this picture by standing in the middle of an outdoor hallway near a column the thing on the upper left hand corner and i held my camera facing directly upward to snap this shot i love the ambiguity that leaves you wonderingowhich is the floor which is the wall which is the ceiling i took this picture with aperture priority and i set that to f 3.2 so i could get a decent amount of light the camera then set my exposure to 1 80 s i zoomed in a little bit so the focal length was 7.9 mm i used photoshop to adjust the contrast a little bit and to make the photo black and white the date under iphoto informationi that i took this picture is also completely wrong because my camera has not been set to the correct date and time sorry about that previous back to all photos next
