how to create a disjoint decomposition how to create a disjoint decomposition intoduction back next in this page we consider how to create disjoint classes you will create a disjoint decomposition of two of the subclasses of armored vehicle you should already be in taxonomy traversal mode if armored vehicle is highlighted on your screen and you can see its superclasses and subclasses then skip this step otherwise select cyc products armored vehicle from the taxonomy menu the display shows armored vehicle which is highlighted and the superclasses connecting it to the root you are going to create a disjoint decomposition of armored vehicle's subclasses heavy armored combat vehicle and lightly armored vehicle the first step is to select armored vehicle as the primary class however this has been done automatically the next step is to select the classes that you want to be in the disjoint decomposition highlight heavy armored combat vehicle by clicking on it next select lightly armored vehicle by clicking on it you are now ready to create a disjoint decomposition of armored vehicle involving its subclasses heavy armored combat vehicle and lightly armored vehicle select create disjoint decomposition from the decomposition menu the display now shows armored vehicle with heavy armored combat vehicle and lightly armored vehicle directly beneath it the green line beside heavy armored combat vehicle and lightly armored vehicle signifies that they are in a disjoint decomposition a solid black line separates the disjoint decomposition from the rest of the subclasses of armored vehicle in the next section you will learn how to add a class to an existing disjoint decompositioin intoduction back next
