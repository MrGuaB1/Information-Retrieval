rendering from compressed textures larger version tiff 1.1 mb rendering from compressed textures andrew c beers maneesh agrawala and navin chaddha proc siggraph 96 abstract we present a simple method for rendering directly from compressed textures in hardware and software rendering systems textures are compressed using a vector quantization vq method the advantage of vq over other compression techniques is that textures can be decompressed quickly during rendering the drawback of using lossy compression schemes such as vq for textures is that such methods introduce errors into the textures we discuss techniques for controlling these losses we also describe an extension to the basic vq technique for compressing mipmaps we have observed compression rates of up to 35 1 with minimal loss in visual quality and a small impact on rendering time the simplicity of our technique lends itself to an efficient hardware implementation additional information available paper without color figures postscript 86kb paper without color figures pdf 80kb color plate 1 tiff 966kb color plate 2 tiff 950kb according to university policy we have disclosed documentation of this invention to the office of technology licensing who have filed for a patent for further information contact john sandelin email jon otlmail stanford edu at the office of technology licensing beers cs stanford edu
