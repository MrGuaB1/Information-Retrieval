bone mineral density applet website introduction the applet below displays gender and ethnic specific curves for bone mineral density for whole body femoral neck total hip and lumbar spine l2 4 both areal bone mineral density bmd and estimates of volumetric bone mineral apparent density bmad are displayed bmad was calculated using bone area and bmc as described 1 these normative data were collected from a convenience sample of 423 healthy american youth ages 9 25 years enrolled in a longitudinal study of bone mineral acquisition details regarding the study cohort and protocol have been published 1 2 and 3 the sample included approximately equal numbers of asian hispanic white non hispanic white and black males and females bone mineral was measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry dxa qdr 1000w software version 6.1 hologic corp waltham ma in the pencil beam mode age and gender specific standard deviation scores z scores generated at this website apply only to data collected using similar dxa equipment and software when using these data to interpret scans from other densitometry equipment or software versions it will be necessary to correct for systematic differences in results as described 4 references bhudhikanok gs wang mc eckert k matkin c marcus r bachrach lk differences in bone mineral in young asian and caucasian americans may reflect differences in bone size j bone miner res 1996 11 1545 1556 wang mc aguirre m bhudhikanok gs kendall cg kirsch s marcus r bachrach lk bone mass and hip axis length in healthy asian black hispanic and white american youths j bone miner res 1997 12 1922 1935 bachrach lk hastie t wang mc narasimhan b marcus r bone mineral acquisition in healthy asian hispanic black and caucasian youth a longitudinal study j clin endocrinol metab in print genant hk universal standardization for dual x ray absorptiometry patient and phantom cross calibration results j bone miner res 1995 10 997 998 disclaimer this website was developed as a service to disseminate information to the medical research community and not for clinical diagnostic purposes appropriate interpretation of bone densitometry results in children requires consideration of other clinical factors that may influence the results such as bone size and skeletal maturation interpretatation of bone densitometry should be provided by a medical professional any individual seeking diagnostic or treatment opinions must consult his or her own physician questions concerning website operation can be addressed to laura bachrach lkbach stanford edu md division of pediatric endocrinology stanford university school of medicine authors this is joint work of laura bachrach trevor j hastie and balasubramanian narasimhan notes on applet use gender and ethnic specific age adjusted standard deviation scores z scores for areal bmd and volumetric bmad bone mineral density can be derived using the curves provided by following these steps select the sex skeletal site and ethnicity of the subject to compute the z score enter the age and areal bone density bmd or volumetric bone density bmad for the subject in the fields provided and hit enter values outside the expected range will not generate a response the z score will appear in the designated box and the results plotted on the graph more than one data point can be entered on the same subject by entering the age bmd or bmad results followed by the enter key serial age bone density and z score data will be listed in the box to the right of the z score serial data points will be plotted on the graph buttons are available to clear all added points remove a highlighted point in the box and print if you wish to compare a number of plots on the same scale you can use the options button to fix the x and y axis ranges to desired limits pressing the button will pop up a dialog box where you can set the limits among other things the plots can be optionally annotated with a name of a subject to do this fill in the fields for the last name middle initial and the first name and hit the enter key if you want to generate a report suitable for printing press the print button the result will be a new web page that contains a snapshot of the graph as well as a table of the z scores this page can be printed as usual by using the print button of your browser printing can be quite slow depending on the speed of your connection especially with modem connections to compute z score results for additional subjects press the clear button and return to step 1 above this applet has been tested with the latest versions of netscape version 4.7 and internet explorer version 4 and higher although it should work with versions at most a year old if you run into trouble with even the latest versions please see the troubleshooting page the applet last modified mon oct 18 17 29 16 pdt 1999
