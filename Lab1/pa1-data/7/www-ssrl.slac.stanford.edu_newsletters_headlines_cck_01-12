ssrl headlines january 2012 ssrl headline news a monthly publication from ssrl director chi chang kao ssrl takes on the frontiers of materials science as we at ssrl continue to refine our five to ten year strategic plan our materials science goals are becoming increasingly clear advanced materials are at the heart of our technically driven society and recent advances in theory computation power materials synthesis and characterization tools have brought the goal of materials by design within reach synchrotron light sources with their exceptional properties play a critical role in the materials by design process providing the powerful characterization capabilities required by the materials research community the ssrl materials science program is focused on several specific areas within materials sciences where we can have the most important impact first we will provide and develop a comprehensive set of tools and methodologies in support of the national materials genome initiative focusing in particular on materials for sustainable energy as identified in the slac energy strategy second we will provide and develop tools and methodologies to understand the wide range of phenomena emerging from complex systems in particular strongly correlated electron materials such as high temperature superconductors as well as the magnetic materials and semiconductors needed for emerging consumer products special emphasis will be given to the following areas enhancing in situ real time capabilities for the study of the relationship between structure and function in materials material responses under extreme conditions as well as material synthesis and processing developing tools and integrated approaches to probe materials on multiple length scales and time scales including those made possible by spear3's high repetition rate pump probe low alpha mode coupling experimental techniques closely to theory and modeling developing high throughput rapid access characterization capabilities we will broaden the impact of ssrl through partnerships with a large number of institutions in sustainable energy materials research including many energy frontier research centers erfcs for example the center for inverse design the national renewable energy laboratory and stanford's precourt institute for energy in many cases ssrl hosts efrc affiliated students and postdoctoral researchers with ssrl staff acting as mentors for the young researchers we will also closely coordinate with other department of energy office of science user facilities to enhance industrial research and advance initiatives supported by the doe technology offices such as the bay area photovoltaic consortium bapvc which is supported by the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy finally in close collaboration with stanford university and through introductory workshops for new synchrotron users one on one mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students and a dedicated materials science teaching beam line we will carry on ssrl's long tradition of educating and training the next generation of scientists and engineers this article originally appeared in the january 2012 edition of ssrl headline news questions please contact kelen tuttle
