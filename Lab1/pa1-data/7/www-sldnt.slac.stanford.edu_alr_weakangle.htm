plots summary of weak mixing angle measurements at cern and slac measurements of the weak mixing angle by 4 lep experiments combined at cern and the sld experiment at slac the sld result is shown in light blue and the other measurements are from cern the error bars shown for the measurements represent 1 standard deviation leptonic results are determined from asymmetry measurements in the production of z 0 particles from polarized electron positron collisions sld's a l measurement and from lep's asymmetry measurements in z 0 decays to pairs of leptons electron pairs muon pairs and tau pairs the a fb 0 l and a t and a e measurements these leptonic results are consistent with each other forward backward asymmetry measurements in z 0 decays to pairs of quarks can also be used to determine the weak mixing angle the quark asymmetry measurements are a fb 0 b a fb 0 c and q fb in the above plot and they also are self consistent but the leptonic results differ significantly by 3.5 standard deviations from the hadronic results the reason for this discrepancy could be a statistical fluctuation an experimental technique problem or perhaps a sign of new physics last updated 04 09 2001
