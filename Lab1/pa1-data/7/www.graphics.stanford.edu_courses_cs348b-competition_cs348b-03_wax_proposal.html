cs348b final project proposal jonathan huang physically based rendering of stone statues with translucence final rendering project proposal jonathan huang click here to go to the final project page in this project i hope to gain an understanding of the subsurface scattering phenomenon particularly in stone this phenomenon is captured in a bssrdf which is simply a generalization of a brdf in the brdf we have the restriction that outgoing light must leave at the same point that incoming light enters a surface not so with the bssrdf subsurface scattering occurs everywhere in nature in fact all non metallic materials are to some degree translucent translucence manifests itself in a very beautiful way in stone statues especially with materials such as jade or marble my goals are to implement this in lrt and use a photon mapping method to render it as described in henrik wann jensen's book if all is successful and i have time i hope to also add functionality so that the stone can be rendered when wet here are some example images the first two are photographs and the others are rendered using a bssrdf model some papers that will be useful a practical model for subsurface light transport henrik wann jensen steve marschner marc levoy and pat hanrahan proceedings of siggraph 2001 pages 511 518 los angeles august 2001 a rapid hierarchical rendering technique for translucent materials henrik wann jensen and juan buhler proceedings of siggraph 2002 pages 576 581 san antonio july 2002 rendering of wet materials henrik wann jensen justin legakis and julie dorsey rendering techniques 99 eds d lischinski and gw larson springer verlag pages 273 282 1999 modeling and rendering of weathered stone julie dorsey alan edelman henrik wann jensen justin legakis and hans kohling pedersen proceedings of siggraph 99 pages 225 234 los angeles august 1999
