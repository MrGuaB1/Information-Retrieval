nano center gift honors giant in the study of the miniscule thestanfordchallenge stanford edu page 1 fall 2008 nano center gift honors giant in the study of the miniscule the center for nanoscale science and technology slated to open in the fall of 2009 promises to keep stanford a big name in the study of the very small stanford has been a world leader in nanoscale research ever since calvin quate the leland t edwards professor of engineering and of applied physics emeritus helped create the field as a co inventor of the atomic force microscope two decades ago able to resolve objects the size of an atom the device is now used around the world and even beyond as a tool in space exploration so when don caddes ms 62 phd 67 and his wife sheila made a gift to the new nano center it was perhaps only fitting they wanted part of it to go toward the construction of a conference facility in honor of quate caddes had always been struck by quate's ability to bring people together to tackle problems he's an inspiring guy says caddes he's the antithesis of the lonely scientist image that a lot of lay people have research is about bouncing ideas off each other inspiring each other quate is just a master of that caddes has known quate since he was a graduate student in the latter's lab four decades ago even then quate was a well known scientist noted for his early work on microwave tubes and caddes was eager to work with him i ended up being his first phd student to graduate says caddes with a laugh that's my only claim to fame in the research arena since graduating caddes's claims to fame in other arenas include executive positions in half a dozen medical device start ups one of which developed a now ubiquitous intravenous pump he also spent eight years as president and chief operating officer of accuray manufacturers of the cyberknife a noninvasive radiosurgery robot invented by john r adler jr a professor of neurosurgery at stanford caddes's career has made him keenly aware of the importance of cutting edge research of the kind conducted all around him when he was a student at stanford's edward l ginzton laboratory the nano center will be modeled after the ginzton lab renowned over the last 50 years for a seemingly endless flood of innovations in microwave and radiation technology lasers superconductors fiber optics biomedical imaging and much more caddes saw making a gift to the nano center as a way of perpetuating what he calls the mystique of the ginzton lab the nano center will enable science and technology research at the nanoscale a billionth of a meter some researchers are even working with and fabricating individual atoms the center will be used by researchers throughout the university and has the potential to advance any number of disciplines potential applications for the research range from new drugs to new semiconductors from faster dna sequencing to better communication networks from high efficiency solar cells to super strong fibers thestanfordchallenge stanford edu 2011 stanford university all rights reserved stanford benefactor is a publication of the office of development contact stanfordbenefactor stanford edu professor emeritus cal quate ms 47 phd 50 left has been honored through a gift from former student don caddes ms 62 phd 67
