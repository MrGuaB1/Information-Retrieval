drosophila e coli plasmid vector phs85 incomplete hsp82 neo phs85 vector ig sequence link general plasmid ds dna 9600 bp functions transfection expression thermoinducible selection copy number hosts drosophila suppliers misc comments p transposable integrating shuttle vector contains hsp82 neo fusion gene which encodes the first 20 aa of d pseudoobscura hsp82 5 codons in a linker fused to the fifth codon of bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase from tn5 and followed by polyadenylation signals from d melanogaster hsp82 also contains an 868 bp hsp82 promoter regulating the hsp82 neo fusion gene and a 102 bp multiple cloning site between the polyadenylation signal and the inverted repeats of p element ppi25 1 expression is constitutive but can be increased with heat selection of transgenic drosophila by g418 has been done with embryos larvae and adults can be used in drosophila spp cell culture transfection assays and may function in other animal and plant systems because the hsp82 promoter is highly conserved deposited by hg sass growth media lb plus ampicillin atcc medium number 1227 37c parents p element d pseudoobscura d melanogaster phs85 siblings descendents ncbi entrez link return to vector homepage
