the role of the cmb prior page 1 the role of the cmb prior cmb provides a ight prior probability distribuion funcion on other parameters used in the fit for w and associated parameters this informaion is generally disseminated to the community as markov chains is this sufficient for low z dark energy probes planck plans to release tools to allow the community to work with the likelihoods how will the community use this ability nuisance parameters not usually included in the markov chains if they are independent each experiment can internally marginalize how do we check this do we need the cmb community to provide more informaion on its nuisance parameters agreed that this would be good but a recogniion of the difficulty often very difficult to generically include in analysis if the community needs to interface with the cmb data at a lower level how can funding be secured to support the infrastructure needed for the cmb community to provide the necessary tools an issue especially for sub orbital and ground based experiments generic problem for big science projects in astronomy we need to find our comfort level that compromises between a desire for independent analysis with our ability to provide the necessary infrastructure page 2 new physics from the cmb the current dark energy constraints from cmb assume no isocurvature or non gaussianity this may change in the future cmb provides a high precision measurement of the density fluctuaions at early ime this includes but is not limited to the primordial power spectrum of maer if new features appear isocurvature or non gaussianity for example they will need to be included in low redshift fits currently delta funcion priors for these effects is the low redshift community equipped with the right tools to include this effect if it becomes important does this make nbody fast an even harder problem page 3 role of the cmb as a direct dark energy probe isw is not expected to be sensiive enough to play a major role in the field lensing of the cmb provides an anchor point for the effects of dark energy as a funcion of redshift need large numbers of detectors with telesccope apertures of a few meters ground based limitaions likely to be instrumental not astrophysical muliple experiments are good also muliple wavelengths dedicated foreground experiments cross correlate with low z maer distribuion page 4
