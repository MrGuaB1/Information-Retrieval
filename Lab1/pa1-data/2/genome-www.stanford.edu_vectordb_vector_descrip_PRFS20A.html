e coli plasmid vector prfs20a incomplete lac promoter at arac 5 prfs20a vector ig sequence link general plasmid ds dna 166 bp functions cloning selection copy number hosts e coli suppliers misc comments hypersynthesis of arac protein has been accomplished by deleting some of the 5 noncoding dna in front of the arac gene and inserting a 95 bp lac fragment containing the promoter and the ribosome binding site the level of the arac protein was increased 5000 times over that in the wild type gene hypersynthesis however does not require the lac ribosome binding site apparently a sequence already present in front of the arac gene ggag base pairs 144 147 can serve as an efficient binding site clone prfs13 another clone that causes hypersynthesis of the arac protein and includes the lac ribosome binding site appears in another entry ncbi gi 207982 parents prfs10 prfs11 pgl101 from plj3 siblings prfs13 prfs15 descendents ncbi entrez link return to vector homepage
