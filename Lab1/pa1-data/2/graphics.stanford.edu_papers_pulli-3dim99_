multiview registration for large datasets multiview registration for large datasets kari pulli second international conference on 3d digital imaging and modeling abstract in this paper we present a multiview registration method for aligning range data we first align scans pairwise with each other and use the pairwise alignments as constraints that the multiview step enforces while evenly diffusing the pairwise registration errors this approach is especially suitable for registering large data sets since using constraints from pairwise alignments does not require loading the entire data set into memory to perform the alignment the alignment method is efficient and it is less likely to get stuck into a local minimum than previous methods and can be used in conjunction with any pairwise method based on aligning overlapping surface sections additional information available pdf version of the paper 162k compressed postscript version of the paper 417k
