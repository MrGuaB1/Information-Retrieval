icrafter icrafter a service framework for ubiquitous computing environments shankar r ponnekanti brian lee armando fox pat hanrahan and terry winograd ubicomp 2001 abstract in this paper we propose icrafter a framework for services and their user interfaces in a class of ubiquitous computing environments the chief objective of icrafter is to let users flexibly interact with the services in their environment using a variety of modalities and input devices we extend existing service frameworks in three ways first to offload services and user input devices icrafter provides infrastructure support for ui selection generation and adaptation second icrafter allows uis to be associated with service patterns for on the fly aggregation of services finally icrafter facilitates the design of service uis that are portable but still reflect the context of the local environment in addition we also focus on the system properties such as incremental deployability and robustness that are critical for ubiquitous computing environments we describe the goals and architecture of icrafter a prototype implementation that validates its design and the key lessons learnt from our experiences this paper is copyright 2001 by springer verlag and will appear in the notes in computer science series along with other papers from ubicomp 2001 pdf format 570 kb gzipped postscript 505 kb talk slides 715 kb
