introduction to advanced coal page 1 introduction to advanced coal worldwide coal fired power plants contribute to approximately 25 of the world's primary energy but impart 40 of the co2 emissions coal resources are widely distributed worldwide inexpensive and used extensively for electric power generation in the us china and india for example as a result the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with use of coal is a significant one in recent decades most of the attention on advanced coal combustion has shifted from university based research to private sector development therefore gcep is interested in advanced coal research that addresses conceptual approaches to coal conversion that go beyond incremental improvements towards systems and processes that emphasize co2 emission reductions gcep currently supports a program on coal energy conversion with aquifer based sequestration led by professor reginald mitchell the process involves co2 capture in inherently stable forms through supercritical oxidation of coal in aquifer derived water the products of reaction including co2 are returned in the aqueous solvent to the aquifer the research includes systems analysis materials reactor and combustor development and aquifer compatibility
