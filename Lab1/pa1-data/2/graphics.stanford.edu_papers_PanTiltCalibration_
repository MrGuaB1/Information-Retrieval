spacetime stereo calibrating pan tilt cameras in wide area surveillance networks james davis xing chen pan tilt cameras are often used as components of wide area surveillance systems it is necessary to cali brate these cameras in relation to one another in order to obtain a consistent representation of the entire space existing methods for calibrating pan tilt cameras have assumed an idealized model of camera mechanics in ad dition most methods have been calibrated using only a small range of camera motion this paper presents a method for calibrating pan tilt cameras that introduces a more complete model of cam era motion pan and tilt rotations are modeled as occur ring around arbitrary axes in space in addition the wide area surveillance system itself is used to build a large virtual calibration object resulting in better calibration than would be possible with a single small calibration target finally the proposed enhancements are validated experimentally with comparisons showing the improve ment provided over more traditional methods iccv 2003 paper pantiltcalib_iccv2003 pdf
