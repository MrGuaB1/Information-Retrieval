brook for gpus stream computing on graphics hardware brook for gpus stream computing on graphics hardware ian buck tim foley daniel horn jeremy sugerman kayvon fatahalian mike houston and pat hanrahan computer science department stanford university to appear at siggraph 2004 abstract in this paper we present brook for gpus a system for general purpose computation on programmable graphics hardware brook extends c to include simple data parallel constructs enabling the use of the gpu as a streaming coprocessor we present a compiler and runtime system that abstracts and virtualizes many aspects of graphics hardware in addition we present an analysis of the effectiveness of the gpu as a compute engine compared to the cpu to determine when the gpu can outperform the cpu for a particular algorithm we evaluate our system with five applications the saxpy and sgemv blas operators image segmentation fft and ray tracing for these applications we demonstrate that our brook implementations perform comparably to hand written gpu code and up to seven times faster than their cpu counterparts paper pdf presentation pdf
