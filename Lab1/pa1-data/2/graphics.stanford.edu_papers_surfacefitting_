fitting smooth surfaces to dense polygon meshes fitting smooth surfaces to dense polygon meshes venkat krishnamurthy and marc levoy proc siggraph 96 abstract recent progress in acquiring shape from range data permits the acquisition of seamless million polygon meshes from physical models in this paper we present an algorithm and system for converting dense irregular polygon meshes of arbitrary topology into tensor product b spline surface patches with accompanying displacement maps this choice of representation yields a coarse but efficient model suitable for animation and a fine but more expensive model suitable for rendering the first step in our process consists of interactively painting patch boundaries over a rendering of the mesh in many applications interactive placement of patch boundaries is considered part of the creative process and is not amenable to automation the next step is gridded resampling of each bounded section of the mesh our resampling algorithm lays a grid of springs across the polygon mesh then iterates between relaxing this grid and subdividing it this grid provides a parameterization for the mesh section which is initially unparameterized finally we fit a tensor product b spline surface to the grid we also output a displacement map for each mesh section which represents the error between our fitted surface and the spring grid these displacement maps are images hence this representation facilitates the use of image processing operators for manipulating the geometric detail of an object they are also compatible with modern photo realistic rendering systems our resampling and fitting steps are fast enough to surface a million polygon mesh in under 10 minutes important for an interactive system explanation of the figure above the figure at the top of this page summarizes the paper moving from left to right in the image we start with the raw dense polygonal model leftmost which in this case came from 75 scans of an action figure it has over 350000 polygons we first paint boundary lines on this model this is shown in the figure that is second from the left we use this information to automatically grid see paper each patch here is a close up shot of an intermediate stage of this gridding the third figure from the left shows a split view the left half is a set of spline approximations for the relevant patches and some associated displacement maps the right half shows the polygonal model the rightmost figure shows a split view with the left half being the displacement mapped spline patches the right half once again being the polygonal model additional information paper in acrobat format with medium resolution color figures 3 mb uncompressed paper in postscript with low resolution color figures 679 kb compressed paper in postscript with medium resolution color figures 1.227 mb compressed figures from the paper jpeg image of figure 5 jpeg image of figure 8 jpeg image of figure 11 jpeg image of figure 12 jpeg image of figure 13 the captions for these figures can be found in the paper you can also read the captions here and finally a more distinct image corresponding to figure 11d the technical academy award after leaving stanford venkat krishnamurthy co founded paraform technologies with brian kissel to commercial the ideas in his dissertation in 2001 paraform was awarded a technical achievement award by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for developement of the paraform digital form development software by then his software had been used on a number of movies including lake placid the haunting hollowman end of days and minority report as of this writing 2003 paraform has been bought by metris international and his software continues to be sold and used in the entertainment and manufacturing industries this historical note written by marc levoy this page copyright 1996 by venkat krishnamurthy the paper copyright 1996 by acm venkat cs stanford edu
