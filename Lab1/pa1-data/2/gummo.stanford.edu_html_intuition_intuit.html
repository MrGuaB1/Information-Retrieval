synthesis curriculum engineering intuition synthesis curriculum engineering intuition this project is sponsored by the nsf synthesis coalition can engineering intuition be reliably developed this project explores environments and experiences for developing engineering intuition a feel for hardware and engineering concepts an appreciation of physical quantities motivation to explore and question confidence in design research goals understand the nature of contextual learning and the development of intuition develop requirements for software tools to support engineering work teaching goals increase engagement in the curriculum by motivating students with interesting realistic challenging experiences develop robust theoretical understanding and engineering intuition by exploring analysis in the context of synthesis develop confidence through competence in analysis and synthesis develop learning processes that transfer to the workplace margot brereton brereton sunrise stanford edu
