holistic biology voyage in 1940 john steinbeck and ed ricketts led a voyage to the sea of cortez sea of cortez was published a year later and included both steinbeck's account of the memorable voyage and ricketts's scientific review of their findings 64 years later professors gilly baxter and shillinglaw led another expedition to update steinbeck and ricketts's voyage both in public awareness and scientifically that voyage in turn inspired the holistic biology program which began in 2005 and had its first field component in mexico in 2006 now in 2008 we re going to go again why go on such an expedition one of the reasons we gave ourselves for this trip and when we used this reason we called the trip an expedition was to observe the distribution of invertebrates to see and to record their kinds and numbers how they lived together what they ate and how they reproduced that plan was simple straight forward and only a part of the truth but we did tell the truth to ourselves we were curious our curiosity was not limited but was as wide and horizonless as that of darwin or agassiz or linnaeus or pliny we wanted to see everything our eyes would accommodate to think what we could and out of our seeing and thinking to build some kind of structure in modeled imitation of the observed reality steinbeck & ricketts sea of cortez 1941 this course will attempt to satisfy the goals of the1940 voyage both in the simple straight forward elements of biology and in the unlimited bounds of curiosity itinerary and highlights day numbers are on map we start with an overland journey visiting missions at san javier and loreto and squid fishing operations in santa rosalia we will also investigate the local geology of santa rosalia once a major copper producer and the nearby volcanoes tres virgenes we are negotiating the production a video chronicle of the class tagging a squid with the journal of visualized experiments http www myjove com we then return to la paz for an intertidal survey on isla espiritu santu a site visited by ricketts and steinbeck in 1940 and visit el triunfo in the sierra de la laguna and cabo pulmo the world's northernmost hard coral reef day 1 4 26 flight to los cabos transport to la paz day 2 4 27 overland to loreto day 3 4 28 san javier mission and transport to santa rosalia day 4 5 4 29 30 santa rosalia san ignacio squid fishery and geology day 6 5 1 overland to la paz day 7 5 2 baja expeditions pangas to punta lobos for intertidal transect day 8 5 3 el triunfo and cabo pulmo day 9 5 4 la paz a week at sea will follow during which we will cross the gulf in search of humboldt squid and marine mammals particularly sperm whales we will also document relevant oceanographic properties and dynamic features of acoustic scattering layers we will be accompanied by mexican squid and whale scientists as a research team we will work with national geographic remote imaging to deploy a crittercam on a free swimming humboldt squid http www nationalgeographic com crittercam index html and hope to document the effort as part of the collaboration with the journal of visualized experiments day 10 16 5 5 11 la paz to farallon de san ignacio to puerto escondido we will make a personnel change stop at puerto escondido where we will be joined by susan shillinglaw chuck baxter and other invertebrate biologists on a return to nearshore and terrestrial environments we will search for the endemic rattle less rattlesnake on rugged isla santa catalina and also survey subtidal fish communities and rocky intertidal fauna we then move to the remote santa marta region on the baja coast from there we will carry out surveys of the rocky intertidal at two nearby sites as part of our monitoring program and visit the remote fishing village of agua verde we will finish up the intertidal surveys at isla cayo the burned site of steinbeck and ricketts that we found to be full of life in our 2004 expedition our last outing will be an exploration snorkel and kayak of a rich mangrove system full of fish at amortajada on isla san jose day 17 19 5 12 14 isla santa catalina day 20 23 5 15 18 santa marta punta marcial punta san francisco agua verde day 24 5 19 isla cayo and amortajada isla san jose day 25 5 20 la paz day 26 5 21 flight to california
