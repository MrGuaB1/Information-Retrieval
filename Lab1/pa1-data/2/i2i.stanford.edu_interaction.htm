i2i interactions with scientists an international environmental science collaboration home challenges activities carbon footprints ocean acidification critical thinking group projects interactions with scientists social network about our team funding contact partners current partners sister projects join us perspectives interactions with scientists we at i2i feel that there is too often a divide between the so called expert scientists and everyone else inlcuding students teachers and citizens furthermore we suspect that much of the controversy surrounding well established scientific theories such as evolutionary theory and the greenhouse effect theory can be traced to this same divide between scientists and the public effective communication in both directions can help reverse this unfortunate situation it is a major goal of i2i to give students thje opportunity to interact directly and indirectly with scientists face to face interactions of this kind are of course invaluable but the success of the i2i concept depends upon facilitating meaningful interactions between scientists and students in a virtual context our staff scientists are the primary scientist contacts that the i2i students have and the students have ongoing opportunities to interact with our staff scientists through the ning page email and stixy our scientists also provide indirect contact with the students through working closely with their teachers helping plan curriculum implementation designing and iteratively updating & improving our activities and answering questions one of our scientific collaborators dr sam dupont created a voicethread based upon his research on ocean acidification posted here as well as on the ning site now students can have a look at the talk at any time learning at their own pace and having ongoing discussions on the topic with other students and i2i team members including dr dupont since swedish students can feel a bit insecure and shy with their english this tool gives them time to formulate their comments record them if they wish rehear edit and decide whether to delete or to publish them in coming years we will add additional voicethreads from other scientists not directly involved in the project thus expanding the range of contacts that the students can have with the scientific community during the students group project research our staff encourages students to make email contact directly to scientists who are experts in the areas that the students are researching most students don t realize that these kinds of contacts are even possible but our experience is that the vast majority of research scientists are quite happy to answer questions about their research that students may have all of these modes of scientist student contact make the project more tangible to the students and i2i colleagues and result in strengthened relationships among all of us furthermore these more personal and in depth interactions are of great help in providing students a deeper understanding of complex scientific issues finally these kinds of interchanges are important mechanisms for lowering the artifical wall that often exists between scientist and citizen at the same time as being empowering for our students
