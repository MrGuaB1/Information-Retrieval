undergraduates discover 21st century biology thestanfordchallenge stanford edu page 1 winter 2011 undergraduates discover 21st century biology by grace hammerstrom at stanford the core experimental biology lab courses for undergraduates biology 44x and 44y have been pretty predictable classes for the most part students do classic yet standardized lab activities all following the same steps to a known conclusion too many students graduate without experiencing real science says patricia chandler seawell 70 who majored in biology herself as a stanford undergrad science is exploration the process is what's important that's what i m excited about today seawell works as the coordinator of a curriculum redesign that is changing how science is taught at stanford she is also one of its biggest supporters in honor of her 40th reunion celebrated in october she committed $1 million to the school of humanities and sciences to help revamp undergraduate core lab classes and invite innovation for the first five years her gift targets a project dubbed biology for the 21st century the new curriculum takes a discovery based approach to science students in the pilot sections of bio 44x and 44y adapt a series of experiments that reveal a logical approach to explore one question answer unknown over the course of 10 weeks they use established scientific protocols such as recombination biology in yeast dna sequencing data analysis protein tagging and polymerase chain reaction to achieve their answers in the winter quarter which focuses on molecular biology students are given normal and mutant oncogenes in a yeast model system and asked to discover how the corresponding cancerous proteins fail to function in the spring ecology and evolution lab students observe and analyze a floral population at jasper ridge and harvest the nectar to determine what types and amounts of yeast are present providing clues about how abiotic and biotic factors affect community assemblage in fact guiding individual students through these thought provoking experiments requires additional preparation and hands on teaching and stanford has hired a full time phd to help with this the program launched last year it's expanding to more sections this quarter and in spring 2011 seawell brings years of experience to the effort she has spent her entire career in science teaching high school working as a research assistant at stanford and the university of hawaii and bringing innovative curricula to high schools through her work at gene connection a san mateo county based outreach program that aims to improve student literacy in science and biotechnology today being back in a stanford lab feels like coming home seawell expects the impact of her gift to reach beyond the sciences science is a process of logic and creativity of coming up with ideas and then figuring out how to validate or invalidate those ideas she explains we want to ground students in real science so that whatever discipline they study they bring some of that thought process with them thestanfordchallenge stanford edu 2011 stanford university all rights reserved stanford benefactor is a publication of the office of development contact stanfordbenefactor stanford edu above stanford biology students tag hummingbirds at jasper ridge to track the types and amounts of yeast in local floral nectar right patricia seawell 70 is helping to redesign how science is taught at stanford photos angela drury
