distributed rendering for scalable displays distributed rendering for scalable displays greg humphreys ian buck matthew eldridge and pat hanrahan stanford university appears in the proceedings of supercomputing 2000 abstract we describe a novel distributed graphics system that allows an application to render to a large tiled display our system called wiregl uses a cluster of off the shelf pcs connected with a high speed network wiregl allows an unmodified existing application to achieve scalable output resolution on such a display this paper presents an efficient sorting algorithm which minimizes the network traffic for a scalable display we will demonstrate that for most applications our system provides scalable output resolution with minimal performance impact paper adobe pdf format 800k compressed postscript 2.2 mb greg humphreys
