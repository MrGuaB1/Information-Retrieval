these programs are useful for analyzing abf data files wdetecta is a spontaneous psc detector that will read an abf file and output a scan strathclyde electrophysiology software file with each detected event in an individual sweep wscnselect is a spontaneous event filter that will take the scan file from above and based on predetermined criteria select a subset of events and export them to an episodic abf file wgn is a white gaussian noise generator useful for making templates to read into clampex for stimulus waveforms it can make noisy waves periodic waves repetitive short pulse trains and even chirps thinscnw takes a text file and combines adjacent rows into local means useful for take spontaneous psc event files and converting them into binned eg every 5 seconds local means for amplitude frequency etc wcombine will combine two or more abf files in interesting ways
