welcome to inquiry to insight an international environmental science collaboration home challenges activities carbon footprints ocean acidification critical thinking group projects interactions with scientists social network about our team funding contact partners current partners sister projects join us perspectives our vision environmental problems are both global and local in scope with important issues such as climate change transcending all boundaries effective solutions to these problems will require communication among countries in particular climate change issues are of growing concern for the first time in human history we are aware that we can impact our environment on a planetary scale it is imperative that the next generation of policy makers educators and citizens understand the causes and undertake effective solutions to these challenges the inquiry to insight project i2i addresses these issues in a innovative manner by offering an educational program combining various digital tools in the context of international collaboration the i2i concept involves international collaboration in a common language to learn about discuss and envision solutions to shared environmental challenges this international collaboration gives students the opportunity to compare views attitudes and life styles related to environmental issues and to broaden their points of view the online communication aspect allows the students to interact across borders in a context with which they are both adept and quite familiar we are entering the third year of our full study period where we will be updating our curricula related to ocean acidification and carbon footprint analysis links below we have also just started a limited test of an exciting new interactive student collaborative project the international student carbon footprint challenge follow the links below to explore our activities and resources if you like what you see contact us to become a partner in our international projects digital resources carbon footprint direct link to the footprint calculator ocean acidification direct link to the acid ocean activity and virtual lab student assignments critical thinking student collaboration i2i news wire 11 2011 preparations underway for our next full international carbon footprint challenge project session two november 2011 10 13 10 14 2011 i2i team members pam miller & jason hodin and einztein ceo marco masoni present on iscfc and miller & hodin speak on acid ocean at the national association of biology teachers annual meeting in anaheim ca usa 09 15 2011 students worldwide participate in our full international carbon footprint challenge project session one september 2011 09 07 2011 i2i team posts update to our international student carbon footprint calculator 04 2011 i2i partners with einztein com to pilot test our international carbon footprint challenge project 02 21 2011 i2i face to face meeting at hopkins marine station pacific grove ca usa 01 24 2011 updated version of i2i carbon footprint calculator posted with more accurate international food footprint data 01 2011 i2i team publishes book chapter on our ocean acidification curriculum in the economic social and political elements of climate change
