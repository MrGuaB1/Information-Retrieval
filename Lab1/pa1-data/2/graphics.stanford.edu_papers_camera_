a realistic camera model for computer graphics a realistic camera model for computer graphics craig kolb don mitchell and pat hanrahan computer graphics proceedings of siggraph 95 acm siggraph 1995 pp 317 324 abstract most recent rendering research has concentrated on two subproblems modeling the reflection of light from materials and calculating the direct and indirect illumination from light sources and other surfaces another key component of a rendering system is the camera model unfortunately current camera models are not geometrically or radiometrically correct and thus are not sufficient for synthesizing images from physically based rendering programs in this paper we describe a physically based camera model for computer graphics more precisely a physically based camera model accurately computes the irradiance on the film given the incoming radiance from the scene in our model a camera is described as a lens system and film backplane the lens system consists of a sequence of simple lens elements stops and apertures the camera simulation module computes the irradiance on the backplane from the scene radiances using distributed ray tracing this is accomplished by a detailed simulation of the geometry of ray paths through the lens system and by sampling the lens system such that the radiometry is computed accurately and efficiently because even the most complicated lenses have a relatively small number of elements the simulation only increases the total rendering time slightly additional information postscript version of paper with low res color figures 5.5 mb high resolution color figures figure 8 671kb figure 9 615kb figure 10 194kb figure 12 581kb last update 18 september 1995 cek graphics stanford edu
