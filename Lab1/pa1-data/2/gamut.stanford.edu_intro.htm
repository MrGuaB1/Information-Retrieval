gamut welcome to gamut gamut is a suite of game generators designated for testing game theoretic algorithms with gamut instances of games from thirty five base game classes can be easily generated using different parameterization options it is possible to randomize over countless distributions of games resulting in a comprehensive test bed for any algorithm requiring a normal form game as input gamut is not to be confused with gambit a library of game theory software and tools for the construction and analysis of finite extensive and normal form games gamut is made to be used in collaboration with gambit development of the gamut testbed was supported by darpa's transfer learning program through grant n00173 05 1 g033
