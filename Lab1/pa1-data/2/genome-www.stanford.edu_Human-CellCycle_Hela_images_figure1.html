human cell cycle hela cells figures figure 1 figure 1 synchrony of hela cells a cells were arrested at the beginning of s phase using a double thymidine block and cell synchrony monitored by flow cytometry of propidium iodide stained cells flow cytometry data were collected for each of the three independent double thymidine blocks performed in this study data are shown only for the second double thymidine arrest thy thy2 although equivalent synchrony was obtained in each of the three experiments the number of cells arbitrary units is plotted against dna content for time points at four hour intervals for 44 hrs an arrow indicates the time of mitosis as estimated from the flow cytometry data upon release from the thymidine block more than 95 of the cells progressed into s phase 0 4hrs entered g2 phase 5 6hrs underwent a synchronous mitosis at 7 8 hrs and reentered s phase after completing one full cell cycle at 14 16 hrs typically two to three additional synchronous cell cycles were obtained b cells were arrested in mitosis by blocking first in thymidine followed by release and then blocking in nocodazole after release from the nocodazole block most of the cells 75 divided synchronously within two hours of release from the arrest entered s phase by 10 12 hrs after release and completed the next synchronous mitosis by 18 20 hrs ultimately completing two full cell cycles c cells were selected by mitotic shake off and the percentage of cells in s phase was measured by 5 bromo 2 deoxyuridine brdu incorporation the percent of cells in s phase is plotted against the time after plating more than 95 of the cells entered s phase by 12 hrs
