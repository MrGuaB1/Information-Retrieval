cs 348b spring 2002 rendering competition cs 348b spring 2002 rendering competition these images were created for the rendering competition in pat hanrahan's cs 348b class image synthesis techniques in the spring quarter of 2002 mike cammarano was the ta the judges for the competition were greg humphreys from the stanford graphics lab steve worley from worley labs first prize vase by georg petschnigg and inam ur rahman malik georg and inam measured the reflective and transmissive properties of a real vase and then applied these texture maps to modulate the material properties of their rendered stand in they then used photon mapping to reproduce the intricate caustics associated with their subject be sure to check out their gallery more info second prize digital sculpture by robert bridson robert created a sculpting tool to manipulate surfaces represented by levelsets he also built tools for stitching photographs together into a panoramic environment map allowing him to immerse his synthetic sculpture in a real scene more info honorable mentions igloo by farhan zaidi and irfan zaidi the honorable mention for most beautiful picture and most recent research used was given to farhan and irfan for their scene of an igloo beneath the night sky it uses recent techniques in simulating subsurface scattering and modeling the night sky more info mirages by niloy mitra and gaurav garg the honorable mention for best presentation was given to niloy and gaurav for their study of non linear ray tracing in media with varying index of refraction they demonstrated both a voxel based ray marching simulation and an analytic solution and created these images of mirages they rendered several animations of mirage effects moving up zooming in and shimmer more info grand central by pradyumna siddhartha and erick armbrust the honorable mention for best photon mapping implementation goes to pradyumna and erick for their rendering of grand central station they implemented photon mapping for participating media as well as caustics and surface interreflections more info simulating microfacet reflection by kurt akeley the honorable mention for experimental physics goes to kurt akeley for his experiments in simulating microfacet models more info fractals by daniel wong the honorable mention for most unique project goes to daniel for his ray tracing of 3d fractals he rendered an animation showing a fractal at varying numbers of iterations and another showing a revolving view of a julia set more info depth of field by david gupta the honorable mention for highest risk project goes to david's exploration of alternative sampling methods in a depth of field camera simulation more info other cool submissions in no particular order studio wineglass by jeff brasket and michael deleon jeff and mike used photon mapping and a reflection map to render the perfect wineglass more info packard by mike houston and jonathan ragan kelley mike and jonathan used photon mapping to reproduce the interior of the skylit packard building they used a realistic sky model and created a video showing the changing lighting over the course of a day more info soap bubbles by igor neverov igor simulated thin film interference and modeled the geometric properties of soap bubbles to create his pictures more info sea shells by keith ito and kai kam keith and kai modeled thin film interference for iridescent sea shells and added support for things like phong interpolation bump mapping thickness mapping and perlin noise check out their video more info flowers by ming tam for her project ming implemented hanrahan and krueger's subsurface scattering model and depth of field camera simulation more info sandstorm by yar woo yar modeled a sandstorm using volumetric techniques he created three videos showing light medium and heavy sandstorms more info martinis by khai weyn ong khai used photon mapping for both surface and volumetric global illumination as well as a depth of field camera more info abalone shells by shane witnov and rahul gupta shane and rahul implemented thin film interference and bump mapping to model abalone shells on a sandy beach they produced videos showing off their scene one showing a shell with a smooth surface and one bump mapped shell more info last modified
