figure 2 comparison of experimental sample associated dendrograms from two different hierarchical clustering analyses the top dendrogram is taken from figure 1 78 tumor samples with the status of tp53 indicated by the color of the terminal dendrogram line red lines indicate tumors with mutated tp53 genes green lines wildtype tp53 and black lines samples not tested the lower panel shows the experimental dendrogram from the hierarchical clustering analysis using only the 51 norway tumors and four normal breast tissues the subgroups are colored accordingly and show that the group of tumors highlighted in orange changed position compared to the dendrogram from figure 1 top panel furthermore the basal like tumors shown in red are inserted in between the luminal subtypes a and c to the left are shown the correlation coefficients for the dendrograms branches
