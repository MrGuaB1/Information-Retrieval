creating digital archives of 3d artworks creating digital archives of 3d artworks marc levoy hector garcia molina abstract recent improvements in laser rangefinder technology together with algorithms for combining multiple range and color images allow us to accurately digitize the external shape and surface characteristics of many physical objects this capability makes it possible for the first time to digitize and archive substantial bodies of three dimensional artistic and cultural artifacts such as statues buildings and archeological remains although the methodologies needed to create and manage digital archives of two dimensional artifacts have matured substantially in the last ten years the jump from two to three dimensions poses new problems these are problems of both scale and substance and they touch on every aspect of digital archiving storage indexing searching distribution viewing and piracy protection in this pilot project we are focusing on selected aspects of the following subproblems of this new domain cataloguing 3d artworks using techniques from image based rendering searching model based or image based catalogues and the internet for 3d models or rendered views of them protecting 3d archives against piracy using robust 3d digital watermarking efficient streaming of 3d models over networks of limited bandwidth real time display of large 3d models on low cost pcs as test data we are using a 250 gigabyte archive we are creating of the sculptures of michelangelo and the fragments of the forma urbis romae a giant marble map of ancient rome the data for this archive was generated during a year long digitization effort called the digital michelangelo project this project is supported by the national science foundation digital libraries initiative as of summer 2003 this pilot project has ended one concrete outcome of the project is scanview a secure client server rendering system that permits unlicensed users to examine 3d models but not extract the underlying data if you want to fly around our models of michelangelo's statues but you don t qualify for a license try this viewer the other goals of the pilot project have been folded into our digital forma urbis project recently funded by the nsf under the name solving the puzzle of the forma urbis romae people marc levoy hector garcia molina hector cs stanford edu szymon rusinkiewicz smr graphics stanford edu dave koller dk graphics stanford edu michael turitzin recent papers in this area protected interactive 3d graphics via remote rendering david koller michael turitzin marc levoy marco tarini giuseppe croccia paolo cignoni roberto scopigno proc siggraph 2004 a shortened version of this paper was the cover article in the june 2005 issue of communications of the acm cacm streaming qsplat a viewer for networked visualization of large dense models szymon rusinkiewicz marc levoy proc 2001 symposium on interactive 3d graphics qsplat a multiresolution point rendering system szymon rusinkiewicz marc levoy proc siggraph 2000 other links the white paper that motivated this project it describes in more detail the subproblems listed above web pages of the digital michelangelo project during which we acquired 3d scans of the statues of michelangelo web pages of the digital forma urbis romae project during which we acquired 3d scans of this marble map of ancient rome an archive of 3d models from the digital michelangelo project an archive of map fragments from the forma urbis romae project the scanalyze software package used to align and merge range data in the digital michelangelo project volfill our diffusion based hole filler for large polygon meshes the qsplat multi resolution viewer for large polygon models scanview a secure viewer that permits unlicensed users to examine 3d models but not extract the underlying data copyright 2000 marc levoy last update february 19 2006 09 41 29 pm
