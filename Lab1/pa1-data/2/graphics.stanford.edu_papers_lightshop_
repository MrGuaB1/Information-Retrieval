interactive light field editing and compositing lightshop interactive light field manipulation and rendering daniel horn stanford university billy chen microsoft to be presented at i3d 2007 abstract light fields can be used to represent an object's appearance with a high degree of realism however unlike their geometric counterparts these image based representations lack user control for manipulating them we present a system that allows a user to interactively manipulate composite and render multiple light fields lightshop is a modular system consisting of three parts 1 a set of functions that allow a user to model a scene containing multiple light fields 2 a ray shading language that describes how an image should be constructed from a set of light fields and 3 a real time light field rendering system in opengl that can plug into existing 3d engines as a glsl shader we show applications in digital photography and we demonstrate how to integrate light fields into a modern space flight game using lightshop paper adobe acrobat pdf 5.7 mb video uses windows media player 9 codec a video showing light field editing results using our system wmv 41 mb implementation details are in the paper
