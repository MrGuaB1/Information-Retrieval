light field microscopy at left is a light field captured by photographing a speck of fluorescent crayon wax through a microscope objective and microlens array the objective magnification is 16x and the field of view is 1.3 mm wide the image consists of 170x170 subimages one per microlens each depicting a different part of the specimen an individual subimage contains 20x20 pixels each representing a different point on the objective lens and hence a unique direction of view of the specimen by extracting one pixel from each subimage we can produce perspective views of the specimen a sequence of which is shown at top right alternatively by summing the pixels in each subimage we can produce orthographic views with a shallow depth of field like an ordinary microscope but of lower spatial resolution shearing the light field before summing we can focus at different depths as shown in the sequence at bottom right light field microscopy marc levoy ren ng andrew adams matthew footer mark horowitz stanford university acm transactions on graphics 25 3 proceedings of siggraph 2006 abstract by inserting a microlens array into the optical train of a conventional microscope one can capture light fields of biological specimens in a single photograph although diffraction places a limit on the product of spatial and angular resolution in these light fields we can nevertheless produce useful perspective views and focal stacks from them since microscopes are inherently orthographic devices perspective views represent a new way to look at microscopic specimens the ability to create focal stacks from a single photograph allows moving or light sensitive specimens to be recorded applying 3d deconvolution to these focal stacks we can produce a set of cross sections which can be visualized using volume rendering in this paper we demonstrate a prototype light field microscope lfm analyze its optical performance and show perspective views focal stacks and reconstructed volumes for a variety of biological specimens we also show that synthetic focusing followed by 3d deconvolution is equivalent to applying limited angle tomography directly to the 4d light field information available the paper pdf file 4 minute video mov file mpeg 4 22 mb the powerpoint slides from my presentation at siggraph 2006 our project web page which includes links to more results and movies lfdisplay a software package for real time viewing of microscope light fields the package includes sample light fields and step by step instructions on how to build a light field microscope lfm a web page describing other devices we have built to capture light fields note in the printed proceedings figure 1 came out poorly please refer instead to the version in the pdf file also reproduced above optical recipes for light field microscopes non infinity optics see memo for caption in our siggraph paper figure 2 gives the optical layout of our prototype light field microscope unfortunately this figure and its accompanying caption do not provide quite enough detail to set up and adjust a light field microscope this brief technical memo provides a more detailed optical layout with emphasis on how to vertically position and focus each element in the optical train we show this first for microscopes having non infinity corrected optics as in our siggraph paper we then describe an arrangement suitable for microscopes employing infinity corrected optics which is the more common case finally we address the often asked question of whether our microscope light fields contain aliasing yes they do infinity optics copyright 2006 by marc levoy last update june 6 2010 08 34 32 pm
