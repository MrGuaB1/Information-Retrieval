human cell cycle hela cells figures supplemental figure 15 supplemental figure 15 distribution of cell cycle regulated genes by phase the sine and cosine components from the fourier transform are plotted for each of the 1134 cell cycle regulated clones the location of genes that peak in each of the five different cell cycle phases from figure 2 is indicated the radial position of each gene represents the time of its peak expression during the cell cycle as determined by the fourier analysis only a small number of genes show peak expression during g1 phase of the cell cycle
