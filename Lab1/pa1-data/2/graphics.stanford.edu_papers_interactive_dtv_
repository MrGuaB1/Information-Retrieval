data placement for multi user interactive dtv data placement for multi user interactive dtv raju rangaswami edward chang chen li and milton chen appears in ieee international conference on multimedia and expo 2001 abstract in this paper we propose a novel digital vcr design which can enable non interactive broadcast dtv streams into interactive ones for supporting multiple playback devices simultaneously to enable viewing interactivity such as fast forward and instant replay for multiple users we show that it is critical to organize data effectively for improving io resolution reducing disk latency and minimizing storage cost we propose three data placement schemes that are built on a real time memory management module these schemes make different tradeoffs between io resolution disk latency and storage to maximize system throughput under different resource constraints paper adobe pdf format 280k miltchen graphics stanford edu
