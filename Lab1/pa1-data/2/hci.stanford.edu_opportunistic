opportunistic programming research stanford hci group courses people connect directions opportunistic programming helping people prototype ideate and discover by building software project abstract opportunistic programming is a method of software development that emphasizes speed and ease of development over code robustness and maintainability coding in this way allows individuals to explore many ideas quickly which has an important place in the overall sofware engineering process steps like prototyping ideation and discovery are often best accomplished by building a functional piece of software quickly and easily without the typical concerns of a broader scale software engineering project through fieldwork and a laboratory study we are focusing on five characteristics of opportunistic programming building software from scratch using high level tools adding new functionality through copy and paste atypically rapid iteration considering code to be impermanent and facing a unique set of debugging challenges using results from these two projects we plan on developing tools aimed at opportunistic programming that focus on debugging code foraging and reuse and documentation videos publications joel brandt mira dontcheva marcos weskamp scott r klemmer example centric programming integrating web search into the development environment chi acm conference on human factors in computing systems atlanta ga 2010 best paper nominee try it out video bjoern hartmann daniel macdougall joel brandt scott r klemmer what would other programmers do suggesting solutions to error messages chi acm conference on human factors in computing systems atlanta ga 2010 best paper nominee video joel brandt philip j guo joel lewenstein mira dontcheva scott r klemmer how the web helps people turn ideas into code book chapter in no code required giving users tools to transform the web edited by a cypher m dontcheva t lau j nichols morgan kaufmann 2010 joel brandt philip j guo joel lewenstein mira dontcheva scott r klemmer opportunistic programming writing code to prototype ideate and discover ieee software volume 26 issue 5 sept oct 2009 joel brandt philip j guo joel lewenstein mira dontcheva scott r klemmer two studies of opportunistic programming interleaving web foraging learning and writing code chi acm conference on human factors in computing systems boston ma 2009 best paper nominee joel brandt philip j guo joel lewenstein scott r klemmer opportunistic programming how rapid ideation and prototyping occur in practice fourth workshop on end user software engineering may 2008 william choi joel brandt scott r klemmer rehearse coding interactively while prototyping poster at uist 2008 acm symposium on user interface software and technology october 2008 video
