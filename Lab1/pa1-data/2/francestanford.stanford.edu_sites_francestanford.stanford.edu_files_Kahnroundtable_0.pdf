roundtable 4a bao panel albrecht moderator church brax kim schlegel burchat kahn s page 1 roundtable 4a bao panel albrecht moderator church brax kim schlegel burchat kahn scribe dine senatore 1 started with a quite general discussion about bao and other velocity space measurements each panel member stated his or her main questions and concerns about the techniques key issues raised were how clean are these measurements what are the underlying assumptions how sensitive are they to z dependence of w is there sensitivity to growth of structure what is the optimal redshift range for bao measurements how do instrumental or other considerations depend on redshift range what are the limiting systematics for boss bigboss euclid bao is there information in more than just the bao peaks what is the status of theoretical predictions of the shape of the peaks how advantageous is line of sight bao compared to transverse bao measured with imaging surveys how does bao complement other techniques are the foms that have been adopted disadvantageous to bao are there better metrics to use how to we weight the advantages of sampling in redshift space once you sample a volume with a bao tracer do you need to do it again with a different tracer 2 these are the general answers which emerged from the discussion bao by itself is indeed a relatively clean technique the biggest astrophysical issue has to do with nonlinear corrections to the shape of the peaks these have been evaluated with numerical n body simulations which are in remarkable agreement and which show minimal residual sensitivity to this systematic bao is a kinematic technique line of sight is important there is a factor 5 gain in sensitivity by using line of sight bao versus transverse bao page 2 however there is a lot of information in these velocity space surveys beyond bao redshift space distortions provide an important probe of growth of structure that complements cosmic shear and other measurements it is especially powerful to make velocity space and shear measurements of the same cosmic volume this then transitions from a statistical test of cosmological models to a point by point comparison of the velocity and matter fields low redshift bao surveys use absorption lines in the spectra these are robust and leads to high completeness 98 at higher z one is restricted to single line emission line surveys h alpha or o ii there is a potential for confusion there possibly the key instrumental issues involve simple sensitivity considerations eg aperture size spectrometer efficiency etc minimal resolving power for bao is 150 maximal resolving power necessary for velocity space surveys is a few hundred there is a lot of potential information about non gaussianity in velocity space measurements this is an exciting area of research
