modeling the behavior of thalamic neurons vclamp & cclamp modeling the behavior of thalamic neurons vclamp & cclamp david mccormick and i have written single cell modeling programs that can reproduce much of the cellular behavior of these neurons they are available for the taking references huguenard jr and mccormick da 1992 simulation of the currents involved in rhythmic oscillations in thalamic relay neurons j neurophysiol 68 1373 1383 mccormick da and huguenard jr 1992 a model of the electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay neurons j neurophysiol 68 1384 1400 description these programs will simulate the electrical behavior of neurons in either current clamp or voltage clamp modes the documentation is an ms word document with illustrations to get these be sure to set your web browser to receive to disk rather than the screen the files can also be obtained directly via anonymous ftp send me email for specific instructions to install the programs on your pc please obtain both install files install bat amp install txt and the programs themselves grow_prg exe the documentation is useful but not necessary to run the program download all files into a temporary directory then run install bat programs read me file installation file documentation file size 250 k programs 1 meg documentation the files are self extracting hardware software requirements ms dos computer ega or vga compatible display see the related page electrophysiology of the neuron modeling the behavior of thalamic neurons part ii dendritic excitability in thalamic reticular neurons a collaboration with a destexhe d contreras m steriade and t sejnowski demonstrated that the dendrites of gabaergic neurons of nucleus reticularis thalami nrt contain high levels of low threshold calcium channels these results suggest that low threshold bursts in nrt neurons are dendritically generated and that ongoing excitatory synaptic activity in the dendrites will strongly modulate burst generation look at alain destexhe's home page for a copy of the j neurosci paper more recently we confirmed that the dendritic localization of low threshold channels is also a prominent feature of thalamocortical relay cells
