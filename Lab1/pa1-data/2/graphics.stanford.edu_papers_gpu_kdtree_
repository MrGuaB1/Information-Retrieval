kd tree acceleration structures for a gpu raytracer kd tree acceleration structures for a gpu raytracer tim foley stanford university jeremy sugerman stanford university in proceedings of graphics hardware 2005 abstract modern graphics hardware architectures excel at compute intensive tasks such as ray triangle intersection making them attractive target platforms for raytracing to date all gpu based raytracers have relied upon uniform grid acceleration structures in contrast the kd tree has gained widespread use in cpu based raytracers and is regarded as the best general purpose acceleration structure we demonstrate two kd tree traversal algorithms suitable for gpu implementation and integrate them into a streaming raytracer we show that for scenes with many objects at different scales our kd tree algorithms are up to 8 times faster than a uniform grid in addition we identify load balancing and input data recirculation as two fundamental sources of inefficiency when raytracing on current graphics hardware figure 1 complex scenes rendered on a gpu with our method paper adobe acrobat pdf 535 kb presentation microsoft powerpoint 475 kb
