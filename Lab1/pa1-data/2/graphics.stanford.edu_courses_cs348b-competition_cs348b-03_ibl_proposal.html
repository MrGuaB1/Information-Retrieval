eric lee cs348 final project proposal cs348b final project proposal eric lee erl stanford edu may 22 2003 my final project will be to implement a set of tools for performing image based lighting the theory will be based on paul debevec's siggraph 1998 paper titled rendering synthetic objects into real scenes http www debevec org image based lighting techniques have become more important in recent years particularly for the film and television post production industry ibl provides a practical and more structured approach to produce convincing images of synthetic objects integrated with a photograph of a live scene there has been quite a lot of work done in this field jaemin lee has done some interesting work in image based lighting but unfortunately replicating his work would not be possible in the time given paul debevec's work is probably the most complete and thus i have chosen to start with his work my tasks can be roughly broken down as follows create a tool for combining multiple photographs taken at various exposure rates into a high definition image and viewing it create a tool for extracting lighting information from a high definition image of a mirrored ball and exporting it into lrt readable format make the necessary modifications to lrt for rendering a synthetic object with the extracted lighting information create a tool for compositing the rendered image with the original photograph having done some industry work in post production before coming to stanford my primary interest is in developing a system that supports a reasonable workflow for creating an image with image based lighting from data acqusition to the final image with such a system there are many kinds of images that i can try to reproduce however what would be much more interesting is creating enhanced images that are normally not possible or difficult to obtain in real life such as rendering a new statue into the middle of the stanford quad
