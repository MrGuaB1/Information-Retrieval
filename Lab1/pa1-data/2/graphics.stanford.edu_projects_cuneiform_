cuneiform tablet visualization project the stanford cuneiform tablet visualization project a photograph of a small cuneiform tablet the text unwrapped from the scanned 3d model and rendered with a combination of curvature and accessibility shading thousands of historically revealing cuneiform clay tablets which were inscribed in mesopotamia millenia ago still exist today visualizing cuneiform writing is important when deciphering what is written on the tablets it is also important when reproducing the tablets in papers and books unfortunately scholars have found photographs to be an inadequate visualization tool for two reasons first the text wraps around the sides of some tablets so a single viewpoint is insufficient second a raking light will illuminate some textual features but will leave others shadowed or invisible because they are either obscured by features on the tablet or are nearly aligned with the lighting direction we have investigated solutions to these problems we ve first created a high resolution 3d computer model from laser range data then unwrapped and flattened the inscriptions on the model to a plane allowing us to represent them as a scalar displacement map and finally we rendered this map non photorealistically using accessibility and curvature coloring the output of this semi automatic process enables all of a tablet's text to be perceived in a single concise image our technique can also be applied to other types of inscribed surfaces including bas reliefs people sean anderson seander cs stanford edu marc levoy recent paper in this area unwrapping and visualizing cuneiform tablets sean eron anderson and marc levoy ieee computer graphics and applications vol 22 no 6 november december 2002 pp 82 88 acknowledgements many thanks to ancient writing enthusiast renee kovacs for providing us with genuine cuneiform tablets to scan information on them and for suggesting the project if images on this page look dark to you see our note about gamma correction a list of technical papers with abstracts and pointers to additional information is also available or you can return to the research projects page or our home page copyright 2002 sean anderson and marc levoy last update february 19 2006 11 48 12 pm
