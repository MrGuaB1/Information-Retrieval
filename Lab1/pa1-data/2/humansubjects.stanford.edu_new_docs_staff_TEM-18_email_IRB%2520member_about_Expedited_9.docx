instructions for irb staff email template language re determining whether protocol qualifies for expedited 9 review dear irb member thank you for reviewing the above referenced protocol for the panel meeting it appears to staff that this study involves no greater than minimal risk to participants and no additional risks have been identified over the course of the research when the protocol was first reviewed it did not fit expedited categories 2 through 8 and thus had to be presented at a convened meeting at this review we would like to move the protocol to expedited 9 this means the protocol must be no greater than minimal risk and must have had no additional risks identified over the course of the research if you do not agree please notify me and we will assign you to present it at the next meeting otherwise your approval will allow us to designate this protocol as expedited it will continue to be reviewed for the life of the project but it will no longer need to be presented at a convened meeting as long as it continues to qualify for expedited 9 if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me signature block
