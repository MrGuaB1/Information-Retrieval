htsnp finder choosing snps using feature selection tu minh phuong zhen lin and russ b altman 2004 abstract a major challenge for genomewide disease association studies is the high cost of genotyping large num ber of single nucleotide polymorphisms snp the correlations between snps however make it possible to select a parsimonious set of informative snps known as tagging snps able to capture most variation in a popula tion considerable research interest has recently focused on the development of methods for finding such snps in this paper we present an efficient method for finding tagging snps the method does not involve computation intensive search for snp subsets but discards redundant snps using a feature selection algorithm in contrast to most existing methods the method presented here does not limit itself to using only correlations between snps in local groups by using correlations that occur across different chromosomal regions the method can reduce the number of globally re dundant snps experimental results show that the number of tagging snps selected by our method is smaller than by using block based approaches software the source code in c++ can be downloaded here home pca another tsnp finder please send questions to phuong phuongtu stanford edu
