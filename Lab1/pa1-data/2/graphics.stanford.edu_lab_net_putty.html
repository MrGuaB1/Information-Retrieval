graphics lab putty putty putty is a gui ssh client for windows please read the putty documentation for details and specific usage for the putty components this page assumes some basic familiarity using windows and some familiarity with ssh in general in particular for windows you should know how to modify your path and make shortcuts putty can do everything that the linux style ssh can do but it has its own syntax and clunkiness if you want real linux style ssh download the cygwin tools and go from there basic setup download the self installer and install putty be sure to include c program files putty in your path if you want command line access putty components most of the putty components map to a linux ssh equivalent if you don t know what the linux pieces do read their man pages putty and plink putty is a gui ssh client it is very similar to ttssh plink is a commandline ssh client one caveat be sure to throw the ssh commandline flag when using plink this tells plink to connect using ssh otherwise it won t work pscp the same as scp under linux puttygen similar to ssh keygen under linux generates an rsa public private key pair pageant similar to ssh agent under linux putty plink and pscp will consult with pageant if it is running to obtain any rsa keys to use during authentication rsa private key authentication if you are into rsa authentication for ssh here's a way to get it working under putty create rsa keys use use ssh keygen or puttygen to create an ssh2 rsa key if you use ssh keygen you have to import and save the private with puttygen because putty has its own storage format add the public key to ssh authorized_keys on all the systems you want to login to use pageant to copy key into memory start pageant and add the key s you want to use for authentication if you pass the key location to pageant as an argument it will start with that key automatically create a shortcut that does that in your startup folder if you want to save the hassle at each login now you can plink and pscp from the commandline without typing a password configure your putty sessions to use ssh2 and rsa keys under connection fill in auto login username under connection ssh select 2 only under connection ssh auth check allow agent forwarding under session select ssh default settings and save you can now create and save other profiles filling in the name of the system to connect to eg blit and then create desktop shortcuts appending load blit to the target command line last update april 9 2010 01 26 35 pm 1994 2012 stanford computer graphics laboratory
