leveraging the asymmetric sensitivity of eye contact for videoconferencing leveraging the asymmetric sensitivity of eye contact for videoconferencing milton chen appears in proceedings of chi 2002 abstract eye contact is a natural and often essential element in the language of visual communication unfortunately perceiving eye contact is difficult in most videoconferencing systems and hence limits their effectiveness we conducted experiments to determine how accurately people perceive eye contact we discovered that the sensitivity to eye contact is asymmetric in that we are an order of magnitude less sensitive to eye contact when people look below our eyes than when they look to the left right or above our eyes additional experiments support a theory that people are prone to perceive eye contact that is we will think that someone is making eye contact with us unless we are certain that the person is not looking into our eyes these experimental results suggest parameters for the design of videoconferencing systems as a demonstration we were able to construct from commodity components a simple dyadic videoconferencing prototype that supports eye contact paper adobe pdf format 496kb copyright notice from acm permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page copyrights for components of this work owned by others than acm must be honored abstracting with credit is permitted to copy otherwise to republish to post on servers or to redistribute to lists requires prior specific permission and or a fee miltchen graphics stanford edu
