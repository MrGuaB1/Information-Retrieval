shadow silhouette maps shadow silhouette maps pradeep sen mike cammarano pat hanrahan computer science department stanford university submitted to siggraph 03 abstract the most widely used techniques for interactive rendering of hard shadows are shadow maps and shadow volumes we observe that shadow map algorithms often suffice to determine shadowing for most areas of a rendered image however objectionable aliasing artifacts can arise in neighborhoods near the shadow silhouettes in contrast shadow volumes generate precise silhouettes but perform significant amounts of extra work even for pixels far from shadow edges in this paper we propose the method of silhouette maps in which a shadow depth map is augmented by storing the locations of representative points on the geometric silhouette a piece wise linear approximation to the true silhouette can then be found by applying dual contouring techniques the proposed method allows each silhouette map texel to represent a polygonal approximation to the actual shadowing geometry in contrast to the jagged approximation provided by a conventional shadow map we demonstrate an implementation of our approach running on programmable graphics hardware at interactive rates pdf 3.7 mb video 32mb avi pradeep sen this page created by mike cammarano mon 27 jan 2003 last modified mon 27 jan 2003
