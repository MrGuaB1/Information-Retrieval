vectastain protocol vectastain protocol 1 bring sections to rt let them dry for about 5 min 2 circle the edges of the slide with grease pen 3 prepare blocking buffer need 1 ml per slide add 1 drop 50l serum to 3.3 ml pbs 4 incubate sections for 20 30 min with 450 l blocking buffer keep remaining blocking buffer 5 prepare primary dilute primary antibody ie 1 100 in pbs 6 replace blocking with primary and incubate for 40 min 7 wash slides 2x 5 min in pbs 8 prepare biotinylated secondary dilute blue label biotinylated secondary 1 200 in remaining blocking buffer 9 incubate sections for 30 min with diluted secondary and immediately prepare abc reagent 10 add to 5 ml pbs 2 drops of reagent a mix and add 2 drops of reagent b and mix immediately and let stand for about 30 min before use 10 wash slides 2x 5 min in pbs 11 incubate sections for 30 min in abc reagent 12 wash slides 3x 3 min in pbs 13 prepare dab substrate gloves collect waste and discard seperately to 5.0 ml of distilled water add 2 drops of buffer stock solution mix add 4 drops of dab stock solution mix add 2 drops of hydrogen peroxide solution mix add 2 drops of nickel solution mix well 14 incubate the sections with dab substrate staining comes up during the first couple of minutes overstain a little bit not too much and stop the reaction in water 15 wash once again in water and embedd in 50 glycerol
