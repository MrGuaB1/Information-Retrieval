figure 1 hierarchical clustering of 115 tumor tissues and 7 non malignant tissues using the intrinsic gene set a a scaled down representation of the entire cluster of 540 genes and 122 tissue samples based on similarities in gene expression b experimental dendrogram showing the clustering of the tumors into five subgroups branches corresponding to tumors with low correlation to any subtype are shown in gray c gene cluster showing the erbb2 oncogene and other co expressed genes d gene cluster associated with luminal subtype be gene cluster associated with the basal subtype f a gene cluster relevant for the normal breast like group g cluster of genes including the estrogen receptor esr1 highly expressed in luminal subtype a tumors scale bar represents fold change for any given gene relative to the median level of expression across all samples see also figure 6 which is published as supporting information
