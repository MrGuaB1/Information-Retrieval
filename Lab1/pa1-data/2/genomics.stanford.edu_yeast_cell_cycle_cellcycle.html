cell_cycle_homepage welcome to the saccharomyces cell cycle expression database this site contains the complete characterization of mrna transcript levels during the cell cycle of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the purpose of this page is to provide access to genome wide expression levels in yeast and to communicate cell cycle dependent periodicity for 422 of the 6220 yeast open reading frames view cell cycle synchrony view movie additional figures full data in downloadable format adjacent cell cycle genes mammalian homologs of these genes functional categories of genes references this work was possible through a collaboration between stanford university dept of biochemistry michael j campbell elizabeth a winzeler andrew conway ronald w davis dept of genetics raymond j cho lars m steinmetz affymetrix david j lockhart lisa wodicka matthew ho ncbi tyra g wolfsberg andrei e gabrielian david landsman the name of the paper is genome wide analysis of cell cycle dependent transcription questions should be addressed to michael campbell at campbell cmgm stanford edu relevant links martinsreid institute for protein sequences saccharomyces genome database saccharomyces genome deletion project yale genome analysis center last revised march 3 1998 this site was constructed by lars steinmetz at larsms leland stanford edu larsms embl de michael campbell at campbell cmgm stanford edu michael campbell stanfordalumni org
