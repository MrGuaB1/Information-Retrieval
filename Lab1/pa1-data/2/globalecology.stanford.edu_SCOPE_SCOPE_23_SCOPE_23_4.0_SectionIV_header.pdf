remote sensing page 1 section iv remote sensing experience and prospects there is now a wealth of experience in use of remote sensing to measure and interpret various attributes of the vegetation of the earth the experience appropriate for research on the global carbon cycle embraces at once the most comprehensive and the most detailed and demanding approaches to use of satellite imagery aerial photography at much larger scales is the most probable basis for testing the utility and accuracy of any system based on satellite imagery the following papers were selected to provide a review of current uses of remote sensing in interpretation of attributes of vegetation the reviews focus on aircraft based imagery hoffer on satellite based imagery billingsley and on the difficulties inherent in proving on the ground that which may appear obvious in remotely sensed imagery park erickson describes in the final paper in this section the most comprehensive programme based on satellite imagery yet executed the large area crop inventory experiment page 2
