js dukes abstract comparison of the effect of elevated co 2 on an invasive species centaurea solstitialis in monoculture and community settings dukes js 2001 plant ecology 160 2 225 234 the ongoing increase in atmospheric co 2 concentration co 2 is likely to change the species composition of plant communities to investigate whether growth of a highly invasive plant species centaurea solstitialis yellow starthistle was affected by elevated co 2 and whether the success of this species would increase under co 2 enrichment i grew the species in serpentine soil microcosms both as a monoculture and as a component of a grassland community centaurea grown in monoculture responded strongly to co 2 enrichment of 350 imol mol 1 increasing aboveground biomass production by 70 inflorescence production by 74 and mid day photosynthesis by an average of 132 when grown in competition with common serpentine grassland species centaurea responded to co 2 enrichment with similar but nonsignificant increases 69 aboveground biomass 71 inflorescence production while total aboveground biomass of the polyculture increased by 28 centaurea's positive co2 response in monoculture and parallel but non significant response in polyculture provoke questions about possible consequences of increasing co 2 for more typical california grasslands where the invader already causes major problems
