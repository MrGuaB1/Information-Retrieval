a scalable multi user laser input system lumipoint multi user laser based interaction on large tiled displays james davis xing chen abstract projection technology has made large tiled displays an exciting feature of advanced visualization systems however one challenge to using such systems effectively is the development of input technologies that comfortably allow collaborative interaction with the displayed data on these large surfaces we have developed an input system that allows any number of users to interact simultaneously with data on a large display surface in this system each user utilizes a laser pointer as a pen or pointing device using computer vision techniques the system determines the beginning continuation and end of all currently active pointer strokes the coordinates of each stroke are available for use by visualization applications this system scales well with display size display resolution and number of users paper paper to appear displays 23.5 2002 pdf 447kb ps 2.5 mb older technical report version cs tr 2000 04 june 2000 pdf 857kb video realvideo 640x480 streaming realvideo 640x480 3.2 mb avi 320x240 8.9 mb slightly older version
