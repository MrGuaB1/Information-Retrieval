texture analysis and synthesis texture analysis and synthesis input sample synthesized result introduction texture is a ubiquitous visual experience it can describe a wide variety of surface characteristics such as terrain plants minerals fur and skin since reproducing the visual realism of the real world is a major goal for computer graphics textures are commonly employed when rendering synthetic images these textures can be obtained from a variety of sources such as hand drawn pictures or scanned photographs hand drawn pictures can be aesthetically pleasing but it is hard to make them photo realistic most scanned images however are of inadequate size and can lead to visible seams or repetition if they are directly used for texture mapping texture synthesis is an alternative way to create textures because synthetic textures can be made of any size visual repetition is avoided texture synthesis can also produce tileable images by properly handling the boundary conditions potential applications of texture synthesis are also broad some examples are image de noising occlusion fill in and compression the problem of texture synthesis can be stated as follows given a texture sample synthesize a new texture that when perceived by a human observer appears to be generated by the same underlying stochastic process an example is shown in the above figure our goal is to develope a new texture synthesis algorithm that is efficient general user friendly and able to produce high quality textures in addition we would like to extend the horizon of texture synthesis by exploring a variety of new applications based on our algorithm people li yi wei marc levoy papers texture synthesis from multiple sources by li yi wei in siggraph 2003 applications and sketches summary order independent texture synthesis by li yi wei and marc levoy rejected from siggraph 2003 paper order independent texture synthesis by li yi wei and marc levoy stanford university computer science department technical report tr 2002 01 paper texture synthesis by fixed neighborhood searching by li yi wei ph d dissertation thesis texture synthesis over arbitrary manifold surfaces by li yi wei and marc levoy in proceedings of siggraph 2001 paper talk images fast texture synthesis using tree structured vector quantization by li yi wei and marc levoy in proceedings of siggraph 2000 paper talk cool demos historical notes deterministic texture analysis and synthesis using tree structure vector quantization by li yi wei in proceedings of sibgraphi 1999 paper additional information texture synthesis examples note your browser need to be javascript powered in order to view most of the cool demos a list of frequently asked questions check this out before sending us your questions since they might already have been answered random text synthesis other texture research pages david heeger s pyramid based texture analysis synthesis jeremy de bonet s texture synthesis page eero simoncelli s texture synthesis page alyosha efros texture synthesis page michael ashikhmin s texture synthesis page dani lischinski's texture mixing and texture movie synthesis homepage microsoft research's chaos mosaic and patch based texture synthesis greg turk's texture synthesis on surfaces some online texture images comments comments or suggestions please send to liyiwei graphics stanford edu liyiwei graphics stanford edu
