antioscillatory effects of adenosine on thalamic network activity antioscillatory effects of adenosine on thalamic network activity daniel ulrich and i examined the effects of adenosine on presynaptic inhibition in the thalamus we find that adenosine acting at a1 receptors reduces both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic responses in thalamic relay and reticular cells this was surprising because previous work mainly in hippocampus from a number of laboratories suggested that the presynaptic effects of adenosine may be restricted to excitatory synaptic terminals we predicted that the previously described slow thalamic network activity huguenard and prince j neurosci 14 5485 5502 1994 would be dramatically down regulated by adenosine 50 um and this is indeed the case click on figure to see more detail
