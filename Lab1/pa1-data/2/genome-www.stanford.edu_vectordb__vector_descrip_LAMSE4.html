e coli phage vector lambda se4 incomplete lambda se4 vector ig sequence link general phage ds dna 46000 bp functions cloning selection copy number hosts e coli m5158 e coli suppliers atcc misc comments this vector uses spi selection for insertion of dna into the vector and has the ability to accept 2 19 kb sau3a1 bamhi bglii bcli or xhoii fragments 1 this vector was constructed by joining the 4.7 kb bamhi bglii fragment of pdpt427 low copy number replicon spectinomycin resistance to the left arm of lambda1059 1 with a bamhi digest the left arm is 24.1 kb the stuffer fragment encoding the spi+ phenotype is 16 kb and the right arm is 8.6 kb 2 this phagemid grows lytically as phage in non immune hosts or lysogenically as a phagemid in an immune host 1 plasmid is temperature inducible to produce infectious phage particles a phagemid vector useful for identification of genes by complementation medium is 1227 lb plus ampicillin 1 parents siblings descendents return to vector homepage
