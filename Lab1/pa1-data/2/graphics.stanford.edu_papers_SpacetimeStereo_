spacetime stereo spacetime stereo a unifying framework for depth from triangulation james davis diego nehab ravi ramamoothi szymon rusinkiewicz abstract depth from triangulation has traditionally been investigated in a number of independent threads of research with methods such as stereo laser scanning and coded structured light considered separately in this work we propose a common framework called spacetime stereo that unifies and generalizes many of these previous methods to show the practical utility of the framework we develop two new algorithms for depth estimation depth from unstructured illumination change and depth estimation in dynamic scenes based on our analysis we show that methods derived from the spacetime stereo framework can be used to recover depth in situations in which existing methods perform poorly documents conference paper james davis ravi ramamoothi szymon rusinkiewicz spacetime stereo a unifying framework for depth from triangulation ieee comp soc conf on computer vision and pattern recognition cvpr 2003 paper pdf poster pdf poster ppt tech report added analysis of moving objects james davis diego nehab ravi ramamoothi szymon rusinkiewicz spacetime stereo a unifying framework for depth from triangulation princeton comp sci tech report tr 689 04 2004 pdf journal paper shortened and clarified the tech report james davis diego nehab ravi ramamoothi szymon rusinkiewicz spacetime stereo a unifying framework for depth from triangulation ieee trans on pattern analysis and machine intelligence pami vol 27 no 2 feb 2005 pdf examples depth from unstructured lighting on static scenes when the scene to be recovered is static and contains unstructured illumination change temporal stereo produces significantly better depth estimates than does traditional spatial stereo temporal stereo works well even under challenging conditions such as a white object in front of a white wall illuminated only by a hand held flashlight results are intensity coded depth images avi divx 2.4 mb traditional spatial stereo temporal stereo accurate results are possible when the temporal variation in the lighting provides sufficient information for good correspondence using a slowly moving light stripe and temporal processing we obtain 0.044 mm rms error 0.13 mm peak noise on a test target dynamic scenes using higher frequency lighting variation allows the shape of dynamic objects to be recovered as well we create the necessary lighting with a projector that is neither synchronized nor calibrated with respect to the cameras note that subtle details such as the bulging of a cheek during a smile can be clearly seen in the resulting videos of rendered geometry avi divx 1.3 mb avi front avi 3 4 avi side mp4 3 4 mobile robotics we have started to investigate using this technology for mobile robotic map building below we see the robot itself with mounted spacetime stereo range capture equipment the robot in action and rendered polygon meshes of the captured geometry from both the front and top view avi divx 1.5 mb avi divx 6.7 mb avi 2.0 mb related work researchers at the university of washington simultaneously published nearly identical ideas we initially focused our work more on describing a framework for categorizing and understanding a broad set of related triangulation techniques while they initially focused more on recovering the shape of dynamic scenes you may find their paper and results interesting as well l zhang b curless sm seitz spacetime stereo shape recovery for dynamic scenes ieee comp soc conf on computer vision and pattern recognition cvpr 2003 project web page
