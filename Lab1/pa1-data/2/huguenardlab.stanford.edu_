the huguenard lab the huguenard lab studies of thalamocortical synchrony and epilepsy john r huguenard ph d we are interested in the neuronal mechanisms that underlie synchronous oscillatory activity in the thalamus cortex and the massively interconnected thalamocortical system such oscillations are related to cognitive processes normal sleep activities and certain forms of epilepsy our approach is an analysis of the discrete components that make up thalamic and cortical circuits and reconstitution of components into both in vitro biological and in silico computational networks accordingly we have been able to identify genes whose products mainly ion channels play key roles in the regulation of thalamocortical network responses currently projects focus on development of excitatory connections in neocortex with an emphasis on ampa receptor alterations in the early postnatal period molecular pharmacology of inhibitory gaba a receptors in the thalamus and the role of receptor binding unbinding and desensitization in regulating inhibitory function analysis of progression and destabilization of widespread thalamic network activity using large microelectrode arrays the roles of neuropeptides especially npy sst and vip in regulating thalamic and cortical function reorganization of neocortical connectivity following injury roles of specific gaba b receptors in regulating pre and postsynaptic function the laboratory uses experimental techniques ranging from biophysical studies of single ion channels to in vivo recording to purely theoretical studies of network synchrony our toolbox includes use of mutant mouse models for analysis of gene function in circuit behavior for example knockout and knockin mice have been used to identify the specific gaba a receptor isoforms that are critical for the therapeutic actions of benzodiazepines in thalamus patch clamp recording methods for single channels and whole cell currents with both isolated neurons and those in situ in brain slices multi unit multi site extracellular recording techniques immunohistochemical techniques for cell identification and protein localization molecular & genetic approaches for in situ hybridization of specific transcripts microscopic techniques for computerized neuronal reconstruction neurolucida laser uncaging of photo labile glutamate derivatives for circuit analysis imaging of network activity via fret glutamate nanosensors single cell intracellular perfusion for modification of eg phosphorylation state paired intracellular recordings for analysis of single axon synaptic connection fluorometric detection of calcium indicator dyes in cells and circuits local perfusion within slice micro regions for pharmacological analysis computer based modeling of single cell and circuit behaviors awards and news people publications misc lab photos some completed projects methods programs synaptic current detector etc lab documents and photo albums metatape analysis program epilepsy training program lab meeting the neurology neuroscience softball team myoclonic jerks links visitor number comments or questions john huguenard stanford edu department of neurology and neurological sciences room m030 alway building stanford university school of medicine stanford ca 94305 5122 phone 650 723 5522 fax 650 723 1080
