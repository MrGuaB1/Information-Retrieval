guibas lab the geometric computing group is part of the computer science department at stanford university and is currently based in the clark center for bioengineering the geometric computation group headed by professor leonidas guibas addresses a variety of algorithmic problems in modeling physical objects and phenomena and in computation communication and sensing as applied to the physical world current foci of interest include geometric modeling with point cloud data deformations and contacts sensor networks for lightweight distributed estimation reasoning and modeling the shape and motion biological macromolecules and other biological structures more theoretical work is aimed at investigating fundamental computational issues and limits in geometric computing and modeling faculty leonidas guibas post docs mirela ben chen adrian butscher jonathan huang qixing huang evangelos kalogerakis graduate students daniel chen ian downes xing fu chen gu kyle heath nan hu xiaoye jiang young min kim andy nguyen justin solomon fan wang zixuan wang recent alumni bart adams emilio antunez qing fang jie gao natasha gelfand omprakash gnawali rachel kolodny brano kusy hyungjune lee nikola milosavljevic niloy mitra dmitriy morozov arik motskin an nguyen steve oudot maks ovsjanikov mark pauly manjunath rajashekhar daniel russel jaewon shin primoz skraba jian sun michael wand martin wicke danny yang afra zomorodian copyright 2007 guibas laboratory all rights reserved
