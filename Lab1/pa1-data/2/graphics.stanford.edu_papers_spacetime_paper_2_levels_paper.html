better optical triangulation through spacetime analysis next next 1 introduction better optical triangulation through spacetime analysis brian curless and marc levoy stanford university abstract the standard methods for extracting range data from optical triangulation scanners are accurate only for planar objects of uniform reflectance illuminated by an incoherent source using these methods curved surfaces discontinuous surfaces and surfaces of varying reflectance cause systematic distortions of the range data coherent light sources such as lasers introduce speckle artifacts that further degrade the data we present a new ranging method based on analyzing the time evolution of the structured light reflections using our spacetime analysis we can correct for each of these artifacts thereby attaining significantly higher accuracy using existing technology we present results that demonstrate the validity of our method using a commercial laser stripe triangulation scanner 1 introduction 2 error in triangulation systems 3 a new method spacetime analysis 4 implementation 5 results 6 conclusion references about this document curless graphics stanford edu
