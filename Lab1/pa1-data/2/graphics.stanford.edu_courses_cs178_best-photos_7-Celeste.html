assignment 7 night and color assignment 7 night and color celeste celeste noche washington avenue when i took this photo i wanted a large depth of field to keep all of the house's details in focus so i used f 9 normally this would mean that i d need more light elsewhere but since it was a very clear day i was able to take the photo with at iso 100 and shutter speed 1 100 in the original photos a lot of the photo is green because it's a green house with a lawn and the surrounding flora to highlight the smallness of the house i decided to make the green stand out against a black and white background to do this i first saturated the colors in photoshop then created a black and white layer i then used a layer mask to delete the black and white where the green was visible in the original photo initially i only colored the house but i thought it looked a little lonely so i decided to use the green in the two trees on either side of the house to balance out the photos a little more in the bush at the bottom right of the house there were pink flowers but i didn t want them to distract from the green so i left the flower buds in greyscale previous back to all photos next
