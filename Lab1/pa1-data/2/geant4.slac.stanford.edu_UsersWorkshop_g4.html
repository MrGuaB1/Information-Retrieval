geant4 home geant4 poster click to enlarge geant4 is a general purpose simulation toolkit for elementary particles interacting with matter its usage ranges from high energy cosmic or accelerated particle physics nuclear physics the assessment of radiation shielding and satellites and is expanding into medical physics studies geant4 provides a comprehensive set of tools for all domains of simulation in these fields geometry tracking detector response run event and track management visualization and user interface an abundant set of physics models handles the diverse interactions of particles with matter across a wide energy range reflecting geant4's multi disciplinary character a choice of models is available for many physics processes the first public version of geant4 was released in 1998 since then the production services user supports and further developments are continuously provided by a world wide collaboration of more than 100 scientists participating in more than 10 large high energy physics experiments space science missions and medical science studies geant4 exploits advanced software engineering technologies and object oriented methodologies to achieve transparency of the physics implementation and enhance the level of validation of the physics results the geant4 object oriented design allows the user to understand customize or extend the toolkit in all the domains geant4 related links geant4 home geant4 user's documents download geant4 geant4 results reports and publications geant4 hypernews forum slac geant4 team workshop local organizer
