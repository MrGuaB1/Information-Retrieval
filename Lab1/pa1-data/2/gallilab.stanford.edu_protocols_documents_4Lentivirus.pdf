transient transfection of 293t cells for the production of lentiviral vectors page 1 transient transfection of 293t cells for lentiviral production from laurie ailles weissman lab this is the protocol the galli lab uses 1 seed and incubate 3 x 10 6 293t cells per 10 cm dish approximately 24 hours prior to transfection in imdm with 10 fbs 2 2 hours prior to transfection change media 3 prepare plasmid dna in 50 ml conical tubes as follows per 10 cm dish 10 ug transfer vector plasmid 6.5 ug cmv r8 74 plasmid 3.5 ug vsv g plasmid bring up to a total volume of 450 ul with diluted te if you are transfecting more than one dish you can mix the appropriate amount of dna and te in a single tube then aliquot it into individual tubes prior to adding the cacl2 add 50 ul 2.5 m cacl2 add 500 ul 2x hbs dropwise while vortexing at full speed about 2 drops per second immediately add total volume to plate of 293t cells and swirl plate to disperse precipitate incubate plates at 37oc 4 change media approximately 16 hours later 5 collect the media 24 hours later filter through 0.45 um filter and store at 4oc add fresh media to plates 6 collect media again after another 24 hours filter 7 pool media together and ultracentrifuge in sw28 rotor 19500 rpm 2hours 20 min 8 pour off supernatant resuspend pellet in a small volume of pbs with 0.1 bsa agitate on a rocker or rotator at room temp for at least 30 min to completely solubilize vector do a quick spin to spin out insoluble junk aliquot and store at 80oc diluted te dilute 1x te 1 15 in sterile water 1x te 0.5 ml 1m tris hcl ph 7.5 0.25 ml 200 mm edta in 50 ml total filter through 0.22 um filter 2.5 m cacl2 18.38 g in 50 ml water filter through 0.22 um filter aliquot and freeze at 20oc page 2 2x hbs 8.0 g nacl note store 0.37 g kcl at 20oc 0.19 g na2hpo4 7h20 do not store 1.0 g dextrose in fridge for 5.0 g hepes more than 2 wks adjust ph to 7.2 bring volume up to 500 ml filter through 0.22 um filter aliquot and freeze at 20oc
