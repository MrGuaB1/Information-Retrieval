3d transformations 3d transformations cs 248 introduction to computer graphics autumn quarter 2004 marc levoy lecture notes for tuesday october 26 table of contents modeling hierarchies homogeneous representation of 3d transformations inverses of 2d and 3d transformations opengl calls transforming points lines planes taxonomy of mappings concatenating a matrix let's say f with the matrix at the top of the stack let's say h denoted h circle f above and said h composed with f means perform the matrix multiplication h times f in that order we sometimes describe this multiplication by saying that f is right concatenated onto h remember that matrix multiplication is not commutative so the order does matter thus the 3d cartesian coordinates occupy the w 1 three dimensional subspace within 4d homogeneous space n 3 in the above taxonomy in other words linear mappings in 2d are those that can be accomplished using a 2 x 2 matrix multiplication with the coordinates not raised to any power as inputs for this reason the w 1 plane is sometimes called the 2d affine space associated with the 3d homogeneous coordinate space note also that this perspective foreshortening required a division by w to accomplish the columns of this chart are assumed to be in the same space in particular if we are talking about rigid affine and projective transformations in r n 1 with respect to the taxonomy then the linear column also refers to linear transformations in r n 1 not in r n levoy cs stanford edu copyright 2004 marc levoy last update october 26 2004 04 55 23 pm
