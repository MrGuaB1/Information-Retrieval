a design and implementation for effective computer generated route maps a design and implementation for effective computer generated route maps maneesh agrawala and chris stolte computer science department stanford university aaai symposium on smart graphics march 2000 abstract a route map depicting a path from one location to another is a powerful tool for visualizing and communicating directions however it can be difficult for a computer to automatically render route maps that meet the four design goals of effective route maps readability clarity completeness and convenience achieving all of these goals requires trade offs we survey the cartography graphic design and psychology literature for insight about these trade offs we then analyze several common route mapping styles to demonstrate the variables in map design what information is included the precision of that information and the rendering style this analysis illustrates that hand drawn route maps are particularly effective finally we describe in detail a design and implementation for computer generated maps that mimics the style of hand drawn route maps postscript 3.9 mb compressed 7.8 mb uncompressed or pdf 1.6 mb maneesh agrawala last modified thu apr 6 12 48 24 pdt 2000
