haptic audio visual network for education and training havnet evaluation end to end performance impact on learning impact on enterprise impact on technology end to end performance we conducted a study of student perception of rsv images under degraded image quality the degradations included reduction of the available bandwidth for the transport of the images through the network links and two different latencies between server and client subjects 1st year stanford medical students and their anatomy tas variables resolution hand images at multiple resolutions original resolution 978x1357 50 resolution 489x679 and 25 resolution 245x339 in addition we used adobe photoshop compression quality to vary the images latency images from local or remote servers stanford and michigan bandwidth images sets that were bandwidth restricted 1 mbps 2 mbps 5 mbps 10 mbps 15 mbps 20 mbps 30 mbps 40 mbps 50 mbps 60 mbps 70 mbps content hand images with an interactive quizzing script methodology tested all the variations and prepared 20 variations for pilot test selected 10 scenarios variations for the users to rate prepared video samples of each end of the continuum trained tas to use and teach others to use remote stereo viewer prepared a quiz that required subjects to use application thoroughly and interactively prepared 2 sets of images that were used in a teaching and learning context pilot test once we had the 20 variations we had 8 users from summit rate the images on image quality and responsiveness rating corresponds to which means that the degradation 5 excellent is not noticeable 4 good is noticeable but not annoying 3 fair is annoying 2 poor makes the application very hard to use 1 bad makes the application unusable based on their responses we then selected 10 image sets for the subjects implementation 5 students plus a ta met in the summit collab room where we set up 6 individual stations plus a theater style seating in front of the stereo projection screen after an initial orientation about the study and the havnet grant project we asked the students to rate ten image sets on a scale of one to five as shown in the above figure they were asked to rate based on the image quality sharpness ability to differentiate detail outline of anatomy vs background clarity of 3d and responsiveness length of response time between user and computer one of the researchers then showed each of the images explaining when he started rotating the image and when he stopped the rotation was repeated then the subjects were asked to rate the image this process was repeated for all 10 image sets stanford 1 mbps full resolution best quality stanford 1 mbps 25 resolution poor quality stanford 20 mbps full resolution best quality stanford 70 mbps full resolution best quality michigan 1 mbps 25 resolution poor quality michigan 1 mbps 50 resolution poor quality michigan 2 mbps full resolution best quality michigan 5 mbps 50 resolution poor quality michigan 30 mbps full resolution best quality michigan 30 mbps 25 resolution poor quality the final component of the study provided us with the opportunity to understand how students would rate the images in a teaching and learning context the ta quizzed the students asking them to identify various features of the hand the leadership rotated between the ta and the students giving them a way to rate the responsivness of the application in addition by trying to identify various anatomical features they were able to rate the quality of the images results the analysis of the data provides some important insights into the understanding of the impact on user perception an important finding from the analysis is that medical students rated with scores around 4 considered very good the scenario where the rsv application works with a network connection set at 5mbps and with an image set at 50 resolution this is a striking finding considering that the non degraded scenario works with a bandwidth around the high 70 mbps and 100 image resolution this opens the opportunity to extend the use of rsv on ieee 802.11 wireless lan environments where bandwidth is scarce we also investigated the impact of responsiveness and image quality on the overall user perception we found that the responsiveness component has a bigger influence on the overall perceived quality of the rsv application site map feedback terms usage 2007 stanford university all rights reserved
