clawhmmer clawhmmer a streaming hmmer search implementation daniel reiter horn stanford university mike houston stanford university pat hanrahan stanford university supercomputing 2005 abstract the proliferation of biological sequence data has motivated the need for an extremely fast probabilistic sequence search one method for performing this search involves evaluating the viterbi probability of a hidden markov model hmm of a desired sequence family for each sequence in a protein database however one of the difficulties with current implementations is the time required to search large databases many current and upcoming architectures offering large amounts of compute power are designed with data parallel execution and streaming in mind we present a streaming algorithm for evaluating an hmm's viterbi probability and refine it for the specific hmm used in biological sequence search we implement our streaming algorithm in the brook language allowing us to execute the algorithm on graphics processors we demonstrate that this streaming algorithm on graphics processors can outperform available cpu implementations we also demonstrate this implementation running on a 16 node graphics cluster paper adobe acrobat pdf 216 kb sourcecode binaries sourceforge project
