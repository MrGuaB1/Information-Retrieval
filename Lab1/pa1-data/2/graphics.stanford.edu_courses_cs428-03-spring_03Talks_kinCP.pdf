the closest pair problem page 1 the closest pair problem suppose that we want to maintain the closest pair among n mov ing points in the plane our kinetic closest pair  cp algorithm is based on a new static cp algorithm we maintain for each point directional nearest neighbors in each of three cones the cp must be one of the 3n pairs thus defined ljg 15 page 2 sweeping to obtain directional neighbors the horizontal sweep computes three data structures for each point p cands p parentsu p and parents d p p cands p lcand p parentsu p each of the three sweeps can be done in o nlogn time and will detect all directional neighbors in its direction ljg 16 page 3 kinetizing the cp algorithm for  cp each of cands p parentsu p and parents d p is maintained as a balanced tree supporting efficient merges and splits the only relevant events are changes in the order of the points along the 0 60 and 120 directions q p q p ljg 17 page 4 completing the cp maintenance there are o n 2 order exchange events to process each of which can be processed in polylog time to determine the cp we neeed to also maintain a  t on the distances of all the points to their directional neighbors this tournament must handle flight plan updates or discrete changes whenever these directional neighbors change it can be shown that that the cost of processing the tournament events is also roughly quadratic thus  cp is efficient responsive local and compact ljg 18
