funding creative avenues for exploration thestanfordchallenge stanford edu page 1 winter 2010 funding creative avenues for exploration by kristen munson karen clark parent 13 was surprised when her daughter xandra an aspiring performer announced she wanted to study drama at stanford my primary interaction with the university had been with earthquake engineers explains clark an expert in catastrophe risk management given its reputation for science and technology i wondered how stanford had gotten to the top of her college list during admit weekend clark was pleased to learn that stanford was home to artists as well as scientists in fact she and her daughter found the arts were thriving on campus we were sold clark says four years ago the university launched a comprehensive arts initiative to enhance core arts departments and integrate the arts into the everyday student experience the newly established stanford institute for creativity and the arts acts as the initiative's nerve center leading the development of new arts programs and facilities awarding grants for multidisciplinary arts research and teaching and expanding opportunities for students to experience the arts on and off campus the effort is taking root firmly last year one in four undergraduate students was involved in an art group at stanford clark and her husband pankaj tandon wanted to support this mission recently they made a gift to help bring visiting artists to campus as well as support student performances and research in the arts working alongside internationally recognized directors dancers and critics enables students to gain exposure to creative practices and networks beyond stanford for instance last winter the drama department hosted acclaimed director karin coonrod of the public theater of new york to direct a series of sketches from shakespeare's love's labor's lost students designed and constructed their costumes and even wrote original music for the productions drama major jay marie hill 10 worked alongside a professional director for the first time stage managing can be stressful you and the director need to be on the same page hill says working with a professional for the first time was definitely hard at times but i think that's the point i definitely learned a lot from karin and i think she learned a lot from me while opportunities like this are resume building for students who arrive at stanford already interested in careers in the arts clark and tandon hope their gift will also benefit students who grew up where the arts were not a focus or where schools were forced to trim arts programs from their budgets we have always believed that college should be a time of experimentation and exploration says clark the arts in particular provide unique opportunities for different cultural aesthetic and emotional experiences they provide important avenues for understanding others the world around us and ourselves hill couldn t agree more she had limited exposure to the arts before attending stanford stumbled into drama after helping friends with set design and lighting and found a supportive environment through which she could explore and grow you wouldn t look at me and think i do drama hill says and that's really what stanford is all about diversity of character drama is applicable to every field of study and every walk of life thestanfordchallenge stanford edu 2010 stanford university all rights reserved stanford benefactor is a publication of the office of development contact stanfordbenefactor stanford edu the clark tandon family photo courtesy of k clark
