compiling to a vliw fragment pipeline compiling to a vliw fragment pipeline william r mark kekoa proudfoot proceedings of siggraph eurographics workshop on graphics hardware 2001 abstract the latest generation of graphics hardware supports fully programmable vertex and pixel fragment operations but programming this hardware at a low level is difficult and time consuming to address this problem we have developed a complete real time procedural shading system that compiles a high level shading language to programmable vertex and fragment hardware as described in a separate publication in this paper we describe in detail the algorithms used by this system to generate and optimize fragment code for nvidia's register combiner architecture and show that our compiler generates efficient code the register combiner architecture has some similarities to vliw cpu architectures so we compare our compilation algorithms to those described in the literature for vliw cpu architectures we also discuss some of the lessons we learned from building and using this compiler that may be useful to the designers of future programmable graphics hardware paper adobe pdf format 115 k talk slides html
