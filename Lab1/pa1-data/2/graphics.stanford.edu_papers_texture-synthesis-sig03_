order independent texture synthesis order independent texture synthesis li yi wei and marc levoy submitted to siggraph 2003 jan 2003 basic idea of our algorithm in this example we use an output pyramid with 4 levels and 3 generations and a neighborhood template of size 5x5 l_3 g_2 the upper left image contains an user requested pattern s l_0 g_0 the lower right image is initialized by randomly copying from the input in the squares representing the remaining levels and generations only a portion of the texels denoted in pink above must be computed abstract search based texture synthesis algorithms are sensitive to the order in which texture samples are generated different synthesis orders yield different textures unfortunately most polygon rasterizers and ray tracers do not guarantee the order with which surfaces are sampled to circumvent this problem textures are synthesized beforehand at some maximum resolution and rendered using texture mapping we describe a search based texture synthesis algorithm in which samples can be generated in arbitrary order yet the resulting texture remains identical the key to our algorithm is a pyramidal representation in which each texture sample depends only on a fixed number of neighboring samples at each level of the pyramid the bottom coarsest level of the pyramid consists of a noise image which is small and predetermined when a sample is requested by the renderer all samples on which it depends are generated at once using this approach samples can be generated in any order to make the algorithm efficient we propose storing texture samples and their dependents in a pyramidal cache although the first few samples are expensive to generate there is substantial reuse so subsequent samples cost less fortunately most rendering algorithms exhibit good coherence so cache reuse is high available information paper in pdf format 3.9 mb video in mpeg format 32.3 mb short talk in power point format 1.3 mb liyiwei graphics stanford edu
