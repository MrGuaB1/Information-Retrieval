powerpoint presentation streaming qsplat a viewer for networked visualization of large dense models szymon rusinkiewicz marc levoy stanford university motivation 1 range scanning makes it possible to create 3d models of interesting complex objects fast networking is becoming common even at home how to stream high resolution 3d models across the net motivation 2 under what conditions has streaming been studied low speed eg modem topological surgery metacreations realitywave maximum compression at any cost high speed eg local disk architectural walkthrough terrain flythrough hide presence of streaming medium speed eg dsl managing user interaction streaming qsplat based on qsplat a multiresolution point rendering system low cost no special preprocessing for streaming no server support use standard web server low cpu and graphics requirements for client flexible enough to allow exploration of user interface issues streaming qsplat review of qsplat data structure and rendering algorithm modifying algorithm for network streaming user interface color coding download order magnifying glass review of qsplat an interactive viewer for large models 10 8 10 9 samples fast startup and progressive loading maintains interactive frame rate compact data structure fast preprocessing qsplat data structure key observation a single bounding sphere hierarchy can be used for hierarchical frustum and backface culling level of detail control splat rendering qsplat node structure position and radius tree structure normal width of cone of normals color optional 13 bits 3 bits 14 bits 2 bits 16 bits 6 bytes qsplat rendering algorithm traverse hierarchy recursively if node not visible skip this branch else if leaf node draw a splat else if size on screen threshold draw a splat else traverse children hierarchical frustum backface culling point rendering adjusted to maintain desired frame rate level of detail control addition of network streaming if node not visible skip this branch else if leaf node draw a splat else if size on screen threshold draw a splat else if any child not present draw a splat place children on request queue else traverse children addition of network streaming new data structures availability mask which nodes or groups of nodes are present on the client request queue for parts of the model new thread make requests for regions of the file listen for responses update availability mask availability mask what granularity small granularity permits requests for precisely the visible regions large granularity necessary for memory efficiency and to avoid overhead of many tiny requests current implementation uses 1k blocks request queue prioritized queue priorities determine download order cleared on every frame view dependent streaming color coding color coding for visualization of relative resolution present in different areas demo st matthew 3d scan of 2.7 meter statue at 0.25 mm 102868637 points file size 644 mb preprocessing time 1 hour network bandwidth limited to 384 kbps choice of streaming order choices for streaming order level within hierarchy size of node in world coordinates projected screen space size projected y coordinate combination of 4 and 5 coarse ordering based on quantized log splat size fine ordering based on projected y coordinate magnifying glass provide tools for flexible control over download order example magnifying glass conclusions streaming qsplat permits interactive display of large complex models across a network given today's network speeds need more research on user interaction techniques for streaming 3d data
