microbial synthesis of biodiesel 1 year progress report chaitan khosla khosla stanford edu page 1 1 microbial synthesis of biodiesel 1 st year progress report chaitan khosla khosla stanford edu the overall goal of our efforts is to develop a microbial process for biodiesel synthesis e coli has been selected as a target bacterium for this project our specific aims are as follows 1 overproduce fatty acids in escherichia coli we are harnessing both genetic and fermentation strategies to do so genetic strategies include manipulation of fatty acid metabolism fermentation strategies include developing analytical methods to measure carbon flux into the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway under fed batch fermentation conditions these methods will facilitate optimization of fermentation conditions for biodiesel production 2 produce biodiesel in escherichia coli we are evaluating the ability of a variety of microbial enzymes to directly produce fatty acid methyl esters in e coli 3 produce fatty aldehydes alcohols and esters in escherichia coli as precursors to novel biofuels we are introducing new enzymatic systems into e coli that synthesize aldehyde alcohol and ester derivatives of fatty acids for potential use as new biodiesel components
