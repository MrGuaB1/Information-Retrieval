pde computational simulations page 1 pde computational simulations principal investigator dr ronald k hanson research associates dr jay jeffries dr david davidson research assistant zach owens overview we have developed two primary numerical simulations to aid in the setup and interpretation of the data from our optical diagnostic experiments the first code is a fully implicit 2 d navier stokes solver this code is useful in our assessment of viscous and heat transfer effects on the pde some results from this code are presented in figures 1 and 2 the second code is a fully explicit quasi 1d euler solver both this code and the 2 d code use a flux difference splitting algorithm on the convective fluxes the quasi 1d code produces results in very close agreement with the 2 d code under typical run conditions and at a fraction of the computational expense accordingly this solver is used extensively especially for quick parametric studies both simulations employ frozen chemistry and a characteristics based outflow boundary condition figure 1 simulated head end pressure for both straight tube and converging nozzle pde configurations page 2 figure 2 simulated burned gas velocity at location at 90 tube length station for straight tube and converging nozzle pde configurations figure 3 simulated pressure in pde with converging diverging nozzle
