the stanford cityblock project the panorama above at right is a portion of the north side of castro street in mountain view ca this panorama was constructed by aligning and pasting together narrow vertical strips extracted from consecutive frames of a video sequence the sequence was captured by a sideways looking high speed video camera mounted in the back of a slowly moving car shown at left manned by phd student gaurav garg to reduce distortion in the trees and alleyway a mosaic of cross slit projections and ordinary perspective views is employed the lines of sight for this mosaic are shown in plan view beneath the panorama the stanford cityblock project multi perspective panoramas of city blocks visualization of cities and urban landscapes has been a recurrent theme in western art the key problem in making these visualizations successful is summarizing in a single image the extended linear architectural fabric seen at eye level along a possibly curving or turning street and doing so without introducing excessive distortions at the stanford computer graphics laboratory we have been building technology for digitizing commercial city blocks from sideways looking video taken from a vehicle driving down the street the input to our system is a set of video frames with known camera pose the output is a single multi perspective image that summarizes one or more city blocks in our work we have explored the use of pushbroom panoramas cross slit panoramas and mosaics of these non perspective projections interleaved with ordinary perspective views possible applications include in car navigation online route visualization and web based tourism broader applications of multi perspective panoramas from video captured by moving vehicles include remote sensing and mapping underwater photography and archaeological documentation this project is funded by google current status this project ended in june 2006 and its technology has been folded into google's streetview two of the students augusto and vaibhav are currently at google working on that project people gaurav garg ggaurav graphics stanford edu hendrik pa lensch lensch stanford edu marc levoy augusto roman aroman stanford edu vaibhav vaish vaibhav graphics stanford edu recent papers in this area automatic multiperspective images augusto roman hendrik pa lensch proc 2006 eurographics symposium on rendering interactive design of multi perspective images for visualizing urban landscapes augusto roman gaurav garg marc levoy proc visualization 2004 if images on this page look dark to you see our note about gamma correction a list of technical papers with abstracts and pointers to additional information is also available or you can return to the research projects page or our home page copyright 2004 marc levoy last update october 15 2009 08 09 12 pm
