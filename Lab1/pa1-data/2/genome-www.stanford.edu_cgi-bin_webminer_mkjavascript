webminer what is webminer webminer is a database of datasets used to study gene expression patterns in yeast and was developed by max heiman while at ucsf sgd began hosting webminer in march 2003 all the data in webminer is freely available from sgd or published works cited in webminer webminer makes it easy to perform sophisticated searches by organizing some of the vast wealth of published genomic data under one roof webminer includes a variety of information about every orf in the yeast genome its promoter the protein it encodes and how its mrna levels change under many different conditions we hope that by mining these databases in creative ways you will learn more than you could from any single dataset introduction and tutorial advanced tips and tricks source code and how it works how to cite webminer expression connection search page sgd home send question to sgd 1 pick a dataset datasets cell cycle chromosome structure stress response and drug treatment exp file_descriptions gene deletions gene overexpression mating and mating type meiosis metabolism orf information ploidy signal transduction non mating transcriptional machinery 2 choose the experiments you re interested in experiments available dataset description experiment description status reference go to this paper's website pubmed entry full text on the next page you will pick parameters to search these datasets experiments selected webminer is copyright 2000 by max heiman send a message to sgd curators
