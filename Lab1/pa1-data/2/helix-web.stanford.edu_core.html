defining average core structures defining average core structures this project supported by nih nlm 05652 is part of the helix group at stanford school of medicine please address inquiries to russ altman stanford edu i summary of project goals proteins have long been clustered into families such as the globins or the immunoglobulins members of protein families tend to have similar overall folds but differences in their detailed structure the classification of the entire protein data bank using protein families has recently been attempted by a number of groups moreover the number of protein structures in the whole data bank and in some families in particular is now quite large and is rapidly increasing a recent estimate puts the total number of chains at 3000 increasing by about one a day and in the protein data bank there are now over 15 distinctly different globin structures and over 20 different immunoglobulin structures consequently it has become desirable even necessary to summarize the common structural features within a family whilst separating out the variable ones one of the most basic commonalities shared by each member in a family of structures is a set of atoms which occupy the same relative positions in space our focus here is in identifying this set of atoms and then in characterizing it statistically we show how to construct an average core structure from a protein family in such a way that the average is unbiased and the resulting structure has acceptable stereochemistry we then show how this core structure can be used to characterize the structural variability within a family to define the average relative orientation of domains in multi domain complexes and to develop new measures of similarity between members of the same structural family we illustrate our ideas through application to the two archetypal protein families the all a helical globins and the all b sheet immunoglobulins for both families we find an average structural core that is biologically relevant subsequently we use the globin core to illustrate our calculation of a better rms and to highlight the differences between family classifications based on structure and those based on sequence we use the immunoglobulin core to show how our procedure can be adapted to dealing with large assemblies our method for defining regions of low structural variation is also useful for the analysis of structures solved nmr spectroscopy and generated by molecular dynamics since both techniques produce an ensemble of structures in a sense a family of very similar structures we have applied our algorithm to the nmr structures reported for trypsin inhibitor and examined the distribution the actual atoms about the core structure the representations used by our algorithm were initially developed for calculating structure from nmr data ii project personnel russ altman stanford school of medicine stanford university mark gerstein yale university iii shared data images and software lpfc a library of protein family cores the proteand display program we have published a paper in j mol graphics describing the program proteand which is designed to display various representations of structural uncertainty for macromolecules including overlapping stick drawings ellipsoids of uncertainty and secondary structure accessible volumes these representations are closely related to our computational methodology for computing cores proteand runs on silicon graphics sgi machines sample input files and binary executable code are available in ftp helix ftp stanford edu people altman proteand tar z the average core computed for eight globins we published a paper at the 1994 ismb conference on finding average core structures we make available the coordinates and some other information about the average globin core the average core for the immunoglobins the average core for the immunoglobins is contained in an ftp directory along with some other relevant data the directory can be accessed here the immunoglobulin core calculated from the vl and vh domains is here code for computing average cores code for the core find package is complete the individual scripts and code files can be found in here along with documentation for the software package iv references pubmed references to papers for this project helix research at stanford school of medicine contact russ altman stanford edu updated march 10 2004
