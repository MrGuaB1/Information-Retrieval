performance analysis and visualization of parallel systems using simos and rivet a case study performance analysis and visualization of parallel systems using simos and rivet a case study robert bosch chris stolte gordon stoll mendel rosenblum and pat hanrahan computer science department stanford university in proceedings of the sixth annual symposium on high performance computer architecture abstract in this paper we present an evolving system for the analysis and visualization of parallel application performance on shared memory multiprocessors our system couples simos a complete machine simulator with rivet a powerful visualization environment this system demonstrates how visualization is necessary to realize the full power of simulation for performance analysis we identify several features required of the visualization system including flexibility exploratory interaction techniques and data aggregation schemes we demonstrate the effectiveness of this parallel analysis and visualization system with a case study we developed two visualizations within rivet to study the argus parallel rendering library focusing on the memory system and process scheduling activity of argus respectively using these visualizations we uncovered several unexpected interactions between argus and the underlying operating system the results of the analysis led to changes that greatly improved its performance and scalability argus had previously been unable to scale beyond 26 processors after analysis and modification it achieved linear speedup up to 45 processors postscript 3 mb gzipped 9 mb uncompressed color postscript 3 mb gzipped 11 mb uncompressed powerpoint presentation 1 mb robert bosch last modified thu jan 20 11 44 42 pst 2000
