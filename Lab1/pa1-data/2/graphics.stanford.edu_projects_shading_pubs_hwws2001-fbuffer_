the f buffer a rasterization order fifo buffer for multi pass rendering the f buffer a rasterization order fifo buffer for multi pass rendering william r mark kekoa proudfoot proceedings of siggraph eurographics workshop on graphics hardware 2001 abstract multi pass rendering is a common method of virtualizing graphics hardware to overcome limited resources most current multi pass rendering techniques use the rgba framebuffer to store intermediate results between each pass this method of storing intermediate results makes it difficult to correctly render partially transparent surfaces and reduces the performance of shaders that need to preserve more than one intermediate result between passes we propose an alternative approach to storing intermediate results that solves these problems this approach stores intermediate colors or other values that are generated by a rendering pass in a fifo buffer as the values exit the fragment pipeline on a subsequent pass the contents of the fifo buffer are fed into the top of the fragment pipeline we refer to this fifo buffer as a fragment stream buffer or f buffer because this approach has the effect of associating intermediate results with particular rasterization fragments rather than with an x y location in the framebuffer implementing an f buffer requires some changes to current mainstream graphics architectures but these changes can be minor we describe the design space associated with implementing an f buffer and compare the f buffer to recirculating pipeline designs we implement f buffers in the mesa software renderer and demonstrate our programmable shading system running on top of this renderer paper adobe pdf format 92 k talk html slides
