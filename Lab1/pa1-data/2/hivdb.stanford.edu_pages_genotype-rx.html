hiv drug resistance database stanford university hiv drug resistance database a curated public database designed to represent store and analyze the divergent forms of data underlying hiv drug resistance home genotype rx genotype pheno genotype clinical hiv db program genotype treatment correlations queries 1 treatment profiles protease inhibitors rt inhibitors 2 mutation profiles protease mutations rt mutations 3 detailed treatment queries protease inhibitors rt inhibitors integrase inhibitors 4 detailed mutation queries protease mutations rt mutations integrase mutations 5 advanced queries protease rt data summaries 1 mutation prevalence according to subtype and treatment mutation prevalence graphical summary of protease rt in mutations 2 downloadable dataset download protease rt & integrase genotype treatment dataset treatment profiles mutation frequencies at each position of protease or rt according to subtype and treatment users can also select a reference profile usually viruses from untreated person for comparison the results are graphical protease inhibitors rt inhibitors mutation profiles users specify a particular position the program then returns a separate table for each observed mutation at that position the table entries show the prevalence of the mutation in untreated persons in persons receiving the relevant drug class pis for protease nrtis and nnrtis for rt and in persons receiving each of the drugs of the relevant drug class significant differences between the prevalence of a mutation in treated and untreated persons is calculated using a chi square test and shown in each row of each table protease inhibitors rt inhibitors detailed treatment queries users specify treatment and subtype information the query then returns a table of virus isolates meeting the selected criteria the table contains links to medline author yr column and genbank accession column the sequences in the table can also be viewed as a sequence alignment downloaded in fasta format or viewed with the graphical treatment profile format users can specify the number of drugs of a particular class specific drugs and specific drug combinations users can also specify the manner win which the mutation data and treatment data are displayed in the table users can also filter their results according to a variety of criteria protease inhibitors rt inhibitors integrase inhibitors detailed mutation queries users specify one or more mutations and subtype information users can retrieve all sequences containing the specified mutations or only those sequences exactly matching the query then returns a table of virus isolates meeting the selected criteria the table contains links to medline author yr column and genbank accession column the sequences in the table can also be viewed as a sequence alignment downloaded in fasta format or viewed with the graphical treatment profile format protease mutations rt mutations integrase mutations advanced queries retrieve pairs of sequences that one was obtained before and the other was obtained after a selected treatment pre and post selected protease inhibitors pre and post selected rt inhibitors retrieve pairs of sequences that were developing or regressing selected mutations pre and post selected protease inhibitors pre and post selected rt inhibitors retrieve sequences of isolates containing or not containing selected mutations with or without selected protease mutations with or without selected rt mutations mutation prevalence according to subtype and treatment summary tables listing the prevalence of each mutation according to subtype and drug class experience users can adjust the threshold for the minimum prevalence of a mutation required for it to appear in the summary tables users can also choose whether or not mutations present as part of electrophoretic mixtures should be counted as a mutation or ignored mutation prevalence is indicated by the superscripted number following each mutation each mutation is also a hyperlink to a separate web page with detailed information on each isolate containing the mutation and meeting the appropriate subtype and treatment criteria graphical summary of protease mutations rt mutations and in mutations shows the mutation prevalence according to subtype in untreated persons this work was based on a review of the published literature from the stanford hiv drug resistance database and collaborative efforts of the non b workgroup database citing database terms of use faqs user guide & database documents database statistics news resources hiv treatment websites rt protease and integrase structures additional resources team who we are & how to contact us publications acknowledgements 1998 2012 all rights reserved questions contact hivdb
