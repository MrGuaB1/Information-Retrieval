the openproof project at csli heterogeneous reasoning the openproof project at csli research hyperproof's proof system the proof system in hyperproof is an extension of the fitch style deductive system presented in the language of first order logic because of this hyperproof can be used as a simple proof checker for instructors using this text to teach a standard introductory course in logic this has the value of giving students instant feedback about whether they are applying inference rules correctly the full proof system however is both more powerful and more natural than ordinary syntactic systems here for example is a simple hyperproof problem one in which students are asked first whether they can identify which block is named a and second whether it follows from the given information that there are two or more large tetrahedra the given sentences tell us that block b is a dodecahedron that b is to the left of block a from our perspective and that block a is large note that we already know that one of the tetrahedra the one farthest back is large if you solved this problem in your head you probably went through the following reasoning first since b is a dodecahedron it must be one or the other of the two dodecahedra in the sixth column in either case block a which must be farther right than b has to be the tetrahedron of undetermined size since we know that a is large we can conclude that there are two large tetrahedra the hyperproof solution to this problem corresponds exactly to this intuitive reasoning in contrast if this problem were to be translated completely into the first order language the corresponding proof would be several hundred steps long if you would like to see a step by step illustration of the hyperproof solution click here back 1 2 3 4 next the openproof project csli stanford university csli publications all pages and images on this web site are copyright material the openproof project 2005 2012 version equinox11
