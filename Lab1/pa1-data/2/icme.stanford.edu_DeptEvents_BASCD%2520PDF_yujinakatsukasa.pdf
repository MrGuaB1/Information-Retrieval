abstract yuji nakatsukasa the total cost of an algorithm is a combination of its arithmetic cost and communication cost recent page 1 abstract yuji nakatsukasa the total cost of an algorithm is a combination of its arithmetic cost and communication cost recently there has been considerable progress in the development of linear algebra algorithms that minimize communication however the reduction in communication cost sometimes comes at the expense of significantly more arithmetic this includes the existing communication minimizing algorithms for computing the symmetric eigendecomposition and the singular value decomposition svd these algorithms also suffer from potential instability in this talk i will describe algorithms for these two decompositions that minimize both communication and arithmetic up to a constant factor smaller than 3 the essential cost for each of these algorithms is in performing qr decompositions of which we require no more than 6 for the symmetric eigenproblem and 12 for the svd i will establish backward stability of these algorithms under mild assumptions preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate their efficiency
