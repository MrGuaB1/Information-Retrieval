testing multicast between sites page 1 testing multicast between sites this describes how to use software developed by steve senger to test whether multicast is working between sites the executables are called msender and mrecver there is a windows and linux version these are command line tools in windows you will need to open a command window in linux you can use a terminal window the msender command sends packets to a specified address and port here is the syntax for how we use the command msender addr 233.0 32.48 port 36048 ttl 70 source verbose pace 1000000 addr the multicast address port port number ttl the time to live value for the packet source specifies that you are sending data verbose prints output to the screen pace time between packets in microseconds the mrecver command listens for traffic on a specified address mrecver addr 233.0 32.48 port 36048 sink verbose the sender and receiver need to agree on an address and port value for the testing session when multicast is enabled then the receiver will see the list of packets received on the screen multicast needs to be tested in both directions to ensure that the network is configured correctly notes some setting in the stanford network causes the first packet to be listed multiple times when receiving data normally 3 or 4
