about genome home pande group chemistry department stanford university the pande group works on theory and simulations of how proteins rna and nanoscale synthetic polymers fold we wrote the client and server code for the genome home project we run and maintain virtually all aspects of the project in addition to doing the scientific work that goes into and comes out of genome home vijay pande principal investigator stefan larson lead researcher jeremy england designability project guha jayachandran g h2 0 development sid elmer heteropolymer design vishal vaidynathan design algorithms amit garg homology modeling database special thanks to all the contributors and users involved with the folding home project which paved the way for genome home desjarlais lab chemistry department penn state university the sequence design algorithm of the genome home code is known as spa sequence prediction algorithm this algorithm was developed and coded by john desjarlais formerly at the chemistry department penn state university cosm the cosm project has made significant contributions to genome home by developing the tools mithral cs sdk necessary to build the client and server code especially the networking and platform independence routines adam beberg is the main force behind cosm although there are several people involved in its development
