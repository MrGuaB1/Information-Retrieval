e coli plasmid vector pkm2 complete pkm2 vector ig sequence link general plasmid ds dna 4157 bp functions promoter analysis selection copy number hosts e coli suppliers misc comments these data and their annotation were supplied to genbank by will gilbert under the auspices of the genbank currator program assembled from pko2 and phage lambda by f pfeiffer this is a promoter probe vector the promoterless galk gene is used as selectable marker translationsal stop codons in all reading frames are present on a 11 bp oligonucleotide before the galkgene also a polylinker was cloned before this gene in addition the lambda tr1 transcription terminator was inserted before the galk gene to allow measurement of very strong promoters due to read through transcription pkm2 does not contain the 4 bp deletion present in pko2 however in genbank synpko2 and synpkm2 have been mixed up thus synpko2 is given as a parent parents pkm1 ecogalk pbr322 pko 2 lambda siblings descendents ncbi entrez link return to vector homepage
