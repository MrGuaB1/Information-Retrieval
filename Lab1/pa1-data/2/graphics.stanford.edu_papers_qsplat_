qsplat a multiresolution point rendering system for large meshes qsplat a multiresolution point rendering system for large meshes szymon rusinkiewicz marc levoy presented at siggraph 2000 132 ms 215 ms 722 ms 8308 ms abstract advances in 3d scanning technologies have enabled the practical creation of meshes with hundreds of millions of polygons traditional algorithms for display simplification and progressive transmission of meshes are impractical for data sets of this size we describe a system for representing and progressively displaying these meshes that combines a multiresolution hierarchy based on bounding spheres with a rendering system based on points a single data structure is used for view frustum culling backface culling level of detail selection and rendering the representation is compact and can be computed quickly making it suitable for large data sets our implementation written for use in a large scale 3d digitization project launches quickly maintains a user settable interactive frame rate regardless of object complexity or camera position yields reasonable image quality during motion and refines progressively when idle to a high final image quality we have demonstrated the system on scanned models containing hundreds of millions of samples full paper as pdf 10 pages 3248916 bytes copyright 2000 acm the qsplat software page is here slides from the siggraph 2000 talk are here smr cs stanford edu
