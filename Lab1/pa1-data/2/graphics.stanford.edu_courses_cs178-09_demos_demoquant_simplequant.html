demo of quantization levels demo of quantization levels cs 178 digital photography spring quarter 2009 marc levoy the first test image top row is synthetic so it should require the most number of bits to look good to my eye the solid glass cone lying on its side upper right corner and the smoke begin to exhibit quantization artifacts ie contouring at 5 bits the second test image is an optically scanned photograph taken by a film camera the optical scanner had a gamma of 1.0 thereby producing a file whose pixel values are proportional to luminance the third row of the table shows quantization of this image to my eye it begins to show quantization artifacts at 5 bits but less severely so than the synthetic image probably because of film or digitization noise look in particular at the top surface of the leading edge of the raft the third image is an optically scanned hand painted cartoon background to my eye it looks fine at 5 bits but begins to show artifacts at 4 bits this reduction in the number of bits is at least partially due to the more random nature of the hand painting finally the fourth image is an optically scanned pencil drawing it does fine down to 3 bits due mainly to the narrow spatial extent of the zone of antialiasing ie of midrange gray pixels over which the quantization occurs this same property allows text to be antialiased using few bits original source quantized versions computer graphics 6 bits 5 bits 4 bits scanned photographic print 6 bits 5 bits 4 bits scanned acrylic painting 6 bits 5 bits 4 bits scanned pencil drawing 4 bits 3 bits 2 bits levoy cs stanford edu copyright 2009 marc levoy last update april 13 2009 09 31 30 pm
