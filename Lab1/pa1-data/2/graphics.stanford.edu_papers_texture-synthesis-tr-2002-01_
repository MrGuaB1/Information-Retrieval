order independent texture synthesis order independent texture synthesis li yi wei and marc levoy technical report tr 2002 01 computer science department stanford university april 2002 a b c cache access footprints for various request patterns a a single pixel b a set of uniform random pixels generated by a poisson disk process and c a circular request pattern within each group the images show the contents of the cache at different generations and different pyramid levels with higher resolution on the top and later generation on the left abstract search based texture synthesis algorithms are sensitive to the order in which texture samples are generated different synthesis orders yield different textures unfortunately most polygon rasterizers and ray tracers do not guarantee the order with which surfaces are sampled to circumvent this problem textures are synthesized beforehand at some maximum resolution and rendered using texture mapping we describe a search based texture synthesis algorithm in which samples can be generated in arbitrary order yet the resulting texture remains identical the key to our algorithm is a pyramidal representation in which each texture sample depends only on a fixed number of neighboring samples at each level of the pyramid the bottom coarsest level of the pyramid consists of a noise image which is small and predetermined when a sample is requested by the renderer all samples on which it depends are generated at once using this approach samples can be generated in any order to make the algorithm efficient we propose storing texture samples and their dependents in a pyramidal cache although the first few samples are expensive to generate there is substantial reuse so subsequent samples cost less fortunately most rendering algorithms exhibit good coherence so cache reuse is high available information paper in pdf format 0.9 mb liyiwei graphics stanford edu
