supplemental figure 4 top supplemental figure 4 upper half of figure lower half hierarchical cluster analysis of genes and experiments with different dht treatment regimens shown are the 2862 transcripts that distinguish between normal genital skin fibroblasts and gonadal fibroblasts from 46 xy female ais patients and between proliferating and confluent fibroblasts the color code in the dendrogram depicts the origin of the fibroblast cultures the gray and white bars on top of the cluster indicate the proliferation state of the samples on the right the regions of the cluster diagram are indicated which differentiate between normal and ais derived fibroblasts and proliferating and confluent cells respectively no differences in transcript levels could be discerned between dht treated and control cells in either normal foreskin fibroblasts or fibroblasts from ais affected 46 xy females the scale ranges from 8 to 8 in log2 space complete dataset from which figure 3 was created
