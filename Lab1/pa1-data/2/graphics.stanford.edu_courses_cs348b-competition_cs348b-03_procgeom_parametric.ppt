parametric shapes & lighting parametric shapes & lighting jared jackson stanford cs 348b june 6 2003 or how i went to stanford graduate school to learn basket weaving shapes from parametric paths a parametric path in multiple dimensions requires only one variable circle u 0 to 1 x u sin 2 pi u y u cos 2 pi u z u 0 shapes from parametric paths mapping a 2d path along the 3d path gives a 3d parametric shape for a torus trace a circle along a parametric path this requires that we know the normal to the path shapes parametric cc create a shape using s expressions for x y z dx dy dz ex sin 2 pi u sin mult 2 mult pi x other parameters include radius of the 2d shape twist angle of the 2d shape min and max of u number of samples to take along u parametric torus surface parametric x mult 2 cos mult 2 mult x pi y mult 2 sin mult 2 mult x pi z 0 dx mult 1 sin mult 2 mult x pi dy cos mult 2 mult x pi dz 0 radius 0.3 samples 20 min 0 max 1 other parameters shapes there are several built in 2d shapes circle tube square box disc star and more other parameters complex shapes shapes can also be described as a 2d parametric path using s expressions shape complex cx sub 1 pow x 3 cy x csamples 20 other parameters radius the radius is a scaling factor on the 2d shape that can also be specified as an s expression radius 0.2 radius add 0.3 mult 0.1 cos mult 2 mult x pi other parameters twist the twist parameter rotates the 2d shape within its plane before mapping it along the path twist cos mult 2 mult x pi basket weaving x u r1 cos 2 pi u y u 0.75 u z u r1 sin 2 pi u radius u 0.35 parametric lights lights can also follow a 3d parametric path the sample points then act as point light sources light intensity is divided across the number of sample points parametric lights a final image
