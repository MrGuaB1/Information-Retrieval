unwrapping and visualizing inscribed surfaces unwrapping and visualizing cuneiform tablets authors sean anderson seander cs stanford edu marc levoy ieee computer graphics and applications vol 22 no 6 november december 2002 pp 82 88 abstract thousands of historically revealing cuneiform clay tablets which were inscribed in mesopotamia millenia ago still exist today visualizing cuneiform writing is important when deciphering what is written on the tablets it is also important when reproducing the tablets in papers and books unfortunately scholars have found photographs to be an inadequate visualization tool for two reasons first the text wraps around the sides of some tablets so a single viewpoint is insufficient second a raking light will illuminate some textual features but will leave others shadowed or invisible because they are either obscured by features on the tablet or are nearly aligned with the lighting direction we present solutions to these problems by first creating a high resolution 3d computer model from laser range data then unwrapping and flattening the inscriptions on the model to a plane allowing us to represent them as a scalar displacement map and finally rendering this map non photorealistically using accessibility and curvature coloring the output of this semi automatic process enables all of a tablet's text to be perceived in a single concise image our technique can also be applied to other types of inscribed surfaces including bas reliefs available information paper with our formatting with high res images pdf file 17 mb with mid res images pdf file 12 mb with low res images pdf file 3 mb paper as it appears in ieee cg&a some changes in wording from ours with mid res images pdf file 2.5 mb with very low res images pdf file 650 kb
