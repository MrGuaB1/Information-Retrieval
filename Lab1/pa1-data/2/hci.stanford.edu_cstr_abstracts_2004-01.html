spatiotemporal sampling and interpolation for dense camera arrays spatiotemporal sampling and interpolation for dense camera arrays bennett wilburn stanford university neel joshi stanford university katherine chou stanford university marc levoy stanford university mark horowitz stanford university submitted to siggraph 2004 the 96 camera array used for this work abstract we explore the application of dense camera arrays to view interpolation across space and time for dynamic scenes large video camera arrays are typically synchronized but we show that staggering camera triggers provides a much richer set of samples on which to base the interpolation we do not increase the total number of samples we merely distribute them more effectively in time we use optical flow to interpolate new views within this framework we find that the dense space time sampling provided by staggered timing improves the robustness of the interpolation we present an novel optical flow method that combines a plane plus parallax framework with knowledge of camera spatial and temporal offsets to generate flow fields for virtual images at new space time locations we present results interpolating video from a 96 camera light field using this method paper adobe acrobat pdf 3.5 mb mpeg 4 video 13mb
