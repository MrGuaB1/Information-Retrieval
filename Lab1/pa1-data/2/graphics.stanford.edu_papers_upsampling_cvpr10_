upsampling range data in dynamic environments cvpr 2010 upsampling range data in dynamic environments jennifer dolson jongmin baek christian plagemann sebastian thrun cvpr 2010 abstract we present a flexible method for fusing information from optical and range sensors based on an accelerated high dimensional filtering approach our system takes as input a sequence of monocular camera images as well as a stream of sparse range measurements as obtained from a laser or other sensor system in contrast with existing approaches we do not assume that the depth and color data streams have the same data rates or that the observed scene is fully static our method produces a dense high resolution depth map of the scene automatically generating confidence values for every interpolated depth point we describe how to integrate priors on object shape motion and appearance and how to achieve an efficient implementation using parallel processing hardware such as gpus paper adobe acrobat pdf 1.4 mb videos example of processing the highway1 dataset avi video 4.1 mb example of processing the synthetic1 dataset avi video 9.8 mb data sets one download all 8 data sets individual data sets highway1 highway2 avenue1 avenue2 synthetic1 synthetic2 synthetic3 synthetic4 implementations note all analysis in the paper uses the gpu version of the algorithm here is the gpu implementation as described in the paper which runs on linux with nvidia's cuda installed in theory it should also run on windows but that theory has not been tested there's a readme file and sample makefile included download here is the cpu implementation also with a readme and sample makefile download for image processing operations and data visualization we recommend imagestack imagestack also includes a more general joint bilateral filter implmentation for the cpu written by andrew adams for more information about the original versions of the data structures used in our gpu and cpu code see fast high dimensional filtering using the permutohedral lattice and gaussian kd trees for fast high dimensional filtering
