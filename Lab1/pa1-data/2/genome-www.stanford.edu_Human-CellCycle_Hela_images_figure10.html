human cell cycle hela cells figures supplemental figure 10 supplemental figure 10 the proliferation clusters and their expression during the cell cycle figure 4 with all gene names a cell cycle regulation of the breast tumor proliferation cluster the expression patterns of the 112 clones in the breast tumor proliferation cluster perou et al 2000 were examined in the cell cycle dataset along with their expression in breast tumors and cell lines as described in figure 4 the clones are ordered by their peak expression during the cell cycle as in figure 3a such that each row corresponds to a single clone the order of the breast tumor samples based on hierarchical clustering using 1753 genes is as previously described perou et al 2000 b cell cycle regulation of lymphoma proliferation cluster as above the genes ie rows are ordered by peak expression during the cell cycle the order of the tumors based on hierarchical clustering using a larger dataset is as previously published alizadeh et al 2000
