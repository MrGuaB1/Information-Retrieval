e coli plasmid vector pplc24 incomplete pplc24 vector ig sequence link general plasmid ds dna 3143 bp functions cloning selection copy number hosts e coli m5219 e coli suppliers atcc misc comments the following unique restriction sites are found on this vector separated by bp approx bgli 100 bamhi 900 ecori 600 xhoi 300 smai 250 hindiii 1650 1 restriction digests of the clone give the following sizes kb ecori 3.1 pvui bamhi 1.7 1.4 bgli 3.1 psti 3.1 hindiii 3.1 atcc staff the orientation of the pl promoter is clockwise with respect to the plasmid ori 1 this vector was constructed from pplc28 atcc 31696 by inserting a 431 bp ecori bamhi fragment coding for the ribosome binding site and the first 98 amino acids of the ms2 replicase from pms2 7 into pplc28 1 atg is in phase with gat from the bamhi site aag from the hindiii site tta from the mstii site cgc from the nrui site & gct from the espi site personal communication the vectors pplc28 atcc 31696 and pplc24 atcc 31697 with the pl promoter oriented clockwise relative to the plasmid origin of replication plated equally well at 28c and 42c when in e coli k 12 deltah1 hosts 1 e coli m5219 is e coli k 12 m72 lac am trp am rpsl lambda ci857 deltah1 bio252 deltah1 removes part of cro and all genes to the right of cro bio252 removes all genes to the left of ciii at 42c n is expressed from the chromosome 1 translation from the ms2 replicase is colinear with transcription from the pl promoter and thus is under pl control 1 the vectors pplc28 atcc 31696 and pplc24 atcc 31697 with the pl promoter oriented clockwise relative to the plasmid origin of replication plated showed reduced plating efficiency in e coli m5219 at 42c under antibiotic selection 1 this vector is used for expression of fused proteins with ms2 polymerase 1 medium is 1227 lb plus ampicillin parents siblings descendents ncbi entrez link return to vector homepage
