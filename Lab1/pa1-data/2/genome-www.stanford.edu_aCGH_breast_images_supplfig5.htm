supplemental figure 5 measuring x chromosomal dna copy number variation genomic dna samples from 45 xo 46 xx 47 xxx 48 xxxx and 49 xxxxx cell lines were separately labeled cy5 and compared with 46 xx dna labeled with cy3 using cdna microarrays containing human cdnas representing 6691 different unigene clusters of which 227 3.4 were x chromosomal the graph shows a plot of the mean 1 sd moving average symmetric 5 nearest neighbors fluorescence ratios of autosomal cdnas black circles and x chromosomal cdnas grey diamonds from each experiment against the number of x chromosomes mean 1 sd moving average fluorescence ratios for x chromosomal cdnas are as follows xo vs xx 0.75 0.67 0.85 xx vs xx 1.02 0.95 1.08 xxx vs xx 1.25 1.16 1.34 xxxx vs xx 1.39 1.27 1.52 xxxxx vs xx 1.60 1.43 1.79 lines were fitted using standard regression analysis low level gains and losses are readily identifiable see also supplemental information estimating significance of altered fluorescence ratios note that these experiments are likely to underestimate the performance of our cdna microarray cgh due to cross hybridization of x chromosomal sequences to other chromosomes suppl ref 1
