mapping genetic risk of disease across the world mapping genetic risk of disease across the world by erik corona proper understanding of the effects of human migration on genetic risk of disease is paramount for addressing these risks in today's diverse populations the following visualizations display genetic data across 51 worldwide populations provided by the human genome diversity project this work was completed in the butte lab at stanford university genetic risk world map plot disease risk worldwide displays population risks geographically including migration patterns this map was key to discovering that migration is associated with decreased genetic risk of type 2 diabetes genetic risk human relationship map plot disease by worldwide population relationships displays risks in contrast to genetic similarities and geographic vicinity internet explorer does not fully support this visualization any other browser recommened further details and results about mapping global genetic risks will be published in the near future tweet submit to reddit direct questions or comments to erik corona learn more about me
