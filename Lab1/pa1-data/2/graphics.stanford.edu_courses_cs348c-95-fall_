cs 348c modeling in computer graphics cs 348c modeling in computer graphics fall 1995 not offered fall 1996 cs 348c has traditionally been a cooperative reading class where students and coordinator explore an area of computer graphics this year cs 348c comprises a mixture of 1 lectures by the coordinator covering the essentials of geometric modeling and 2 cooperative reading and student presentations on the modeling of natural phenomena the first part of the class covers material usually taught in cs 348a a class not offered this year in particular we primarily cover representations of curves using bezier curves and splines we also discuss rational curves and nurbs surface representations wavelets and quaternions short programming and or written assignments and hands on use of custom class software and the softimage 3d modeling and animation system are used to visualize the mathematical theory of splines the second part of the class covers the modeling of select natural phenomena and processes we are concentrating on recent work from siggraph 93 and later on topics such as lighting and fireworks plants and trees animal movement atmospheric and subsurface light scattering fire and smoke pearlescent surfaces animal skin glare effects silver tarnish drape of cloth students study individual topics and present representative papers to the rest of the class also a programming project provides the opportunity for in depth exploration of a student chosen topic finally a field trip to pacific data images brings the students in contact with a commercial application of the material covered in class table of contents basic information readings on geometric modeling proposed topics on natural phenomena and processes requirements software student profiles schedule and lecture notes student projects on line forms registration form due on fri 9 29 5 00p signups for project proposal meetings due on fri 10 20 5 00p signups for project progress meetings due on fri 11 24 5 00p teaching evaluation form please submit anytime and as often as you wish to other useful links courses in computer graphics computer graphics laboratory computer science department stanford university last update 6 december 1995 by apostolos toli lerios tolis cs stanford edu
