a hierarchical method for aligning warped meshes a hierarchical method for aligning warped meshes leslie ikemoto stanford university natasha gelfand stanford university marc levoy stanford university appears in fourth international conference on 3d imaging and modeling 3dim october 6 10 2003 banff alberta canada abstract current alignment algorithms for registering range data captured from a 3d scanner assume that the range data depicts identical geometry taken from different views however in the presence of scanner calibration errors the data will be slightly warped these warps often cause current alignment algorithms to converge slowly find the wrong alignment or even diverge in this paper we present a method for aligning warped range data represented by polygon meshes our strategy can be characterized as a coarse to fine hierarchical approach where we assume that since the warp is global we can compensate for it by treating each mesh as a collection of smaller piecewise rigid sections which can translate and rotate with respect to each other we split the meshes subject to several constraints in order to ensure that the resulting sections converge reliably paper pdf 8 mb powerpoint slides 9.5 mb figure 1 marble fragment of the forma urbis romae left computer rendering of mesh from alignment and merging under incorrect calibration left inset blurring of the map due to incorrect alignment plot shows that a sample incision is shallow with a depth of 0.25 mm and incorrectly shows two minima right results of our technique on same input scan right inset the blurring is greatly reduced and the depth of the incision measures 0.5 mm which is more consistent with the approximate depth of the forma urbis incisions figure 2 the face of michelangelo's david top alignment and merging under incorrect calibration the lips exhibit gross misalignments on the order of 1.9 mm bottom our results the artifacts in the lips have been greatly reduced
