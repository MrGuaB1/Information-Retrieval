comparing time distance pipeline results from hmi and mdi full disk page 1 comparing time distance pipeline results from hmi and mdi full disk page 2 we select a same period of mdi and hmi for comparison 16 00 23 59ut march 27 page 3 outgoing ingoing travel time difference with annulus range of 1.08 1.32 degrees page 4 outgoing ingoing travel times annulus of 0.60 0.96 deg page 5 outgoing ingoing travel times annulus of 1.08 1.32 deg page 6 outgoing ingoing travel times annulus of 1.44 1.80 deg page 7 outgoing ingoing travel times annulus of 1.92 2.40 deg page 8 west going east going travel times averaged over all latitudes page 9 comparing sound speed and velocity 0 1mm mdi hmi page 10 comparing sound speed and velocity 1 3 mm mdi hmi page 11 comparing sound speed and velocity 3 5mm mdi hmi page 12 comparing sound speed and velocity 5 8mm mdi hmi page 13 comparing residual rotational speed page 14 comparing meridional flow speed page 15 conclusion clearly the pipeline code for the smallest annulus does not work very well in mdi data and works even worse for hmi data binned down to mdi full disk resolution it is very possible that hmi data or the remapping procedures have problems that have caused some anomalies for the smallest annulus measurements the comparisons of measured outgoing and ingoing travel time differences show that the measured travel times are different for these two instruments the inverted local scale flow structures are quite similar despite above
