welcome to the reijo pera lab at stanford university research home hot links hesc protocols news & events job openings our research is focused on the genetics of human embryo and germ cell oocyte and sperm development we identified and characterized novel genes that are required for formation and or differentiation of premeiotic germ cells some of the proteins encoded by these genes such as dazl deleted in azoospermia like pumilio and nanos are homologs of germ plasm components in lower organisms that are required for germ cell formation and differentiation in males and females subsequently our analysis of these genes led us to human embryonic stem cell biology as we tracked gene function to the birth of germ cells and sought a developmental system to manipulate genes against a human more about us lab activities journal club sunday 18 mar 2012 10 57 15 pdt add a photo an h9 human embryonic stem cell colony stained positive for oct 4 green ssea 4 red and dapi blue home about us links members publications protocols contact us feedback copyright 2007 rpl stanford university
