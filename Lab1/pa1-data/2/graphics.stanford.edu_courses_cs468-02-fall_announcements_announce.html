cs 468 introduction to computational topology new class for fall quarter 2002 introduction to computational topology listed under cs 468 geometric algorithms seminar instructor afra zomorodian meetings wednesdays 12 30 2 pm in gates 392 description the emerging field of computational topology utilizes theory from topology and the power of computing to solving problems in diverse fields recent applications include computer graphics computer aided design cad and structural biology in each case we are interested in understanding the intrinsic shape of some real or abstract space the primary goal of the course is to present basic concepts from topology and morse theory to enable a non specialist to grasp and participate in current research in computational topology as such this course will not be a readings course in computational topology i will present material from a computer scientist's point of view focusing on computational challenges and presenting algorithms and data structures when appropriate near the end of the course we will examine recent advances in the area the course combines concepts from point set topology algebraic topology group theory differential manifolds morse theory and normal surface theory prerequisites i assume mathematical sophistication and familiarity with programming however the course is designed for a novice in the area the grade will be based on class participation and a final project which can be either an implementation or a survey paper class requirements the course will not have any homework or tests the grade will be based on class participation and a final project which can be either an implementation or a survey paper i will provide a list of possible projects early in the quarter literature i will be providing notes for the class as well as survey articles and supplementary readings when appropriate more information first meeting will be on september 25th see course website for more details
