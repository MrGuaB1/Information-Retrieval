identification and validation of cognitive design principles for automated generation of assembly instructions identification and validation of cognitive design principles for automated generation of assembly instructions julie heiser stanford university doantam phan stanford university maneesh agrawala microsoft research barbara tversky stanford university pat hanrahan stanford university abstract designing effective instructions for everyday products is challenging one reason is that designers lack a set of design principles for producing visually comprehensible and accessible instructions we describe an approach for identifying such design principles through experiments investigating the production preference and comprehension of assembly instructions for furniture we instantiate these principles into an algorithm that automatically generates assembly instructions finally we perform a user study comparing our computer generated instructions to factory provided and highly rated hand designed instructions our results indicate that the computer generated instructions informed by our cognitive design principles significantly reduce assembly time an average of 35 and error by 50 details of the experimental methodology and the implementation of the automated system are described figure 1 an picture of a user assembling the tv stand by referring to our computer generated instructions figure 2 time to assemble tv stand by instruction set instructions generated by automated system m 10.2 se 929 outperformed the top rated instructions m 18.9 se 2.81 from experiment 1 and the factory made instructions that accompanied the tv stand m 16.04 se 2.9 paper adobe acrobat pdf 600k adobe acrobat pdf 13m powerpoint avi 2004 presentation 14mb
