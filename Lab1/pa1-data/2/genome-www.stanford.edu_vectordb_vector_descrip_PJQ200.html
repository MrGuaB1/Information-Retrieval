broad host range e coli plasmid vector pjq200 incomplete pjq200 vector ig sequence link general plasmid ds dna 4900 bp functions cloning integrating selection copy number hosts e coli suppliers atcc misc comments suicide vector permitting gene replacement and mobilization into a wide range of gram negative bacteria allows positive selection for integration replicates only in enterobacteria and so functions as a suicide vector in other gram negative hosts when induced by media containing 5 sucrose sacb is lethal in a wide range of gram negative bacteria and thus permits selection for loss of the vector a single bglii site within the gentamicin resistance gene gtmr allows insertion of other resistance genes eg as a bamhi cassette the order of the major features of the plasmid is gtmr smai p15a traj orit sacb 1 deposited by mf hynes grwoth media lb plus gentamicin atcc medium number 1885 37c parents siblings descendents return to vector homepage
