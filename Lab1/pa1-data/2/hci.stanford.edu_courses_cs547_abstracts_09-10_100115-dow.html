pcd 1 15 10 dow how prototyping practices affect design results steven dow stanford hci group spdow stanford edu seminar on people computers and design stanford university january 15 2010 12 50pm gates b01 design shapes the world we inhabit both digital and physical yet surprisingly often the design process fails to uncover the real needs and desires of people how can designers and developers more effectively prototype my research reflects on five years of building immersive story experiences and examines the creation process through lab experimentation i will describe research on iteration and comparison two key principles for discovering contextual design variables and their interrelationships we found that even under tight time constraints when the common intuition is to stop iterating and start refining iterative prototyping helps designers learn our results also indicate that creating and receiving feedback on multiple prototypes in parallel as opposed to serially leads to more divergent ideation more explicit comparison less investment in a single concept and better overall design performance steven dow is a postdoctoral scholar in the hci group at stanford university where he researches human computer interaction creative problem solving prototyping practices and computing for education and entertainment he is a co recipient of a hasso plattner design thinking research grant 2009 10 he received an ms and phd in human centered computing from the georgia institute of technology and a bs in industrial engineering from university of iowa the talks are open to the public they are in the gates building room b01 in the basement the nearest public parking is in the structure at campus drive and roth way view this talk on line at cs547 on stanford online titles and abstracts for previous years are available by year and by speaker
