assignment 2 sports and action assignment 2 sports and action chynna chynna begay i looked at this requirement as more of a progression going from work to sleep and the steps or rather the change of clothing involved i set the camera on auto with flash in an attempt to keep the colors the same when i would edit later i also prefocused and locked in that focus so the images would be more similar when editing i would set the timer run to my position wait flash change clothing set timer position flash and i did so until i was took all of my planned frames i initially took the pictures with my hair constant but it didn t look like enough of a progression so i switched to taking out my ponytail which i do before i sleep in terms of post production i layered the images and slightly edited the colors previous back to all photos next
