wide area camera calibration using virtual calibration objects xing chen james davis philipp slusallek abstract this paper introduces a method to calibrate a wide area system of unsynchronized cameras with respect to a single global coordinate system the method is simple and does not require the physical construction of a large calibration object the user need only wave an identifiable point in front of all cameras the method generates a rough estimate of camera pose by first performing pair wise structure from motion on observed points and then combining the pair wise registrations into a single coordinate frame using the initial camera pose the moving point can be tracked in world space the path of the point defines a virtual calibration object which can be used to improve the initial estimates of camera pose iterating the above process yields a more precise estimate of both camera pose and the point path experimental results show that it perform s as well as calibration from a physical target in cases where all cameras share some common working volume we then demonstrate its effectiveness in wide area settings by calibrating a system of cameras having non overlapping fields of view a situation where traditional methods cannot be applied directly cvpr 2000 paper pdf 5.5 mb ps 7.3 mb poster from cvpr 2000 pdf 4.9 mb
