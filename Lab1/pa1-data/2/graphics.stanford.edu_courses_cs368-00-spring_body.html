cs368 00 spring main course page spring quarter 99 00 the course is a graduate level introduction to basic techniques used in the design and analysis of efficient geometric algorithms including convexity triangulation sweeping spatial partitioning and point location arrangements and voronoi delaunay diagrams will be discussed in detail with emphasis on recent developments using random sampling methods the course will also cover intersection visibility and range searching problems the focus will be on data structures of general usefulness in geometric computing and the conceptual primitives appropriate for manipulating them the impact of numerical issues in geometric computation will be addressed applications to meshing motion planning visibility preprocessing model based recognition molecular modeling and geographical information systems will be used throughout to motivate the material students in the course can choose between a theoretical and an applied track the difference will be in some of the homeworks the assignments in the theory track will emphasize the mathematical aspects and the analysis techniques those in the applied track will focus on data structure and implementation issues a good undergraduate course in algorithms such as cs161 here at stanford is useful preparation students in the applied track should have some implementation experience with c c++ time tu th 9 30 10 45 am location gates b08 instructor leonidas guibas e mail guibas cs stanford edu office gates 374 650 723 0304 office hours tuesday thursday 11 00 12 00 noon ta julien basch e mail jbasch cs stanford edu office gates 133 650 725 8814 office hours monday 3 00 5 00 pm these pages are maintained by leonidas guibas guibas cs stanford edu last update april 19 2000
