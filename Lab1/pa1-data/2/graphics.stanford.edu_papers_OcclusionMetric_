camera placement considering occlusion for robust motion capture camera placement considering occlusion for robust motion capture xing chen james davis abstract in multi camera tracking systems camera placement can have a significant impact on the overall performance in feature based motion capture systems degradation can come from two major sources low image resolution and target occlusion in order to achieve better tracking and automate the camera placement process a quantitative metric to evaluate the quality of multi camera configurations is needed we propose a quality metric that estimates the error caused by both image resolution and occlusion it includes a probabilistic occlusion model that reflects the dynamic self occlusion of the target using this metric we show the impact of occlusion on optimal camera pose by analyzing several camera configurations finally we show camera placement examples that demonstrate how this metric can be applied toward the automatic design of more accurate and robust tracking systems paper technical report cs tr 2000 07 pdf 191kb selected figures left two cameras constrained to move on an outer sphere try to cover a inner spherical target space the angle with which they intersect the sphere center is q the occlusion and resolution metrics are minimized at different angles center 3d uncertainty vs q considering resolution only right 3d uncertainty vs q considering occlusion only q is from 0 to 180 degrees 3d uncertainty vs number of cameras error due to imager resolution is nearly minimized by only two cameras many more cameras are needed to robust insure against occlusion
