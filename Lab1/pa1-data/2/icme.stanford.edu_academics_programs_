institute for computational and mathematical engineering academics programs icme logo intranet academic programs the institute for computational and mathematical engineering icme has its own ms and ph d programs both programs have a strong foundation in mathematics but are interdisciplinary and students are give a wide choice of disciplines to pursue both within the school of engineering and elsewhere in the university the strength of the program lies within both its core faculty and courses coupled with the opportunities at stanford to study classical areas of the physical sciences and the new emerging areas of business biology information and medicine master of science the ms degree in computational and mathematical engineering may be a terminal degree or a stepping stone to the ph d program a candidate is required to complete a program of 45 units which usually takes between 4 and 6 quarters to complete the core course requirements are identical to those for the ph d program a student that transfers to the ph d program after the first academic year will be considered a second year ph d student doctor of philosophy the ph d degree in computational and mathematical engineering is a top ranked research oriented program usually completed in 4 6 years there are few course requirements and the focus is on preparation for a career in cme research the program requires a minimum of 135 units of residency at stanford including 45 units from the ms program ph d minor in computational engineering for a minor in computational and mathematical engineering cme a doctoral candidate must complete 20 unduplicated units in the program these should include three icme core courses and three icme graduate electives at the 300 level or above a maximum of two units can be taken as icme seminar units all courses except the seminar courses must be taken for a letter grade and passed with a grade of b or better minor programs must receive approval from the icme student services prior to completing any of the icme graduate electives minor programs should be developed in close discussion between the student and their primary ph d adviser mathematical and computational science the institute also participates in the interdepartmental undergraduate program designed as a major for students interested in the mathematical sciences or in the use of mathematical ideas and analysis of problems in the social or management sciences 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved icme home about icme people faculty staff students master of science directory doctor of philosophy directory gallery alumni ms alumni directory ph d alumni directory keeping in touch advisors prospective students admissions requirements deadlines application financing academics academic programs master of science doctor of philosophy mathematical and computational science courses current undergraduate service graduate service graduate core classx consulting c2 research research profiles theses icme theses sccm theses seminars list of seminars resources computer resources icme life history interactive timeline faculty pioneers in science computing george forsythe gene golub joe oliger sccm ms and phd programs sccm alumni lectures on the history of numerical analysis conferences mmds 06 08 gene golub's legacy 03 08 remembering gene golub 02 08 stanford50 05 07 mmds 06 06 svg 01 04 contact us
