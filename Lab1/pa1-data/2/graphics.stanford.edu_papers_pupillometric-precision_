the pupillometric precision of a remote video eye tracker the pupillometric precision of a remote video eye tracker jeff klingner stanford university proceedings of the 2010 symposium on eye tracking research & applications abstract to determine the accuracy and precision of pupil measurements made with the tobii 1750 remote video eye tracker we performed a formal metrological study with respect to a calibrated reference instrument a medical pupillometer we found that the eye tracker measures mean binocular pupil diameter with precision 0.10 mm and mean binocular pupil dilations with precision 0.15 mm figure 1 the eye tracker tobii 1750 and reference pupillometer neuroptics vip 200 figure 3 differences between the eye tracker and pupillometer measurements broken down by study participant and eye showing how the eye tracker's pupillometric bias varies for each eye data from each participant and each subject are plotted in a different color paper pdf 3.6 mb bibtex inproceedings klingner_pupillometric_precision_2010 author klingner jeff title the pupillometric precision of a remote video eye tracker booktitle etra 10 proceedings of the 2010 symposium on eye tracking research & applications year 2010 isbn 978 1 60558 994 7 pages 259 262 location austin texas doi 10.1145 1743666.1743727 publisher acm address new york ny usa
