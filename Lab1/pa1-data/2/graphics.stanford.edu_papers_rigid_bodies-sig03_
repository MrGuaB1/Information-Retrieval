nonconvex rigid bodies with stacking nonconvex rigid bodies with stacking eran guendelman stanford university robert bridson stanford university ronald fedkiw stanford university siggraph 2003 abstract we consider the simulation of nonconvex rigid bodies focusing on interactions such as collision contact friction kinetic static rolling and spinning and stacking we advocate representing the geometry with both a triangulated surface and a signed distance function defined on a grid and this dual representation is shown to have many advantages we propose a novel approach to time integration merging it with the collision and contact processing algorithms in a fashion that obviates the need for ad hoc threshold velocities and show that this approach matches the theoretical solution for blocks sliding and stopping on inclined planes with friction we also present a new shock propagation algorithm that allows for efficient use of the propagation as opposed to the simultaneous method for treating contact these new techniques are demonstrated on a variety of problems ranging from simple test cases to stacking problems with as many as 1000 nonconvex rigid bodies with friction as shown in figure 1 figure 1 1000 nonconvex rings with friction settling after being dropped onto a set of 25 poles each ring is made up of 320 triangles and each pole is made up of 880 triangles paper pdf hires 5mb lores 350kb siggraph slides ppt videos divx click here for more videos
