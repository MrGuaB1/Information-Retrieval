the openproof project at csli heterogeneous reasoning the openproof project at csli research a sample proof in hyperproof a proof begins with some initial information generally provided in the form of a diagram depicting a blocks world which we call a situation plus one or more sentences expressed in the language of first order logic this initial information is called the given information and the aim of a proof is to demonstrate that one or more characteristics hold of the given information for example we may want to show that a particular sentence follows logically from the given information or that we cannot determine the size or shape of a particular block on the basis of the given information below we show a sample proof this proof demonstrates that the sentence sameshape c d c is the same shape as d is a consequence of the given information here the given information consists of the situation displayed plus two sentences notice that this proof has several steps containing a diamond icon these are steps in which the user has made modifications to the situation in the course of the proof for example in the user's first step shown in the following image the label c has been applied to the small dodecahedron based on the information provided by the second given sentence we won t try to explain the various rules used in this proof suffice it to say that the proof goes on to show that the block named d must be one or the other of the two dodecahedra and hence that whichever it is c and d have the same shape 1 2 3 4 next the openproof project csli stanford university csli publications all pages and images on this web site are copyright material the openproof project 2005 2012 version equinox11
