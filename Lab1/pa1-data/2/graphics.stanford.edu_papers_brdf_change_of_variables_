a new change of variables for efficient brdf representation a new change of variables for efficient brdf representation szymon rusinkiewicz presented at the 1998 eurographics workshop on rendering abstract we describe an idea for making decomposition of bidirectional reflectance distribution functions into basis functions more efficient by performing a change of variables transformation on the brdfs in particular we propose a reparameterization of the brdf as a function of the halfangle ie the angle halfway between the directions of incidence and reflection and a difference angle instead of the usual parameterization in terms of angles of incidence and reflection because features in common brdfs including specular and retroreflective peaks are aligned with the transformed coordinate axes the change of basis reduces storage requirements for a large class of brdfs we present results derived from analytic brdfs and measured data full paper pdf
