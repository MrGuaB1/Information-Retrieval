3d transformations 3d transformations cs 248 introduction to computer graphics autumn quarter 2001 marc levoy lecture notes for tuesday october 30 and part of thursday november 1 table of contents homogeneous representation of 3d transformations inverses of 2d and 3d transformations transforming points lines planes transforming images linear transformation of images taxonomy of mappings i ll finish the taxonomy on thursday november 1 thus the 3d cartesian coordinates occupy the w 1 three dimensional subspace within 4d homogeneous space note that the function f transforms one 2d space to another 2d space no matter what kind of warp we want to apply to the image including perspective as we shall see we don t need a z coordinate we formalize this notion in the next section for one class of functions linear transformations in 2d we implement these transformations by converting 2d cartesian coordinates to 3d homogeneous coordinates which we multiply by a 3 x 3 matrix n 3 in the above taxonomy in other words linear mappings in 2d are those that can be accomplished using a 2 x 2 matrix multiplication with the coordinates not raised to any power as inputs for this reason the w 1 plane is sometimes called the 2d affine space associated with the 3d homogeneous coordinate space note also that this perspective foreshortening required a division by w to accomplish the columns of this chart are assumed to be in the same space in particular if we are talking about rigid affine and projective transformations in r n 1 with respect to the taxonomy then the linear column also refers to linear transformations in r n 1 not in r n levoy cs stanford edu copyright 2001 marc levoy last update october 30 2001 09 04 01 pm
