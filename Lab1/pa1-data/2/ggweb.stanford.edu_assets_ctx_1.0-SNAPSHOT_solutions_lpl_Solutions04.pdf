chapter 4 hints and selected solutions page 1 chapter 4 hints and selected solutions section 4.1 page 104 4.2 1 the truth table for a b a b is shown in figure since all the entries under the main connective are t it shows that the sentence is a tautology 4.5 the truth table is shown below since not all the entries under the main connective are t the sentence is not a tautology however some of the entries in this column are t so the sentence is tt possible 1 page 2 4.9 make sure you understand why there could not be a yes in the first column and a no in the second if you do not understand this be sure to look it up in the book or ask your instructor it is a simple but key point here are a few of the answers for this problem so you can see if you have the right idea sentence tw possible tt possible 1 yes yes 4 no yes 7 no yes 10 yes yes section 4.2 page 109 4.12 the truth table is shown below since the truth values under the main connectives of each sentence are the same row by row it shows that the sentences are tautologically equivalent 2 page 3 section 4.3 page 113 4.21 the truth table is shown below we have abbreviated the sentences in order to make the picture fit on the page you should not abbreviate yours or gg will complain since there is a row the first where the first two sentences are both true and the third is false it shows that the third is not a tautological consequence of the first two section 4.4 page 116 3 page 4 4.26 the complete proofs of taut con 1 and taut con 2 are shown below section 4.5 page 120 4.31 2 cube a larger b a 4 cube a larger b a 6 cube a larger b a a b 8 tet b large c smaller d e 10 dodec f tet b tet f dodec f this sentence is logically equivalent to dodec f so that would be a good answer too 4 page 5 4.33 a b a a b a associativity of a a b commutivity of a a b associativity of a b idempotence of 5
