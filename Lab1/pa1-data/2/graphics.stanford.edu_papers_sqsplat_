streaming qsplat a viewer for networked visualization of large dense models streaming qsplat a viewer for networked visualization of large dense models szymon rusinkiewicz marc levoy presented at i3d 2001 1 second 10 seconds 60 seconds view dependent streaming data transmission of a 130 million sample model over a network limited to 384 kbps the model is a portion of michelangelo's unfinished statue of st matthew abstract steady growth in the speeds of network links and graphics accelerator cards has brought increasing interest in streaming transmission of three dimensional data sets we demonstrate how streaming visualization can be made practical for data sets containing hundreds of millions of samples our system is based on qsplat a multiresolution rendering system for dense polygon meshes that employs a bounding sphere hierarchy data structure and splat rendering we show how to incorporate view dependent progressive transmission into qsplat by having the client request visible portions of the model in order from coarse to fine resolution in addition we investigate interaction techniques for improving the effectiveness of streaming data visualization in particular we explore color coding streamed data by resolution examine the order in which data should be transmitted in order to minimize visual distraction and propose tools for giving the user fine control over download order full paper as pdf 6 pages 1 color plate 402685 bytes copyright 2001 acm the qsplat software page is here slides from the i3d 2001 talk are here smr cs stanford edu
