grayscale gamma dithering grayscale gamma dithering cs 248 introduction to computer graphics autumn quarter 2002 marc levoy lecture notes for tuesday october 8 second half of class table of contents gamma correction television chain graphics chain quantization for graphics so how many bits color quantization and dithering to be covered on thursday quantization without dithering quantization with dithering adaptive quantization iv so how many bits do we need per pixel synthetic images 6 8 bits some people claim they need more quantization in a linear perceived brightness space 5 bits looks acceptable at least for this example scanned painted images 5 bits usually ok why noise breaks up contouring artifacts antialiased edges 3 bits suffice why shorter distance so contours are compressed this example was also hand drawn which breaks up contours click here to see a demo of quantization levels make sure you view this demo on a gamma corrected monitor as the instructions say the rest of this lecture will be covered on thursday oct 11 levoy cs stanford edu copyright 2002 marc levoy last update october 7 2002 06 40 37 pm
