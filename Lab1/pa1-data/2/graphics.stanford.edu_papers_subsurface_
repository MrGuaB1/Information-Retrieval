reflection from layered surfaces due to subsurface scattering reflection from layered surfaces due to subsurface scattering pat hanrahan and wolfgang kreuger computer graphics proc siggraph 1993 july 1993 abstract the reflection of light from most materials consists of two major terms the specular and the diffuse specular reflection may be modeled from first principles by considering a rough surface consisting of perfect reflectors or micro facets diffuse reflection is generally considered to result from multiple scattering either from a rough surface or from within a layer near the surface accounting for diffuse reflection by lambert's cosine law as is universally done in computer graphics is not a physical theory based on first principles this paper presents a model for subsurface scattering in layered surfaces in terms of one dimensional linear transport theory we derive explicit formulas for backscattering and transmission that can be directly incorporated in most rendering systems and a general monte carlo method that is easily added to a ray tracer this model is particularly appropriate for common layered materials appearing in nature such as biological tissues eg skin leaves etc or inorganic materials eg snow sand paint varnished or dusty surfaces as an application of the model we simulate the appearance of a face and a cluster of leaves from experimental data describing their layer properties additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper without figures 590k plate 1 plate 2 plate 3 plate 4 plate 5 plate 6 back up to papers index
