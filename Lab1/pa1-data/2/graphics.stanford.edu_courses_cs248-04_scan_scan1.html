rasterization algorithms rasterization algorithms cs 248 introduction to computer graphics autumn quarter 2004 marc levoy lecture notes for thursday october 14 table of contents overview of 3d rendering pipeline line drawing assumptions brute force algorithm dda algorithm bresenham algorithm what do real workstations use polygon scan conversion assumptions algorithm which pixels to fill the algorithm that follows which is taken from section 3.6 in the textbook handles self intersecting eg bow tie or degenerate polygons naturally even polygons with holes as mentioned in handout 7 you will need to handle the first two types in project 2 but not the third by the way handling these cases by decomposing them into triangles is not allowed at least for the project note that step 3.2 remove edges should be performed before step 3.3 fill the scanline in the algorithm despite the physical order in which they appear in the list above previous versions of these notes and previous editions of the textbook had filling performed before removing edges that order was incorrect also the suggested code for updating the x coordinate in step 3.5 is an integer only solution lifted from bresenhham's algorithm if you re willing to use floating point arithmetic then the increment becomes just the floating point slope with no if test necessary in general a polygon rasterizer should fill only and all sample positions that fall inside polygon edges in previous versions of project 2 we also required students to rasterize their polygons such that they meshed perfectly ie with no holes or doubly drawn pixels to satisfy this requirement care must be taken when sample positions coincide with polygon edges or vertices as discussed above this year we do not require this thus you can ignore these rules at least for the project levoy cs stanford edu copyright 2004 marc levoy last update october 14 2004 08 44 34 pm
