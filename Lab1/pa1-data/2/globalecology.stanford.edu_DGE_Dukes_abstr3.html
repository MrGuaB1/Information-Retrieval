js dukes abstract 3 diverse mechanisms for co 2 effects on grassland litter decomposition dukes js field cb 2000 global change biology 6 2 145 154 the ongoing increase in atmospheric co2 concentration co2 can potentially alter litter decomposition rates by changing i the litter quality of individual species ii allocation patterns of individual species iii the species composition of ecosystems which could alter ecosystem level litter quality and allocation iv patterns of soil moisture and v the composition and size of microbial communities to determine the relative importance of these mechanisms in a california annual grassland we created four mixtures of litter that differed in species composition the annual legume lotus wrangelianus fischer & c meyer comprised either 10 or 40 of the initial mass and atmospheric co2 during growth ambient or double ambient these mixtures decomposed for 33 weeks at three positions above on and below the soil surface in four types of grassland microcosms fertilized and unfertilized microcosms exposed to elevated or ambient co2 and at a common field site initially legume rich litter mixtures had higher nitrogen concentrations n than legume poor mixtures in most positions and environments the different litter mixtures decomposed at approximately the same rate fertilization and co2 enrichment of microcosms had no effect on mass loss of litter within them however mass loss was strongly related to litter position in both microcosms and the field nitrogen dynamics of litter were significantly related to the initial n of litter on the soil surface but not in other positions we conclude that changes in allocation patterns and species composition are likely to be the dominant mechanisms through which ecosystem level decomposition rates respond to increasing atmospheric co2
