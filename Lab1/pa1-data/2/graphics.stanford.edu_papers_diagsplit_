diagsplit parallel crack free adaptive tessellation for micropolygon rendering diagsplit parallel crack free adaptive tessellation for micropolygon rendering matthew fisher kayvon fatahalian solomon boulos kurt akeley william r mark pat hanrahan presented at siggraph asia 2009 abstract we present diagsplit a parallel algorithm for adaptively tessellating displaced parametric surfaces into high quality crack free micropolygon meshes diagsplit modifies the split dice tessellation algorithm to allow splits along non isoparametric directions in the surface's parametric domain and uses a dicing scheme that supports unique tessellation factors for each subpatch edge edge tessellation factors are computed using only information local to subpatch edges these modifications allow all subpatches generated by diagsplit to be processed independently without introducing t junctions or mesh cracks and without incurring the tessellation overhead of binary dicing we demonstrate that diagsplit produces output that is better in terms of image quality and number of micropolygons produced than existing parallel tessellation schemes and as good as highly adaptive split dice implementations that are less amenable to parallelization paper pdf 13 mb video quicktime high quality 61 mb video quicktime lower quality 17 mb posted 9 11 2009
