e coli plasmid vector pjls1021 incomplete lac promoter & cat gene pjls1021 vector ig sequence link general plasmid ds dna 99 bp functions cloning selection copy number hosts e coli suppliers misc comments to produce clone pjls1021 a bamhi site was inserted the distance between promoter and start codon was changed and the size of the possible stem loop structure was increased in clone pijs310 m10274 the region controlling translation of the cat gene has been varied structurally so that the gene is under control of the lac promoter altering the potential for secondary structure formation within the translation control region causes a ten fold variation in the synthesis of the cat enzyme whereas varying the distance between the ribosome binding site and the start codon from 7 to 13 bases does not significantly affect the yield of cat enzyme if the shine dalgarno sequence is situated in a region of mrna capable of base pairing the efficiency of translation is decreased the start codon can initiate translation efficiently even when located in a segment capable of duplex formation if translation is initiated upstream of the cat start codon then out of frame overlapping translation reduces cat production by 90 and in frame overlapping translation prevents detectable initiation of protein synthesis at the cat gene start codon and yields only fusion proteins ncbi gi 208713 parents pijs310 siblings descendents ncbi entrez link return to vector homepage
