hardware implementation of micropolygon rasterization with motion and defocus blur hardware implementation of micropolygon rasterization with motion and defocus blur john brunhaver kayvon fatahalian pat hanrahan in the proceedings of high performance graphics 2010 abstract current gpus rasterize micropolygons polygons approximately one pixel in size inefficiently additionally they do not natively support triangle rasterization with jittered sampling defocus or motion blur we perform a microarchitectural study of fixed function micropolygon rasterization using custom circuits we present three rasterization designs the first optimized for triangle micropolygons that are not blurred a second for stochastic rasterization of micropolygons with motion and defocus blur and third that is a hybrid combination of the two our designs achieve high area and power efficiency by using low precision operations and rasterizing pairs of adjacent triangles in parallel we demonstrate optimized designs synthesized in a 45 nm process showing that a micropolygon rasterization unit with a throughput of 3 billion micropolygons per second would consume 2.9 w and occupy 4.1 mm 2 which is 0.77 of the die area of a geforce gtx 480 gpu paper pdf 172 kb posted 05 16 2010
