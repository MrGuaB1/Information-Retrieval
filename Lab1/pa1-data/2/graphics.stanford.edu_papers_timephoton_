time dependent photon mapping time dependent photon mapping mike cammarano henrik wann jensen computer science department stanford university to appear in eurographics workshop on rendering 02 abstract the photon map technique for global illumination does not specifically address animated scenes in particular prior work has not considered the problem of temporal sampling motion blur while using the photon map in this paper we examine several approaches for simulating motion blur with the photon map in particular we show that a distribution of photons in time combined with the standard photon map radiance estimate is incorrect and we introduce a simple generalization that correctly handles photons distributed in both time and space our results demonstrate that this time dependent photon map extension allows fast and correct estimates of motion blurred illumination including motion blurred caustics pdf 1.16 mb this page created by mike cammarano wed 29 may 2002 last modified tue 4 jun 2002
