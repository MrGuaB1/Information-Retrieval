a multiscale method to large scale inverse modeling presenting author jianlin fu stanford university abstract high resolutio page 1 a multiscale method to large scale inverse modeling presenting author jianlin fu stanford university abstract high resolution geologic models that incorporate observed state data are expected to effectively enhance the reliability of performance prediction one of the major challenges is how to solve the large scale inverse modeling problem ie to infer high resolution models from the given observed state that are related to the model parameters according to the known physical rules eg the flow and transport partial differential equations there are basically two problems one is high dimensional problem and the other is inverse problem a multiscale method is presented in this work to attack these problems with the aid of a gradient based optimization algorithm within this method the model responses ie the simulated state data are very efficiently computed from the high resolution model using the multiscale finite volume method the mismatch between the observations and the simulations is then defined as the objective function and the fine scale sensitivity coefficient ie the derivative of the objective function with respect to each node's attribute is computed by the multiscale adjoint method for the subsequent optimization the difficult high dimensional optimization problem is reduced to a one dimension using the gradient based gradual deformation method the method presented is not only computationally efficient but also generates geologically consistent models
