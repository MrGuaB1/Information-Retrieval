transfer efficiency and depth invariance in computational cameras iccp 2010 transfer efficiency and depth invariance in computational cameras jongmin baek proc ieee international conference on computational photography march 2010 figure top the transfer efficiency of the given lenses bottom the depth variance of the given lenses abstract recent advances in computational cameras achieve extension of depth of field by modulating the aperture of an imaging system either spatially or temporally they are however accompanied by loss of image detail the chief cause of which is low and or depth varying frequency response of such systems in this paper we examine the tradeoff between achieving depth invariance and maintaining high transfer efficiency by providing a mathematical framework for analyzing the transfer function of these computational cameras using this framework we prove mathematical bounds on the efficacy of the tradeoff these bounds lead to observations on the fundamental limitations of computational cameras in particular we show that some existing designs are already near optimal in our metrics paper pdf 473 kb link supplement pdf 127 kb fast computation of the otfs for various computational cameras link slides pdf 3.9 mb link
