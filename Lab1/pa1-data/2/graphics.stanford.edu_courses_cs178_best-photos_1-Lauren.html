assignment 1 bad photos assignment 1 bad photos lauren lauren gimmillaro bad break i took this picture in our dorm's game room at the beginning of a billiards game the perfect triangle of pool balls broke apart and dispersed when the cue ball made contact at the top of the image a white streak appears showing the cue ball approaching the stack while all of the other blurs are the balls moving apart after the contact the color of the ball matches that of the streak showing its movement in order to take this picture i had to use a 2 second shutter speed with a small aperture as to not let too much light in i also turned off the lights in the room to make it darker otherwise the image would have been over exposed because the shutter speed was so slow i used a tripod to make the movement causing the blur from the balls and not my hands previous back to all photos next
