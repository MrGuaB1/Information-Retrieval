fast volume segmentation fast volume segmentation with simultaneous visualization using programmable graphics hardware anthony sherbondy stanford university mike houston stanford university sandy napel stanford university to appear in ieee visualization 2003 abstract segmentation of structures from measured volume data such as anatomy in medical imaging is a challenging data dependent task in this paper we present a segmentation method that leverages the parallel processing capabilities of modern programmable graphics hardware in order to run significantly faster than previous methods in addition collocating the algorithm computation with the visualization on the graphics hardware circumvents the need to transfer data across the system bus allowing for faster visualization and interaction this algorithm is unique in that it utilizes sophisticated graphics hardware functionality ie floating point precision render to texture computational masking and fragment programs to enable fast segmentation and interactive visualization a b c d these four volume renderings utilize a fully opaque transfer function but are segmented using the method discussed in this paper the segmented volumes show a abdominal aortic branch vessels b an aortic aneurysm c an aorta and d peripheral blood vessels in the lung the yellow arrows indicate the location of the user's initial seeds that were evolved to form the presented segmentations paper adobe acrobat pdf 2.08 mb
