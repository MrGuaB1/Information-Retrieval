assignment 8 portraiture and light assignment 8 portraiture and light jonah jonah brown cohen that's why they call it window pane this photo was taken next to a window with a screen over it the key light is from the sun coming through the window i liked how the screen created a sort of diffraction pattern on her face the fill light was ambient light from the room coming from an adjacent set of windows i used a focal length of 50mm to zoom in on her face and an aperture of f 5.6 to bring the focus onto the foreground this photo was initially fairly washed out and part of the window screen was a little over exposed i used a curve layer in photoshop to bring down the exposure of the brightest parts and increased the overall exposure of the shot previous back to all photos next
