assignment 3 macro photography assignment 3 macro photography kseniya kseniya charova i shot this on a partially cloudy morning behind the cactus garden i liked how i could see the anatomy of the flower and focused on the part where the white strands connect to the center i set my exposure time to 1 640 because the flower was moving in the wind and i wanted to get a crisp image despite how close my lens was to the object my aperture was at f 9 and i was very close to the object so the shallow depth of field created a very nice smooth green background for the flower i like how the strands of white lead the eye to the center of the flower previous back to all photos next
