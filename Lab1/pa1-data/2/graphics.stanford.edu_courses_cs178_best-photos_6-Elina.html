assignment 6 landscape and nature assignment 6 landscape and nature elina elina robeva the s curve in the photo is the windy road that one can barely see behind the fence i took this photo near the 280 highway at one of the vista point stops i wanted to use the no trespassing sign somehow so i made the scenery beyond it black and white so that it tells the viewer that the area is not reachable it seems as if whoever is on this side of the sign is blocked from civilization represented by the highway and the cars on it previous back to all photos next
