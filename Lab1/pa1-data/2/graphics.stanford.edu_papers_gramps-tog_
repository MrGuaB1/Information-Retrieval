gramps a programming model for graphics pipelines gramps a programming model for graphics pipelines jeremy sugerman kayvon fatahalian solomon boulos kurt akeley pat hanrahan in acm transactions on graphics january 2009 abstract we introduce gramps a programming model that generalizes concepts from modern real time graphics pipelines by exposing a model of execution containing both fixed function and application programmable processing stages that exchange data via queues gramps allows the number type and connectivity of these processing stages to be defined by software permitting arbitrary processing pipelines or even processing graphs applications achieve high performance using gramps by expressing advanced rendering algorithms as custom pipelines then using the pipeline as a rendering engine we describe the design of gramps then evaluate it by implementing three pipelines direct3d a ray tracer and a hybridization of the two and running them on emulations of two different gramps implementations a traditional gpu like architecture and a cpu like multi core architecture in our tests our gramps schedulers run our pipelines with 500 to 1500 kb of queue usage at their peaks paper adobe acrobat pdf 3.0 mb posted 10 3 2008
