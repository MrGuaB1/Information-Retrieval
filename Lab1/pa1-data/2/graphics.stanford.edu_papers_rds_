efficient partitioning of fragment shaders for multipass rendering on programmable graphics hardware efficient partitioning of fragment shaders for multipass rendering on programmable graphics hardware eric chan ren ng pradeep sen kekoa proudfoot and pat hanrahan computer science department stanford university proceedings of the siggraph eurographics workshop on graphics hardware 2002 abstract real time programmable graphics hardware has resource constraints that prevent complex shaders from rendering in a single pass one way to virtualize these resources is to partition shading computations into multiple passes each of which satisfies the given constraints many such partitions exist for a shader but it is important to find one that renders efficiently we present recursive dominator split rds a polynomial time algorithm that uses a cost model to find near optimal partitions of arbitrarily complex shaders using a simulator we analyze partitions for architectures with different resource constraints and show that rds performs well on different graphics architectures we also demonstrate that shader partitions computed by rds can run efficiently on programmable graphics hardware available today paper adobe acrobat pdf 263 kb video quicktime 49.5 mb avi 23.5 mb talk slides eric chan
