prototyping theory research stanford hci group courses people connect directions understanding how prototyping practices affect design results project abstract how do prototyping practices affect learning motivation communication and outcome in design this research examines aspects of the creative process such iteration and comparison two key strategies for discovering contextual design variables and their interrelationships we found that even under tight time constraints when the common intuition is to stop iterating and start refining iterative prototyping helps designers learn our experiments also indicate that creating and receiving feedback on multiple prototypes in parallel as opposed to serially leads to more divergent ideation more explicit comparison less investment in a single concept and better overall design performance most recently we found that groups who produce and share multiple prototypes report a greater increase in rapport exchange more verbal information share more features and overall reach a better consensus what's our approach we recruit people to participate in tasks where the solutions are creatively diverse and objectively measurable we ve had success using the egg drop design task where participants create a vessel to protect a raw egg most recently our studies call on participants to create web banner ads we then place the ads in an online campaign collect a host of analytics eg click through data and statistically compare performance differences the key insight enabling our research is that crowdsourcing techniques and web analytics provide an opportunity to do experimental research on creativity with objective outcomes publications prototyping dynamics sharing multiple designs improves exploration group rapport and results steven p dow julie fortuna dan schwartz beth altringer daniel l schwartz and scott r klemmer acm conference on human factors in computing systems 2011 parallel prototyping leads to better design results more divergence and increased self efficacy steven p dow alana glassco jonathan kass melissa schwarz daniel l schwartz scott r klemmer in acm transactions on computer human interaction 17 4 2010 the efficacy of prototyping under time constraints steven p dow kate heddleston and scott r klemmer acm sigchi conf on creativity and cognition 2009 people steven dow spdow at stanford edu scott klemmer srk at stanford edu dan schwartz danls at stanford edu
