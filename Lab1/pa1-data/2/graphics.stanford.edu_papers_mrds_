efficient partitioning of fragment shaders for multiple output hardware efficient partitioning of fragment shaders for multiple output hardware tim foley stanford university mike houston stanford university pat hanrahan stanford university to appear at graphics hardware 2004 abstract partitioning fragment shaders into multiple rendering passes is an effective technique for virtualizing shading resource limits in graphics hardware the recursive dominator split rds algorithm is a polynomial time algorithm for partitioning fragment shaders for real time rendering that has been shown to generate efficient partitions rds does not however work for shaders with multiple outputs and does not optimize for hardware with support for multiple render targets we present merging recursive dominator split mrds an extension of the rds algorithm to shaders with arbitrary numbers of outputs which can efficiently utilize hardware support for multiple render targets as well as a new cost metric for evaluating the quality of multipass partitions on modern consumer graphics hardware we demonstrate that partitions generated by our algorithm execute more efficiently than those generated by rds alone and that our cost model is effective in predicting the relative performance of multipass partitions paper adobe acrobat pdf 160 kb
