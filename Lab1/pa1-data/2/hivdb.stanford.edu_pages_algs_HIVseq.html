hiv drug resistance database stanford university hiv drug resistance database a curated public database designed to represent store and analyze the divergent forms of data underlying hiv drug resistance home genotype rx genotype pheno genotype clinical hiv db program hivseq program literature prevalence of mutations in submitted sequences hivseq accepts user submitted rt and protease sequences compares them to the consensus subtype b reference sequence and uses the differences as query parameters for interrogating the hiv drug resistance database this allows users to detect unusual sequence results immediately so that the person doing the sequencing can check the primary sequence output while it is still on the desktop in addition unexpected associations between sequences or isolates can be discovered by immediately retrieving data on isolates sharing one or more mutations with the sequence on july 27 the program was updated to provide subtype specific mutation prevalence for subtypes a ae ag c d f and g in addition to subtype b the ability to extend the program was made possible by a multicenter collaborative effort of the non b hiv drug resistance working group the mutation prevalence data underlying hivseq can be queried directly using the mutation prevalence according to subtype and treatment form a detailed description of the program as well as all updates can be found in the release notes choose a method analysis mutation list enter protease and rt mutations analysis sequences enter complete sequences database citing database terms of use faqs user guide & database documents database statistics news resources hiv treatment websites rt protease and integrase structures additional resources team who we are & how to contact us publications acknowledgements 1998 2012 all rights reserved questions contact hivdb
