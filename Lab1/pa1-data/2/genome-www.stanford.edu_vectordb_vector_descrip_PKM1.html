e coli plasmid vector pkm1 complete pkm1 vector ig sequence link general plasmid ds dna 4378 bp functions promoter analysis selection copy number hosts e coli n100 e coli suppliers atcc misc comments assembled from pko1 and phage lambda by f pfeiffer this is a promoter probe vector the promoterless galk gene is used as selectable marker translationsal stop codons in all reading frames are present on a 11 bp oligonucleotide before the galkgene also a polylinker was cloned before this gene in addition the lambda tr1 transcription terminator was inserted before the galk gene to allow measurement of very strong promoters due to read through transcription promoter cloning vector for isolating and characterizing very strong promoters 1 this vector was constructed by inserting a rho dependent terminator lambdatri into the smai site of pko1 atcc 37126 this reduces the number of transcripts reaching the galk coding sequences to 30 or less & is thus useful for strong promoters 2 medium is 1227 lb plus ampicillin parents ecogalk pbr322 pko 1 lambda siblings descendents pkm2 ncbi entrez link return to vector homepage
