roadmap to the vrippack directory tree roadmap to the vrippack directory tree below is a description of the directory structure of the vrippack distribution include when you unpack vrippack this contains one include file mostly macros but a bunch of other include files get created as symbolic links during the first make lib this contains links to the essential libraries which live in the src directories after successful compilation bin this contains links to all the binaries that created after successful compilation be sure to include this in your path src the source tree src linear vector and matrix classes and routines used by a number of the other tools src libply ply polygon mesh format library src plytools a suite of useful tools for manipulating ply files click here for a summary of what each program does generated by plyusages csh src softrender code for resampling range images into floating point depth maps essentially z buffers that can be used by vrip for efficient processing this code is practically unintelligble src vrip the core software that reads in range images and merges them into a run length encoded volume click here for a roadmap to that code src march marching cubes code that extracts a triangle mesh from a run length encoded volume src plyclean code for cleaning up marching cubes meshes in short marching cubes can generate triangles with arbitrarily small edges and this code is used to collapse triangles with edges below a certain tolerance src pvrip tools for handling large datasets breaks the data and the volume into manageable blocks and optionally distributes the blocks among multiple processors on multiple machines this toolset is at the moment not documented
