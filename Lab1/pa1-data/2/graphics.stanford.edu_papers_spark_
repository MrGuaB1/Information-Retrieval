spark modular composable shaders for graphics hardware spark modular composable shaders for graphics hardware tim foley pat hanrahan proceedings of siggraph 2011 abstract in creating complex real time shaders programmers should be able to decompose code into independent localized modules of their choosing current real time shading languages however enforce a fixed decomposition into per pipeline stage procedures program concerns at other scales including those that cross cut multiple pipeline stages cannot be expressed as reusable modules we present a shading language spark and its implementation for modern graphics hardware that improves support for separation of concerns into modules a spark shader class can encapsulate code that maps to more than one pipeline stage and can be extended and composed using object oriented inheritance in our tests shaders written in spark achieve performance within 2 of hlsl paper pdf 3.1 mb posted 18th april 2011
