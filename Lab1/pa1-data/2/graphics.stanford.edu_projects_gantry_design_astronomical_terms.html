astronomical terms used to measure direction astronomical terms used to measure direction declination and right ascension in astronomy declination is the angular disance of a body north or south of the celestial equator declination and right ascension an east west coordinate together define the position of an object in the sky north declination is considered positive and south negative thus 90 degrees declination marks the north celestial pole near the north star and 90 degrees the south celestial pole altitude and azimuth in astronomy gunnery navigation and other fields altitude and azimuth are two coordinates describing the position of an object above the earth altitude in this sense is expressed as angular elevation up to 90 degrees above the horizon azimuth in astronomical measurement is the number of degrees clockwise from due south usually to the object's vertical circle ie a great circle through the object and the zenith for nonastronomical purposes azimuth or bearing is generally measured clockwise from due north zenith and nadir the zenith is the point on the celestial sphere directly above an observer on the earth the point 180 degrees opposite the zenith direclty underfoot is the nadir astronomical zenith is defined by gravity ie by sighting up a plumb line if the line were not deflected by such local irregularities in the earth's mass as mountains it would point to the geographic zenith because the earth rotates and is not a perfect sphere the geocentric zenith is slightly different from the geographic zenith except at the equator and the poles geocentric zenith is the intersection with the celestial sphere of a straight line drawn through the observer's position from the geometric center of the earth source encylopeadia britannica 15th edition 1986
