the nano center a quantum leap for cutting edge research thestanfordchallenge stanford edu page 1 winter 2008 the nano center a quantum leap for cutting edge research electrical engineer jelena vuckovic builds photonic crystals that may enable rapid fire lasers to accelerate internet traffic by orders of magnitude chemist and jg jackson and cj wood professor hongjie dai creates carbon nanotubes specialized molecules that may target cancer and detect biohazards though their expertise is in different fields their work is centered on one thing the nanoscale the study and manipulation of materials measured in billionths of a meter or nanometers is a rapidly expanding field that involves engineers biologists chemists physicists and others and because the properties of matter at this level are fundamentally different such efforts promise advances in every area of life from ultrafast communications to more effective medicines and cleaner fuels stanford's new center for nanoscale science and technology scheduled to begin construction next year will bring together hundreds of researchers like vuckovic and dai from departments all over campus the facility will house sophisticated research tools far too costly for single departments to maintain in state of the art laboratories that control for noise vibration and light jane and herb dwight 53 ms 59 among the first donors to the nano center were drawn to the project by a combination of technological savvy and historic personal connections to the university herb dwight was a cofounder of spectra physics whose products included the laser driven bar code scanners that ring up groceries he's deeply familiar with the kind of science and technology to be explored in the nano center and with stanford's record in the field since the birth of quantum electronics in the middle of the last century stanford has been a recognized leader in applied physics and photonics says dwight his most personal connection with the building however is decidedly low tech his great grandfather john duff mcgilvray led the stone masonry company that erected stanford's first sandstone buildings he regarded memorial church as one of his finest creations dwight recalls stanford has been an integral part of my family history and a source of many rich experiences in our lives over the years dwight has served in numerous capacities at stanford including on the university's board of trustees and his interests on campus are wide ranging along with their gift toward the nano center the dwights are lead donors to a task force at the hoover institution examining middle east ideologies fundamentalism and terrorism for his extraordinary involvement at stanford dwight will be awarded the gold spike in april 2008 the university's highest annual award for volunteer service when the nano center opens in fall 2009 it will be one of four buildings forming a new science and engineering quad stanford's largest building project since herb dwight's grandfather helped assemble the original campus on a recent tour of the site dwight inspected both exterior limestone and laboratory plans with the eyes of an engineer and a son of stanford it's hard to imagine anyone who could take a keener interest in how such a building is made or what will be made by the people who use it thestanfordchallenge stanford edu 2011 stanford university all rights reserved stanford benefactor is a publication of the office of development contact stanfordbenefactor stanford edu the center for nanoscale science and technology supported by a gift from jane and herb dwight 53 ms 59 below will be stanford's most advanced facility to date renderings courtesy of boora architects jane and herb dwight survey the site of stanford's future science and engineering quad photo steve castillo
