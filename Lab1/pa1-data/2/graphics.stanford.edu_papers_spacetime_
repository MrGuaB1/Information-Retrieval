better optical triangulation through spacetime analysis better optical triangulation through spacetime analysis brian curless and marc levoy proc iccv 95 abstract optical triangulation range scanners are finding wide usage in industrial inspection metrology medicine and computer graphics the standard methods for extracting range data from structured light reflecting off of an object are accurate only for planar surfaces of uniform reflectance illuminated by an incoherent source using these methods curved surfaces discontinuous surfaces and surfaces of varying reflectance cause systematic distortions of the range data coherent light sources such as lasers introduce speckle artifacts that further degrade the data we present a new ranging method based on analyzing the time evolution of the structured light reflections using our spacetime analysis we can correct for each of these artifacts thereby attaining significantly higher accuracy using existing technology we present results that demonstrate the validity of our method using a commercial laser stripe triangulation scanner additional information versions of the paper pdf version of the paper 271kb html version of the paper single file html version of the paper broken up by sections postscript version of full paper without grayscale figures 79k compressed 276kb uncompressed postscript version of full paper with grayscale figures 393k compressed 2.7 mb uncompressed postscript version of technical report with grayscale figures 415k compressed 2.8 mb uncompressed contains a few extra figures figures figure 8 from geometry to spacetime image to range data tiff 45kb figure 10 reflectance card tiff 39kb figure 12 depth discontinuities and edge curl tiff 70kb figure 13 shape ribbon tiff 55kb figure 14 model tractor jpeg 112kb demos renderings of a 2.4 million polygon model of a happy buddha constructed from range images using a volumetric method and this spacetime analysis last update 25 january 1995
