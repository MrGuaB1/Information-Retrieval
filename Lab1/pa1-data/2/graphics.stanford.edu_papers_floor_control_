floor control achieving effective floor control with a low bandwidth gesture sensitive videoconferencing system milton chen appears in proceedings of acm multimedia 2002 abstract multiparty videoconferencing with even a small number of people is often infeasible due to the high network bandwidth required bandwidth can be significantly reduced if most of the advantages of using full motion video can be achieved with low frame rate video unfortunately the impact of low frame rate video on communication is relatively unexplored we implemented a multiparty videoconferencing system that supports full motion video low frame rate video where the video is updated only once every few seconds and a hybrid scheme where full motion video is transmitted when the system detects that a user is making a gesture and low frame rate video is transmitted at all other times we studied people using our system for small group discussions and found that low frame rate video limited people's ability to request to speak or judge when to stop speaking the hybrid scheme conversely was as effective as full motion video for floor control resulting in a similar number of speaker changes while using only ten percent of the bandwidth paper adobe pdf format 460kb copyright notice from acm permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page copyrights for components of this work owned by others than acm must be honored abstracting with credit is permitted to copy otherwise to republish to post on servers or to redistribute to lists requires prior specific permission and or a fee miltchen graphics stanford edu
