analysis with geant4 and aida page 1 analysis with geant4 and aida tony johnson slac geant4 workshop february 2002 tony johnson page 2 what is aida aida abstract interfaces for data analysis aida user code eg geant 4 analysis tool 1 analysis tool 2 page 3 why aida goal provide the user with a powerful set of interfaces which can be used regardless of which underlying analysis tool they are using advantages the user will only need to learn one set of interfaces even if they use more than one tool by pooling the experiences of several different development teams we will be able to develop a more complete solution to the data analysis problem different analysis tools built using aida will be able to interoperate for example by exchanging objects in a common storage format initially xml currently two versions of the aida interfaces exist one for java one for c++ the two interfaces are as identical as the underlying languages will permit page 4 who is aida many people have contributed key players guy barrand lal mark donszelmann cern slac tony johnson slac andreas pfeiffer cern tools represented anaphne lhc++ lizard gaudi freehep jas open scientist colt wired page 5 what does aida currently support histograms 1d 2d and 3d filling data extraction arithmetic slices projections clouds unbinned histograms 1d 2d and 3d rebinnable histograms scatterplot unbinned fits n tuples with varying types of columns filling data extraction filters evaluators projections functions and fitting still needs work plotter display of histograms clouds functions regions overlays trees folders storage persistency aida database xml persistency aida files page 6 example aida program page 7 what aida compliant tools exist current version of aida is 2.2 1 tools c++ open scientist 8.0 http www lal in2p3 fr openscientist anaphne http anaphe web cern ch anaphe aida jni 1.0 http java freehep org lib freehep doc aida java jaida http java freehep org lib freehep doc aida xml aida dim for jas http jas freehep org jas tuple explorer http jas freehep org documentation tupleexplorer all tools do not yet support all features more contributors implementers welcome page 8 aida with geant4 aida allows geant4 examples to illustrate analysis techniques with choosing a single analysis tool the t01 tutorial has been set up to use aida for analysis by default links with a dummy implementation of aida switching to a real aida implementation is easy just set environment variables and relink source setup analysis or source setup analysis csh make bin g4system t01app novis mac page 9 simple gui build into jaida t01 also creates a t01 aida file which can be analyzed offline page 10 adding to t01 analysis t01analysismanager this class is a simple wrapper around the aida factories used to create histograms plotters and tuples you should not need to modify this class but you may want to take a look at it to understand what it is doing the useful methods it defines are static t01analysismanager getinstance get the singleton instance of t01analysismanager ihistogramfactory gethistogramfactory used for creating histograms ituplefactory gettuplefactory used for create tuples icloudfactory getcloudfactory used for creating clouds unbinned histograms iplotter createplotter create a plotter used for displaying histograms and clouds t01eventaction this is where the user defined analysis is performed after reading the aida users guide the code here should be fairly self explanatory a good exercise would be to add you own histograms and display them using the plotter or add your own columns to the tuple page 11 future gui analysis visualization currently visualization gui analysis are separate categories within geant4 this makes sense for g4 designers but perhaps not for users we hope to combine aida gag wired jas to form unified ui page 12 geant 4 menu used to start g4 executable currently available commands g4 output command arguments page 13 available histograms histos update in real time page 14 wired event display shows current event page 15 conclusions look at t01 source code t01analysismanager t01eventaction aida users guide on cd or at http aida freehep org lib doc usersguide ind ex shtml aida web site http aida freehep org
