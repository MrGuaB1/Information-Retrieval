william b gould iv diary of a contraband introduction william b gould's civil war diary chronicles his daily life in the united states navy from september 27 1862 to his discharge three years later on september 29 1865 one of the only known diaries of an african american sailor in the civil war this document describes his service and life as a sailor on the uss cambridge and later on the uss niagara which took him from the northeastern us to great britain holland belgium spain and portugal this site is intended to complement william b gould iv's book about his great grandfather diary of a contraband the civil war passage of a black sailor here the reader can view the diary itself and see aspects of it that cannot be replicated in a typescript or book the reader can also view a photo gallery of images related to the diary william b gould and his family the diary consists of two books plus some forty unbound pages that appear to have once been part of another book all of the extant material is provided here in chronological order there are only two significant hiatuses one for the period may october 1863 when he is hospitalized with the measles and the other for the late september 1864 early february 1865 period which appears to be a section that was somehow lost although wbg kept his entries chronologically on a day to day basis the order that some of the sections of the diary appear in the original books can be somewhat confusing wbg's first entries from sept 27 1862 to may 3 1863 are written in the final pages of the first book with the may 3 entry falling on the last page of the book at this point wbg becomes ill with the measles and presumably stops keeping daily entries the diary resumes on oct 13 1863 the day he is transferred from the chelsea naval hospital to the receiving ship ohio and then to the uss niagara on this day wbg begins a second book which runs uninterrupted from oct 13 1863 through sept 4 1864 opposite the sept 4 1864 entry on the last page of the book is wbg's drawing of the css stonewall the next surviving entry is an apparent continuation of a february 4 1865 entry the first part of the feb 4 entry as well as the preceding entries from sept 4 1864 onward have been lost the partial entry begins the first of about forty loose pages that were probably once part another book whose binding was destroyed as is clear from the scans provided here these pages are in the most fragile condition and have deteriorated significantly around the edges so that some of the text has been lost the last of these unbound pages contains wbg's may 26 1865 entry at this point wbg returns to the first book the book whose last 50 odd pages contain the beginning of his service from sept 27 1862 may 3 1863 he writes his may 27 1865 on the first page of the book and continues through sept 29 1865 the date of his discharge from the navy at the charlestown naval shipyard thus the 45 or so pages at the beginning of the first book contain the entries for the very end of his service while the last 50 or so pages contain his entries for the very beginning of his service to complicate matters further between the two sections at the beginning and the end of the first book are a large number of blank pages and a few pages of notes immediately following last diary entry on sept 29 1865 are two pages of trade notes detailing formulas for mixing different types of cement clay etc which were undoubtedly written after the war in the middle of the book surrounded on both sides by a number of blank pages are a two undated entries notes by wbg and the negro his friends and foes these items are written from the bottom line of the diary to the top or upside down although their placement in the diary makes dating them difficult they may well have been written by wbg before the war gallery selected images of william b gould's diary william b gould's early life in wilmington north carolina william b gould's life in the navy war memorabilia belonging to wbg and his sons william b gould's published articles william b gould's life after the war william b gould's descendents
