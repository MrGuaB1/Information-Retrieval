fast pairwise mutual information fast calculation of pairwise mutual information based on kernel estimation we present a new software implementation for more efficiently computing the mutual information for all pairs of genes from gene expression microarrays computation of the mutual information is a necessary first step in various information theoretic approaches for reconstructing gene regulatory networks from microarray data when the mutual information is estimated by kernel methods computing the pairwise mutual information is quite time consuming our implementation significantly reduces the computation time the essential idea is simple in practice when we encounter computational structures such as nested for loops double summations and double integrals switching the order of the procedures may sometimes result in significant gain our fast implementation utilizes this idea to reduce the repeated operations for an example data set of 9563 genes and 336 samples the current available software for aracne requires 142 hours to compute the mutual information between all possible pairs of genes whereas our implementation requires 1.6 hours matlab code for our fast implementation fastpairmi m the matlab code uses matrix operations which may not be available in other programming languages environments if you want to translate it into other languages it will be easier to follow this file fastpairmi_pseudo_code_version m which exactly matches the pseudo code provided in the manuscript for the purpose of comparison the implementation of aracne can be found at http amdec bioinfo cu genome org html aracne htm a manuscript of this work was published in computer methods and programs in biomedicine please follow this link if you have any questions or find any problems in it please email me at pqiu mdanderson org last update 02 02 2011 tumblr hit counter
