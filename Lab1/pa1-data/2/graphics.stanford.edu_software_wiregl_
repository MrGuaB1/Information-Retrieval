home wiregl software for opengl tiled rendering overview wiregl is an active research project at the stanford university computer graphics lab to explore cluster rendering systems the software package available on this web site allows graphics applications to render to a cluster of workstations outputting to a tiled display notice further development of wiregl has been rolled into the chromium project please visit the chromium web site for more information features implemented as an opengl driver allowing unmodified applications to render to cluster environment support for tcp ip and myrinet gm protocols geometry bucketing which only sends geometry to servers which need to render primitives support for up to 32 rendering nodes compiles under windows linux irix aix ia64 version 1.2 1 now available new features include support for multiple clients software image recombination parallel api windows service support this work is done under the multi graphics research project at stanford computer graphics lab this research is funded by the department of energy research the research page contains a list of the people who are involved in the wiregl project and the papers published downloads the download page provides links to the binary and source to the wiregl project contact the contact page lists email addresses for getting in touch with the wiregl team documentation the documentation page lists directions on how to the wiregl system works how to install the software compile the source and troubleshooting
