saccharomyces e coli plasmid vector ycp50 complete ycp50 vector ig sequence link general plasmid ds dna 7950 bp functions cloning shuttle selection copy number hosts e coli hb101 saccharomyces cerevisiae e coli suppliers atcc misc comments ycp50 was constructed by removing the ecori site in ycp19 between ars1 and cen4 and cloning the pvuii hindiii fragment into the pvuii site of yip5 the pvuii site was not regenerated 2 yc type shuttle vector the order of the major features in this plasmid is hindiii bamhi sphi ura3 cen4 ars1 pmb1 ori bla medium is 1227 lb plus ampicillin to pbr322 insert 1.1 kb hindiii hindiii ura3 fragment into avai site with no overhangs and 10 g's added to nt 1428 1437 and 10 c's added to nt 2601 2610 dg dc tailing to make yip5 ligate cen4 from pvuii to ecori to ars1 from ecor1 to hind iii delete 190 nt around ecori site 85 nt from each side bali site is deleted perhaps it is intact in 2 insert cen4 ars1 fragment pvuii cen4 dead ecori ars1 hindiii klenowed into pvuii site of yip5 change cagctg to caggtg so pvuii site is not regenerated and restriction site numbering of 2 is retained ncbi gi 406851 parents pbr322 yip5 siblings descendents ncbi entrez link return to vector homepage
