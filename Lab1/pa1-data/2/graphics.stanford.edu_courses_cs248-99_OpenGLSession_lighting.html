cs248 opengl introduction lighting basics lighting basics you can think of lighting as a way of automatically computing per vertex colors based on how geometry would look under a certain light source pays attention to the normals to the surface this means that to get smooth shading you must give a different normal for each vertex shading normals need not be true geometric normals they are often an average of the normals of adjacent triangles opengl lighting is local it considers only direct illumination not shadowing or interreflection of light to do lighting set up a light source set up materials specify geometry with normals
