a signal processing framework for reflection a signal processing framework for reflection ravi ramamoorthi and pat hanrahan submitted to the acm transactions on graphics august 2002 abstract we present a signal processing framework for analyzing the reflected light field from a homogeneous convex curved surface under distant illumination this analysis is of theoretical interest in both graphics and vision and is also of practical importance in many computer graphics problems for instance in determining lighting distributions and bidirectional reflectance distribution functions brdfs in rendering with environment maps and in image based rendering it is well known that under our assumptions the reflection operator behaves qualitatively like a convolution in this first part of the paper we formalize these notions showing that the reflected light field can be thought of in a precise quantitative way as obtained by convolving the lighting and brdf ie by filtering the incident illumination using the brdf mathematically we are able to express the frequency space coefficients of the reflected light field as a product of the spherical harmonic coefficients of the illumination and the brdf these results are of practical importance in determining the well posedness and conditioning of problems in inverse rendering estimation of brdf and lighting parameters from real photographs our mathematical analysis also has implications for forward rendering especially the efficient rendering of objects under complex lighting conditions specified by environment maps part 1 reflection as convolution pdf or gzipped ps part 2 analytic formulae for common lighting and brdf models pdf or gzipped ps ravi ramamoorthi last modified sat aug 10 23 55 58 pdt 2002
