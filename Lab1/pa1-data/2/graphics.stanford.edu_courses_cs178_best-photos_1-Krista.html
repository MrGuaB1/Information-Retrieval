assignment 1 bad photos assignment 1 bad photos krista krista doersch sea fan this is a metal candle holder inspired by sea fans the detail and reflectiveness really brought out the contrast and complexity of a two tone photo i set up the candle holder in front of a dark box i had in my room and turned all the lights off except for a small led fake candle in the holder which is why the light is so white i used the smallest aperture possible so that some of the photo would be out of focus i didn t make any adjustments after it was taken previous back to all photos next
