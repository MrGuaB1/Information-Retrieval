brookgpu getting started brookgpu getting started home introduction forums getting started language architecture brcc brt brt c++ current issues research sponsors hardware prerequisites the directx 9 backend requires a recent video card ati 9700 r300 and above and nvidia 5200 nv3x and above should work more recent boards supporting pixel shader 3.0 or better will be able to use looping and branching in kernels and offer the best performance the most important requirement is support for floating point render targets compiling for this backend requires the directx sdk to be installed this is the most stable and tested backend currently the opengl backend is supported on linux and windows but it uses the older pbuffer interface instead of fbo pbo nvidia boards are currenly better supported and will use nvidia specific assembly fp30 fp40 when possible ati boards are currenlty limited to arb_fragment_program assembly and like fp30 will not allow looping and branching in kernels that can t be statically unrolled the cpu backend should run on any platform even non pc where the build environment works the cpu backend is not as thoroughly tested as the above runtimes the ctm backend is new and is in an alpha state and currently only fully supported under windows to use it you will require the ctm and amucomp sdks from amd and you need to have built the amu libraries supplied as samples in the sdks software prerequisites the compiler and cpu runtime should build on any host with the standard gnu toolchain make g++ & gcc flex bison bin utils alternatively running with the gpu runtimes requires the following microsoft visual c++ version 7 or 8 preferably 8 cl exe must be executable at the command line microsoft directx 9 sdk http msdn microsoft com library default asp url downloads list directx asp nvidia's cg compiler at least version 1.1 and 1.5 is known to have compilation issues with brook http developer nvidia com object cg_toolkit html up to date ati or nvidia video drivers the following gnu tools from cygwin http www cygwin com make flex bison brcc will look for cgc and fxc the hlsl compiler from the directx 9 sdk in the path following the default installations cgc exe is in c program files nvidia corporation cg bin and fxc exe is in c dx90sdk utilities additionally compiling the directx runtime requires your include and lib paths include the directx 9 directories with the default installations these are c dx90sdk include and c dx90sdk lib compiling brook gpu everything including all the test programs and sample applications can be built by typing make at the top level you can run make from within any subdirectory to build just that directory building and running brook programs there are some toy programs used for testing the compiler and runtime in prog tests and more interesting programs in prog apps that can be used as examples basically brcc converts br files into cpp files which are then compiled and linked against the runtime brook lib at runtime brook lib selects the backend based on the environment variable brt_runtime the cpu backend is chosen by default and the values dx9 ogl and ctm select their respective backends sourceforge net logo the fly fishing flies featured on this web site can be purchased at the english fly fishing shop
