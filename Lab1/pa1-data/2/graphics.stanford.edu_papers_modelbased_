model based motion estimation for synthetic images model based motion estimation for synthetic images maneesh agrawala andrew c beers and navin chaddha accepted to acm multimedia 95 abstract one approach to performing motion estimation on synthetic animations is to treat them as video sequences and use standard image based motion estimation methods alternatively we can take advantage of information used in rendering the animation to guide the motion estimation algorithm this information includes the 3d movements of the objects in the scene and the projection transformations from 3d world space into screen space in this paper we examine how to use this high level object motion information to perform fast accurate block based motion estimation for synthetic animations the optical flow field is a 2d vector field describing the translational motion of each pixel from frame to frame our motion estimation algorithm first computes the optical flow field based on the object motion information we then combine the per pixel motion information for a block of pixels to create a single 2d projective matrix that best encodes the motion of all the pixels in the block the entries of the 2d matrix are determined using a least squares formulation our algorithms are more accurate and much faster in algorithmic complexity than most image based motion estimation algorithms other information available postscript version of paper tiff of figure 1 tiff of figure 2 tiff of figure 3 tiff of figure 11 mpeg movies of animation sequences used as examples these movies are made with standard mpeg using a logarithmic search to find block correspondences our motion estimation techniques were not employed in encoding these movies balls sequence 88kb cubes spin sequence 131kb findspot sequence 101kb rotbunny sequence 66kb scalebunny sequence 51kb topspin sequence 70kb transbunny sequence 65kb
