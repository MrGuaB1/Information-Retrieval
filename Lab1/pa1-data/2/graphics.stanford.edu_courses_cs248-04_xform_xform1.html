2d transformations 2d transformations cs 248 introduction to computer graphics autumn quarter 2004 marc levoy lecture notes for thursday october 21 table of contents 2d transformations column versus row spaces homogeneous coordinates homogeneous representation of 2d transformations composition of 2d transformations these unit vectors are also called the standard basis vectors restating the result shown above any matrix transforms the standard basis vectors into a set of vectors that form the columns of the matrix in other words an orthogonal matrix transforms its rows taken as column vectors into the standard basis vectors among the many facts listed above about orthogonal matrices we will make particular use later in the course of the fact that the inverse of an orthogonal matrix is equal to its transpose thus the 2d cartesian coordinates occupy the w 1 plane in 3d homogeneous space levoy cs stanford edu copyright 2004 marc levoy last update october 21 2004 03 35 59 pm
