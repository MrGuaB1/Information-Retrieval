the openproof project at csli heterogeneous reasoning the openproof project at csli research a sample solution the student begins by breaking into two cases corresponding to the possible assignments of the names a and b block b might be the front dodecahedron and block a the tetrahedron on the right or block b might be the back dodecahedron next the student claims correctly that these two cases are exhaustive given the information in the first sentence from this the student can conclude that block a is definitely the tetrahedron on the right solving the first goal and hence since we are told that a is large we can apply this information to the diagram this allows the student to observe that there are at least two large tetrahedra solving the second goal this concludes the student's solution back 1 2 3 4 the openproof project csli stanford university csli publications all pages and images on this web site are copyright material the openproof project 2005 2012 version equinox11
