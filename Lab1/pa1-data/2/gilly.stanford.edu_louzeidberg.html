louzeidberg i am a postdoctoral researcher studying the humboldt or jumbo squid dosidicus gigas in the laboratory of william gilly we are investigating the behavioral patterns of this species in the ocean with tags the tags are attached to the animals and record temperature and depth from the time of deployment after a given interval the tags pop off of the animal and float at the surface where they send a portion of the data to a satellite if the tags are retrieved from the ocean the full archived dataset can be utilized we will be tagging squid in both monterey bay california and the gulf of california collaborating with the aquarium we are attempting to design tanks that are less harmful to squid also we will attempt to rear dosidicus gigas eggs if we can return them to the laboratory we have successfully performed artificial fertilization from adults that were captured in the gulf of california before coming to the gilly lab i completed a post doc at the monterey bay aquarium research institute http www mbari org midwater there i was working with bruce robison and the midwater ecology lab using remotely operated vehicles rov we observed and collected jellyfish squid and fish from the deep sea tissue samples were taken for nitrogen and carbon stable isotope analysis the ratio of heavy light isotopes of nitrogen and carbon can indicate trophic level and geographic origins of food sources using this chemical analysis we hope to enhance the current view of the food web of monterey bay also while there we collaborated with bill gilly and chuck baxter to examine the oxygen metabolism of dosidicus gigas as seen in the photos i obtained my ph d from ucla in june of 2003 in the laboratory of william hamner i studied the california market squid loligo opalescens we investigated the early life history of this species focusing on the eggs paralarvae hatchlings and the juveniles for the juvenile study i determined the size and swimming speed in animals in the ocean without a frame of reference there are videos of the juveniles available on the mbari midwater website ultimately we were able to predict the size of the fishery 9 months in advance by taking a census of the paralarvae zeidberg louis d and bruce h robison 2008 reply to watters et al range expansion of the humboldt squid proc nat acad sci 105 3 online only zeidberg louis d 2008 first observations of sneaker mating in the california market squid doryteuthis opalescens cephalopoda myopsida j mar biol assoc 2 biodiversity records 5998 zeidberg louis d and bruce h robison 2007 invasive range expansion by the humboldt squid dosidicus gigas in the eastern north pacific proceedings of the national academy of science 104 31 12948 12950 gilly william f unai markaida charles h baxter barbara a block andre boustany louis zeidberg kim reisenbichler bruce robison gastone bazzino cesar salinas 2006 vertical and horizontal migrations by the jumbo squid dosidicus gigas revealed by electronic tagging mar ecol prog ser 324 1 17 feature article zeidberg louis d william m hamner nilolai p nezlin and annette henry 2006 the fishery of the california market squid loligo opalescens cephalopoda myopsida from 1981 2003 fishery bulletin 104 1 46 59 zeidberg louis d 2004 allometry measurements can determine the size and swimming speeds of juvenile and adult loligo opalescens cephalopoda myopsida squid from in situ video journal of experimental biology 207 4195 4203 zeidberg louis d and hamner william m kristof e moorehead k 2004 egg masses of loligo opalescens cephalopoda myopsida in monterey bay california following the el nino event of 1997 1998 bulletin of marine science 74 1 129 141 zeidberg louis d and hamner william m 2002 age and distribution of squid paralarvae loligo opalescens cephalopoda myopsida in the southern california bight for the three years following the 1997 el nino marine biology 141 111 122 hunt james c louis d zeidberg william m hamner bruce h robison 2000 the behavior of loligo opalescens mollusca cephalopoda as observed by a remotely operated vehicle journal of marine biological assoc uk 80 873 883 email l zeidberg at gmail dot com
