the stanford autonomous helicopter learning for control from multiple demonstrations icml 2008 learning for control from multiple demonstrations abstract we consider the problem of learning to follow a desired trajectory when given a small number of demonstrations from a sub optimal expert we present an algorithm that i extracts the initially unknown desired trajectory from the sub optimal expert's demonstrations and ii learns a local model suitable for control along the learned trajectory we apply our algorithm to the problem of autonomous helicopter flight in all cases the autonomous helicopter's performance exceeds that of our expert helicopter pilot's demonstrations even stronger our results significantly extend the state of the art in autonomous helicopter aerobatics in particular our results include the first autonomous tic tocs loops and hurricane vastly superior performance on previously performed aerobatic maneuvers such as in place flips and rolls and a complete airshow which requires autonomous transitions between these and various other maneuvers full paper learning for control from multiple demonstrations adam coates pieter abbeel and andrew y ng to appear in icml 2008 ps pdf icml joint paper session talk icml joint session talk helsinki finland july 6 2008 videolectures net icml talk slides ppt videos the videos below show the results from our algorithm recorded demonstrations videos show visualizations of the recorded pilot demonstrations for each maneuver aligned demonstrations videos show visualizations of the aligned demonstration trajectories along with the inferred ideal trajectory shown as a white helicopter flight performance video shows a comparison of the actual helicopter trajectory black helicopter along with the desired ideal trajectory white helicopter as displayed by our software during an autonomous flight on the real helicopter autonomous flight videos show the real autonomous flight of the helicopter airshow recorded demonstrations mov aligned demonstrations mov flight performance mov autonomous flight mp4 720x405 mp4 960x540 wmv 960x540 tic toc recorded demonstrations mov aligned demonstrations mov flight performance mov autonomous flight mp4 640x360 mp4 960x540 flips recorded demonstrations mov aligned demonstrations mov flight performance mov autonomous flight mp4 640x360 mp4 960x540 rolls recorded demonstrations mov aligned demonstrations mov flight performance mov autonomous flight mp4 640x360 mp4 960x540 main page stanford university stanford cs department stanford ai lab
