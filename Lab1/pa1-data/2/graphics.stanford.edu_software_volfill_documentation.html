volfill manual volfill manual this is the manual for volfill a program for filling in holes in volumetric data the program was written to read and write vri files but with appropriate file conversion there is nothing preventing this program from working with other file formats contents introduction compiling running the program gui use introduction the volfill program fills in holes using a technique called volumetric diffusion the program was designed to be run on large data sets such as the david and because of this uses run length encoding to store the volumetric data in order to speed up processing two criteria are used to decide on whether data should be blended one measures distance from an active edge d2 and the other measures the distance from a newly created edge d1 each voxel stores its corresponding d1 and d2 value d2 is set to zero when a voxel has an opposite signed neighbor as well as an empty neighbor d1 is set to zero when a voxel has an opposite signed neighbor and is newly created data for other voxels their d1 and d2 values are the minimum value of all of their neighbors plus one compiling to compile the volfill program simply type make in the same directory as the makefile and the source code running the program the usage for volfill is volfill input vri output vri optional parameters where optional parameters are g for graphical display n iterations to specify the number of iterations to blur d1 d1 distance to specify the d1 distance d2 d2 distance to specify the d2 distance p to propgate d2 distances to max before blurring graphical display use volfill also comes with a graphical display that can be used to visualize a slice of the voxel grid it is activated with the g command line option opengl and glut is required to use the graphical mode if you would like to compile the program without these libraries simply comment out the glut function calls in main cc and in fb cc when in the graphical mode the following keys are used to perform actions b to blur the voxel grid one time l to perform n blurs where n is a command line parameter or default w to output the grid to a file a to move up one slice in the grid s to move down one slice in the grid m to output n ppm files 1 visualization of the voxel data values 2 visualization of the d1 values 3 visualization of the d2 values 4 visualization of all values
