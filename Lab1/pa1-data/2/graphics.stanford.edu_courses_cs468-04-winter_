cs 468 introduction to computational topology cs 468 winter 2004 introduction to computational topology by afra zomorodian wednesdays 12 30 2 00 pm starting january 14th gates 392 course lectures the emerging field of computational topology utilizes theory from topology and the power of computing to solving problems in diverse fields recent applications include computer graphics computer aided design cad and structural biology in each case we are interested in understanding the intrinsic shape of some real or abstract space the primary goal of the course is to present basic concepts from topology to enable a non specialist to grasp and participate in current research in computational topology as such this course will not be a readings course in computational topology rather it will present mathematics from a computer scientist's point of view toward the end of the course we will examine recent papers in computational topology i assume mathematical sophistication and familiarity with programming however i do not assume background in topology introduction ps 1 14 4 point set topology ps slides 1 14 4 surface topology ps slides conway's zip 1 21 4 simplicial complexes ps slides 1 28 4 group theory ps slides 2 04 4 homotopy ps slides 2 11 4 homology ps slides 2 18 4 computing homology slides 2 25 4 topology of point cloud data slides 3 03 4 morse theory slides 3 10 4 presentations isosurface topology simplification by wood et al presented by chand john slides ppt 3 10 4 topology matching for fully automatic similarity estimation of 3d shapes by hilaga et al presented by kris hauser slides ppt 3 17 4 optimally cutting a surface into a disk by erickson and har peled presented by nikola milosavljevic slides 3 17 4 supplementary material max eversion paper 1977 outside in 1994 the optiverse 1998 thurston wp and weeks jr the mathematics of three dimensional manifolds scientific american 251 1 1984 distributed in class
