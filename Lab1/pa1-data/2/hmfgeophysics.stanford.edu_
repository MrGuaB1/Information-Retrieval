hmf geophysics there is growing recognition of the challenges we face in many parts of the world in finding and maintaining clean sources of water for human consumption and agricultural use while balancing the needs of the natural world advancements in hydrologic sciences are needed in order to develop an improved understanding of the controls on the quantity movement and quality of water thus enhancing our ability to better protect and manage our water resources geophysical methods can play a central role in these investigations cuahsi consortium of universities for the advancement of hydrologic sciences is developing with the support of the national science foundation a hydrologic measurement facility hmf which contains a geophysics module the geophysics module will support and advance the use of geophysics for hydrologic applications the research effort to develop the geophysics module is referred to as hmf geophysics and is led by rosemary knight and david robinson in the department of geophysics at stanford university over the next three years sept 05 08 we will determine through broad community consultation how best to utilize geophysical instrumentation and engage geophysical expertise in addressing key challenges in the hydrologic sciences our goal is to put in place the infrastructure needed to develop and maintain partnerships between the hydrologic and geophysical communities 2005 hmf geophysics brochure pdf 2006 hmf geophyiscs brochure pdf home forming partnerships hmf geophysics activities related activities hmf geophysics committee
