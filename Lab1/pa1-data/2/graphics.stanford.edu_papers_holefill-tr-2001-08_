filling holes in complex surfaces using volumetric diffusion filling holes in complex surfaces using volumetric diffusion james davis stephen r marschner matt garr and marc levoy technical report tr 2001 08 computer science department stanford university december 2001 at left is a photograph of the head of michelangelo's david at right is a rendered 3d model of a section of his hair corresponding to the square in the photograph the section is 75mm wide on the statue and the spacing between triangle vertices is 1.0 mm although this surface was scanned dozens of times from many different angles occlusions prevented access to the deepest crevices the hole highlighted in this rendering has a complex shape and multiple boundary components ie islands floating in the hole the largest boundary component contains 905 edges hidden portions of this boundary are indicated with broken lines abstract we address the problem of building watertight 3d models from surfaces that contain holes for example sets of range scans that observe most but not all of a surface we specifically address situations in which the holes are too geometrically and topologically complex to fill using triangulation algorithms our solution begins by constructing a signed distance function the zero set of which defines the surface initially this function is defined only in the vicinity of observed surfaces we then apply a diffusion process to extend this function through the volume until its zero set bridges whatever holes may be present if additional information is available such as known empty regions of space inferred from the lines of sight to a 3d scanner it can be incorporated into the diffusion process our algorithm is simple to implement is guaranteed to produce manifold non interpenetrating surfaces and is efficient to run on large datasets because computation is limited to areas near holes paper postscript with color figures pdf 2.8 mb note the is apparently a bug in some acrobat reader plug ins for netscape and explorer that causes them to hang after page 3 while reading this pdf to avoid this bug download the pdf to your hard drive by right clicking on the link in netscape or explorer then open it in acrobat reader this seems to work reliably accompanying video realvideo 320 x 240 100kbs 2mb mpeg 320 x 240 450kbs 12mb mpeg 640 x 480 1800kbs 44mb note this paper is a revision of tr 2001 07 a further and final revision has been accepted for publication in the first international symposium on 3d data processing visualization and transmission
