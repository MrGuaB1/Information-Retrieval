image based lighting 5 rendering 5 rendering the following images show the results of various renders of the studio scene 16 samples per pixel 64 radiance map samples per pixel sample no multiple importance sampling notice how the surface plate is still somewhat noisy and there these annoying black specks with multiple importance sampling the noise situation is much better but the underside of the spheres is a little dark irradiance caching with an error threshold of 0.2 the lighting is better but there are artifacts caused by the irradiance cache interpolation irradiance caching with an error threshold of 0.05 the artifacts are much reduced i stopped here to avoid unnecessarily long render times here is an image of the rendered cars and its matte copyright 2003 eric lee send comments to erl stanford edu last updated on june 9 2003
