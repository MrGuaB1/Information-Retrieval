ignition time measurements page 1 ignition time measurements principal investigator dr ronald k hanson research associates dr jay jeffries dr david davidson research assistant dan haylett overview conventional shock tube ignition time tests rely on the saturation vapor pressure of the fuel to make the gaseous test mixture high concentration mixtures of fuels with lower vapor pressures are more difficult to create heating can aid in achieving higher fuel loadings however some fuel cracking or oxidation may result the aerosol shock tube avoids this issue by using the incident shock wave to vaporize the fuel much higher temperatures can be obtained and the evaporation and diffusion times behind the incident shock can be optimized figure 1 top view of experimental setup page 2 figure 2 side view of experimental setup measurements of ignition time and species concentration time histories are provided by emission pressure pzt and laser absorption extinction fuel concentration measurements are made by absorption of 3.39 m laser light droplet size and load are determined using multi wavelength laser extinction generally in the ir figure 3 sample ignition time data measurement shown above is the data from a typical ignition time experiment the ignition delay time 820 s can be readily identified in the ch emission pzt pressure and 3.39 mm laser absorption signals reflected shock conditions 1122 k 5.2 atm dodecane in 21 o2 ar f 0.5 page 3 figure 4 data comparison the figure above presents ignition times for dodecane in a mixture of 21 o2 ar ignition times are compared to model by ranzi et al 2006
