monte carlo evaluation of non linear scattering equations for subsurface reflection monte carlo evaluation of non linear scattering equations for subsurface reflection matt pharr and pat hanrahan stanford university proceedings of siggraph 2000 abstract we describe a new mathematical framework for solving a wide variety of rendering problems based on a non linear integral scattering equation this framework treats the scattering functions of complex aggregate objects as first class rendering primitives these scattering functions accurately account for all scattering events inside them we also describe new techniques for computing scattering functions from the composition of scattering objects we demonstrate that solution techniques based on this new approach can be more efficient than previous techniques based on radiance transport and the equation of transfer and we apply these techniques to a number of problems in rendering scattering from complex surfaces additional information available paper pdf 249kb paper gzipped postscript 1.1 mb slides from talk pdf 786kb mmp graphics stanford edu
