haptic perception of just noticeable difference between two surfaces page 1 haptic perception of just noticeable difference between two surfaces side by side virtual surfaces with identical stiffness are presented separated by a small gap which requires the user to change the position of the probe when comparing the phantom desktop device was used for haptic feedback due very low friction of motion and the ability to approach surfaces at the same angle which is not possible with the bimanual device the subject repeatedly probes these virtual surfaces while the stiffness of one is changed until the subject can detect a difference in the force feedback this is recorded and the comparison is begun again at the new force level this determines the force differences that can be detected at varying baseline force levels the experiment was performed twice for each subject once with a constant force independent of the probe depth and a second time with the force profile increasing linearly with probe depth there is no network latency results the just noticeable difference experiments show that individuals vary a great deal in their ability to compare force feedback between two samples some users were very sensitive to force increments while others did not report a change until the force difference was much larger in most cases the smallest noticeable force increment is large as the base force increases which is similar to visual and audio perception similar results were obtained from the two force profiles constant and linearly increasing indicating that users are able to probe the two surfaces very consistently to similar depths repeated experimental runs by the same subject often gave widely varying results this variability may depend on several factors a subject becoming comfortable with the experimental apparatus and user fatigue
