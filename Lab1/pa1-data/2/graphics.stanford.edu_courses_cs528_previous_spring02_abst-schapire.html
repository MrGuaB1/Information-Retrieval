robert schapire broad area colloquium for artificial intelligence geometry graphics robotics and vision the boosting approach to machine learning robert schapire at&t labs monday april 29th 2002 4 45pm gates b01 http robotics stanford edu ba colloquium abstract boosting is a general method for producing a very accurate classification rule by combining rough and moderately inaccurate rules of thumb while rooted in a theoretical framework of machine learning boosting has been found to perform quite well empirically in this talk i will introduce the boosting algorithm adaboost and explain the underlying theory of boosting including our explanation of why boosting often does not suffer from overfitting i also will describe some recent applications and extensions of boosting including an application to a human computer spoken dialogue system about the speaker robert schapire received his scb in math and computer science from brown university in 1986 and his sm 1988 and phd 1991 from mit under the supervision of ronald rivest his dissertation on the design and analysis of efficient learning algorithms won the 1991 acm doctoral dissertation award after a short post doc at harvard rob became a member of technical staff at at&t labs formerly at&t bell laboratories where he has been since 1991 his main research interest is in theoretical and applied machine learning contact bac coordinators cs stanford edu back to the colloquium page
