cs348b spring 2009 rendering competition cs348b spring 2009 rendering competition the renderings below were created for the rendering competition in cs348b image synthesis techniques taught by pat hanrahan in the spring quarter of 2009 jerry talton and laurie kim were the tas for the class the competition was held on friday june 5th 2009 the distinguished judges for the competition were matt pharr intel advanced rendering technology group eric enderton nvidia gelato group grand prize glacier caves by abe davis dave jacobs and jongmin baek abe dave and jongmin rendered this amazing picture of an ice cave complete with intrepid snake hating explorer dave generated the ice volumes using a formation and erosion simulation abe created an extensive previsualization pipeline and jongmin implemented volumetric photon mapping more info final image first prize rendering cloth by lingfeng yang ling implemented a bidirectional texture function for cloth materials and extended it to add support for analytic self shadowing more info final image second prize frosty popsicles by shiwei song and loren yu shiwei and loren used solid textures and subsurface scattering to render frosty popsicles more info final image honorable mentions spider webs by zach devito zach implemented a system for automatic spider web generation and then simulated wavelength dependent refraction through the web's threads more info final image pouring wine by soowoung ryu soowoung implemented a smoothed particle hydrodynamic fluid simulation and a tuned transmissive material model to capture the splash of wine in a glass more info final image more great projects coronal ejection by daniel chang and ming jiang daniel and ming rendered the sun with separate models for the photosphere chromosphere corona and coronal ejection loops more info final image corrective vision by david pursell david simulated the human visual system with myopia hyperopia and astigmatism and then used a prescription based lens model to correct the system's vision more info final image oil refinery by daniel gibson and salik sayed daniel and salik modeled and rendered an oil refinery using a ray marching technique to account for heat blur and volumetric photon mapping to account for smoke more info final image relativistic rendering by adam smith and filip gruvstad adam and filip rendered a space scene with relativistic effects including light bending due to gravity and abberation and doppler shift to due the camera moving at relativistic speeds more info final image enchanted tree by shireesh agrawal shireesh used radiosity and light shafts to render a picture of a tree in a cave more info final image waterfall by avi robinson mosher and jonathan su avi and jon simulated and rendered a waterfall with surface spray and mist effects more info final image tennis ball by johnny zhou johnny used a 3d texture model to render the fur on the surface of a tennis ball more info final image
