a rapid hierarchical radiosity algorithm a rapid hierarchical radiosity algorithm pat hanrahan david salzman larry aupperle proceedings of siggraph 1991 abstract this paper presents a rapid hierarchical radiosity algorithm for illuminating scenes containing large polygonal patches the algorithm constructs a hierarchical representation of the form factor matrix by adaptively subdividing patches into subpatches according to a user supplied error bound the algorithm guarantees that all form factors are calculated to the same precision removing many common image artifacts due to inaccurate form factors more importantly the algorithm decomposes the form factor matrix into at most o n blocks where n is the number of elements previous radiosity algorithms represented the element to element transport interactions with n 2 form factors visibility algorithms are given that work well with this approach standard techniques for shooting and gathering can be used with the hierarchical representation to solve for equilibrium radiosities but we also discuss using a brightness weighted error criteria in conjunction with multigridding to even more rapidly progressively refine the image additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper 556k eps rgb compressed tar file of implementation back up to papers index
