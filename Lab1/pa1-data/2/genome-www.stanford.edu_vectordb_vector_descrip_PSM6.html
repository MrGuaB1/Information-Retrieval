bacillus e coli plasmid vector psm6 complete psm6 vector ig sequence link general plasmid ds dna 7503 bp functions cloning selection copy number hosts e coli hb101 e coli suppliers atcc misc comments created by moore july 1995 under contract with ncbi constructed by ligating pbr322 and pe194 after linearizing with psti the ecori site was destroyed and a hpai ssti fragment containing ermc was removed the ermc promoter and ribosome binding sequence was inserted upstream of an ecori linker the ecori cloning site is 4 bp downstream of the ribosome binding sequence psm6 can be maintained in both e coli and b subtilis but can be used as a cloning vector only in e coli because the tetracycline resistance is poorly expressed in b subtilis medium is 1273 lb plus tetracycline parents pbr322 pe194 siblings descendents return to vector homepage
