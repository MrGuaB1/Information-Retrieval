meandering channel reservoir modeling with self avoiding random walk jiahua wang xi an shiyou university china this approach page 1 meandering channel reservoir modeling with self avoiding random walk jiahua wang xi an shiyou university china this approach follows the previous work in the reference 1 1 application of self avoiding random walk algorithm the definitions of the general random walk the non reversal random walk and the self avoiding random walk are made fig 1 2 and 3 this approach consists of the following two parts the first part makes the walk path look like the shape of channel and tries to make all channel well locations be on the channel it considers the main direction of the channel shunning sustained rotation of the walk path fig 5 and the walk path back and forth fig 6 keeping away from wells of no channels in the process of every step of walk the probability of moving along with the main direction is larger than other directions fig 4 2 realization selection as the second part a large amount of the realizations should be removed according to the certain criterions those criterions are locations of wells traversed by meandering channels curvatures and amplitudes of meandering channels channel width etc 3 case study the case study is for an area of an offshore oil field with 32 wells of spacing of about 350m in the east china the sediment includes meandering channel and floodplain the main direction is as in fig 4 the similarity of the channel by geologists to the realizations indicates good availability and validity of this approach fig 7 the channel in the right part of fig 10 is selected by the criterions from 5260000 realizations using 8 hour cpu time on pc references 1 wang j zhang t and huang c the simulation of braided channels in two dimensions with random walk model proc of the 30th int t geol congr vol 25 115 124 1997
