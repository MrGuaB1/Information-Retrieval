assignment 6 assignment 6 landscapes and nature christina christina goeders man and his best friend requirement 4 texture i took this with my xsi and 18 55mm lens at 33mm and with iso 200 in aperture priority mode i wanted to keep much of the image in focus so i used an aperture of f 11 which meant a shutter of 1 200 second i was watching a man roaming along the beach with his dog so i knelt down in the sand to take this picture of the footprints and pawprints because the colors in this image weren t very interesting i decided to make it black and white in photoshop and also add a black border i made some adjustments in curves to ensure the contrast of the bright sand with the shadows in the prints andrew i love this shot i m heavily biased towards dogs christina awww thank you jesse this is simply fantastic obviously since it was shown to the entire class previous back to all photos next
