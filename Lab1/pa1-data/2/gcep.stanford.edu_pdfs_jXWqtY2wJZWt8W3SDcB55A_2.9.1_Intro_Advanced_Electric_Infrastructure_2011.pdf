introduction to advanced electric infrastructure page 1 introduction to advanced electric infrastructure the gcep efforts in advanced electric infrastructure stem from the recognition that a future power system will need to operate differently in a carbon constrained world there are many technical challenges to integrating carbon free energy carriers from renewable resources and other distributed sources into the electricity network the current communication command and control paradigm for the power system cannot accommodate a high penetration of deeply distributed renewable energy or an influx of electric vehicles the requirements for bi directional information and power flows are not in place nor optimized gcep anticipates that the future generation mix will range in load response times and capacities posing complex research issues for power quality asset management network control and reliability the current project in advanced electric infrastructure is a multi institutional effort that examines a system wide effort in the control of the electric network to allow over 50 penetration of renewable energy this team is lead by professor kevin tomsovic at the university of tennessee knoxville and includes three other institutions university of illinois northeastern university tufts university and rensselaer polytechnic institute the researchers are addressing the following five issues flat control and communication framework intelligent device interfaces optimization with multi scale energy sources and demands transmission grid management and operation and test and verification
