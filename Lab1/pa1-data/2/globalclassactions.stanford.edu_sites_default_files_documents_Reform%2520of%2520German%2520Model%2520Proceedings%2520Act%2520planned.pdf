reform of german model proceedings act planned page 1 reform of german model proceedings act planned the german ministry of justice has released a draft for a reform of the kapitalanleger musterverfahrensgesetz kapmug the german law on model procedures for mass claims in capital markets cases the draft needs approval by parliament which is expected for early 2012 the original draft in german can be accessed here http www bmj de shareddocs downloads de pdfs refe_kapmug pdf the main proposal in the draft ist to delete the sunset clause in the kapmug currently ending in october 2012 so that the kapmug would become a permanent part of german procedural law the area of application of the kapmug is also enlarged slightly to include not only tort claims but also contract based claims that involve false information of the capital markets eg claims against banks or other advisors however the ministry did not follow academic proposals to include the model procedure into the general procedural law and thus open it up to other types of mass claims according to the ministry more experience with the model procedure is still needed before that step could be taken the ministry also refused to create an opt in participation possibility for the model procedure it therefore still requires an individual suit by every claimant with the associated large cost risks in a loser pays system large parts of the draft cover technical improvements that are designed to speed up the model procedure which has been very slow in many cases especially in the famous deutsche telekom securities case which is now going into its tenth year before the frankfurt courts in addition it is planned that the model plaintiff's attorney may receive some extra compensation for his work in addition to ordinary statutory attorney's fees depending on the value of the claims but not exceeding about 27000 practitioners have already commented that this amount will probably not create much more incentives for the involved plaintiffs attorneys but that they will instead as they do already resort to third party litigation funding and other schemes which are designed to circumvent the strict rules on contingency fees that are currently in place in germany the draft finally tries to facilitate settlements by introducing for the first time in german procedural law the possibility of a court approved settlement which would then be binding on all model procedure participants unless they opt out of the settlement after notification the ministry explicitly points to the settlement rules that are in force in the netherlands in this respect contrary to the dutch rules however the kapmug settlement would be binding only on those claimants who have already filed an individual suit and not on all other silent claim holders more information prof axel halfmeier frankfurt school of finance & management
