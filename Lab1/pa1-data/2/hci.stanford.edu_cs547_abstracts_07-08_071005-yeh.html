pcd 10 05 07 yeh designing interactions that combine pen paper and pc ron b yeh department of computer science stanford university ronyeh cs stanford edu seminar on people computers and design stanford university october 5 2007 pen and paper are powerful tools for visualizing designs penning music and communicating through art and written language this pairing provides many benefits it is mobile flexible and robust our use of paper has even adapted to fit into today's electronic workplace we print electronic documents so that we can annotate them we scribble meeting notes on pads before we type them up and email them to our colleagues we sometimes attach sticky notes to our lcd monitors because writing down a to do can be faster than entering it into our online task list my work explores how we can combine the power of pen and paper with the benefits of computation including search remote collaboration and data storage in this talk i will discuss the impact that this will have on end users and the software developers that will have to create these applications first i will describe our observational study of field biology researchers one example of a community that will benefit from this technology second i will present a set of interactions to demonstrate the potential of pen and paper computing finally i will describe a toolkit architecture and development environment that will enable programmers to create these applications ron yeh is a ph d candidate in computer science at stanford university he studies human computer interaction and is advised by scott klemmer he has also worked closely with andreas paepcke and terry winograd much of his work is part of bioact which contributes new technology approaches for field biology researchers he received his bs in eecs from uc berkeley in 2001 view this talk on line at cs547 on stanford online or using this video link titles and abstracts for previous years are available by year and by speaker
