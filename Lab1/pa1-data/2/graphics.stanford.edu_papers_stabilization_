digital video stabilization and rolling shutter correction using gyroscopes digital video stabilization and rolling shutter correction using gyroscopes alexandre karpenko stanford university david jacobs stanford university jongmin baek stanford university marc levoy stanford university stanford university computer science tech report cstr 2011 03 september 2011 a videos captured with a cell phone camera tend to be shaky due to the device's size and weight b the rolling shutter used by sensors in these cameras also produces warping in the output frames we have exagerrated the effect for illustrative purposes c we use gyroscopes to measure the camera's rotations during video capture d we use the measured camera motion to stabilize the video and to rectify the rolling shutter golden gate photo courtesy of salim virji abstact in this paper we present a robust real time video stabilization and rolling shutter correction technique based on commodity gyroscopes first we develop a unified algorithm for modeling camera motion and rolling shutter warping we then present a novel framework for automatically calibrating the gyroscope and camera outputs from a single video capture this calibration allows us to use only gyroscope data to effectively correct rolling shutter warping and to stabilize the video using our algorithm we show results for videos featuring large moving foreground objects parallax and low illumination we also compare our method with commercial image based stabilization algorithms we find that our solution is more robust and computationally inexpensive finally we implement our algorithm directly on a mobile phone we demonstrate that by using the phone's inbuilt gyroscope and gpu we can remove camera shake and rolling shutter artifacts in real time tech report 5.2 mb video overview 200 mb source code alexandre karpenko 2011
