wide area camera calibration using virtual calibration objects page 1 comparison with traditional calibration wide area camera calibration using virtual calibration objects xing chen james davis philipp slusallek goal calibrate many cameras arranged to cover a wide area working volume building a large physical calibration object is impractical solution build a large virtual calibration object that covers the entire working volume method use all cameras to observe a moving object iterate between solving for the object path and using this path as a virtual calibration object to solve for camera position a space in which a comparison with traditional calibration is possible projection error of a moving object note that the quality of the calibration obtained using our method compares favorably with traditional calibration methods traditional calibration virtual calibration object initial one iteration five iterations results camera arrangement to be calibrated note that since the cameras cover a wide area traditional calibration is not possible projection error as a function of iterations using a virtual calibration object note that very stable convergence to the correct camera calibration is obtained initial three iterations forty iterations structure from motion global unification ekf based physical point tracking virtual object creation traditional camera calibration 2d 2d image correspondences rough global camera pose pair wise camera relations 3d object trace 3d 2d correspondences structure from motion global unification ekf based physical point tracking virtual object creation traditional camera calibration 2d 2d image correspondences rough global camera pose pair wise camera relations 3d object trace 3d 2d correspondences improved global camera pose improved global camera pose example object path page 2
