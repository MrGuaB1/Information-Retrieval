particle physics units particle physics units energy the fundamental unit used for most measurements in particle physics is the electron volt a unit of energy abbreviated ev an ev is the kinetic energy that an electron gets when it is accelerated under a voltage difference of 1 volt so if you hold an electron near the negative electrode of a 1 volt battery and then let it go it will have a kinetic energy of 1 ev when it reaches the positive electrode a gev is a giga electron volt or 1 billion electron volts the ev is a very small unit of energy for example consider the 10.58 gev available in the collisions at the babar detector converted to si units this is 1.7 10 9 joules of energy for comparison calculate in joules the kinetic energy of a baseball mass 0.145 kg thrown at 90 mph 40 m s solution momentum as you know the formula for kinetic energy is e 12 mv 2 and the formula for momentum is p mv notice that the unit for energy is the unit for momentum times a velocity in particle physics we use this relationship to express the unit for momentum in terms of the unit for energy divided by a velocity namely the speed of light denoted c since we use the gev to measure energy our momentum unit is gev c mass we use the same argument again to derive a unit for mass the units of momentum divided by a velocity the speed of light c gives a unit of mass so for measurements of mass we use the unit gev c 2 last modified tue nov 2 14 55 34 pst 2004
