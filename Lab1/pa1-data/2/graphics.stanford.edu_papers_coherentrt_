rendering complex scenes with memory coherent ray tracing rendering complex scenes with memory coherent ray tracing matt pharr craig kolb reid gershbein and pat hanrahan stanford university to appear in proceedings of siggraph 97 abstract simulating realistic lighting and rendering complex scenes are usually considered separate problems with incompatible solutions accurate lighting calculations are typically performed using ray tracing algorithms which require that the entire scene database reside in memory to perform well conversely most systems capable of rendering complex scenes use scan conversion algorithms that access memory coherently but are unable to incorporate sophisticated illumination we have developed algorithms that use caching and lazy creation of texture and geometry to manage scene complexity to improve cache performance we increase locality of reference by dynamically reordering the rendering computation based on the contents of the cache we have used these algorithms to compute images of scenes containing millions of primitives while storing ten percent of the scene description in memory thus a machine of a given memory capacity can render realistic scenes that are an order of magnitude more complex than was previously possible additional information available paper with color figures in adobe pdf 1.37 mb paper without color figures in adobe pdf 103kb color plates figure 2 figure 2 figure 3 mmp graphics stanford edu
