assignment 4 architecture and interiors assignment 4 architecture and interiors stuart stuart upfill brown reaaaaally cool stairwell in the gsb library i went to the bottom of the stairwell and took a photo looking directly up it was pretty dark down there and i really wanted to keep iso down so i took several longer exposure photos this one had the least blur the lights were a little harsh so in photoshop i messed with vibrance and contrast and white balance to dampen the lights and have them match the color of the stairwell a bit more previous back to all photos next
