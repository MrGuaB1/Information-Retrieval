filling holes in complex surfaces using volumetric diffusion filling holes in complex surfaces using volumetric diffusion steve marschner james davis matt garr and marc levoy technical report tr 2001 07 computer science department stanford university january 2001 abstract we address the problem of building watertight 3d models from surfaces that contain holes for example sets of range scans that observe most but not all of a surface we specifically address situations in which the holes are too geometrically and topologically complex to fill using triangulation algorithms our solution begins by constructing a signed distance function the zero set of which defines the surface initially this function is defined only in the vicinity of observed surfaces we then apply a diffusion process to extend this function through the volume until its zero set bridges whatever holes may be present if additional information is available such as known empty regions of space inferred from the lines of sight to a 3d scanner it can be incorporated into the diffusion process our algorithm is simple to implement is guaranteed to produce manifold non interpenetrating surfaces and is efficient to run on large datasets because computation is limited to areas near holes by showing results for complex range scans we demonstrate that our algorithm produces hole free surfaces that are plausible visually acceptable and usually close to the intended geometry paper postscript with color figures pdf 1.9 mb video submission realvideo streaming 450kbs realvideo streaming 221kbs realvideo streaming 34kbs realvideo 640x480 450kbs 8.2 mb realvideo 640x480 221kbs 4.4 mb realvideo 640x480 34kbs 720kb note for a revised version of this technical report see tr 2001 08 a further and final revision has been accepted for publication in the first international symposium on 3d data processing visualization and transmission
