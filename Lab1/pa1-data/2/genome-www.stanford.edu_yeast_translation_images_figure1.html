figure 1 figure 1 obtaining polysome profiles by microarray analysis a representative absorbance profile for rna separated by velocity sedimentation through a 10 50 sucrose gradient see methods the positions of the 40s 60s 80s and polysomal peaks are indicated the expected peaks for the trnas and other small rnas in fractions 1 and 2 are obscured by the high absorbance presumably from proteins and detergent used in the preparation b rna was extracted from each of the fourteen fractions and an aliquot from each fraction was subjected to electrophoresis through a formaldehyde gel transferred to a nylon membrane and stained with methylene blue as expected 25s and 18s ribosomal rnas were the prominent species markers not shown c rna aliquots from each fraction were reverse transcribed to incorporate cy5 dutp and a common reference unfractionated rna was reverse transcribed in the presence of cy3 dutp the resulting labeled cdnas from each fraction and the common reference were mixed then hybridized to a dna microarray containing all yeast orfs as predicted from the genome sequence saccharomyces genome database known concentrations of b subtilis mrnas were added to each sample immediately at collection to allow normalization of rna levels and comparison between fractions see text
