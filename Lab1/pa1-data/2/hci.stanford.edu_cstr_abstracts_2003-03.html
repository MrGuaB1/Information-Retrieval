data parallel computation on graphics hardware data parallel computation on graphics hardware ian buck pat hanrahan computer science department stanford university tech report date published abstract as the programmability and performance of modern gpus continues to increase many researchers are looking to graphics hardware to solve problems previously performed on general purpose cpus in many cases performing general purpose computation on graphics hardware can provide a significant advantage over implementations on traditional cpus however if gpus are to become a powerful processing resource it is important to establish the correct abstraction of the hardware this will encourage efficient application design as well as an optimizable interface for hardware designers in this paper we present a stream processor abstraction for performing data parallel computation using graphics hardware in this model computation is expressed as kernels executing over streams of data we have implemented this abstraction with current programmable hardware in a system called emph brook and present a variety of applications demonstrating its functionality stream computing not only represents an accurate computational model for today's hardware but it also captures the underlying advantage of computing on graphics hardware datapargfx pdf 154k
