figure 1 genome wide measurement of dna copy number alteration by array cgh a dna copy number profiles are illustrated for cell lines containing different numbers of x chromosomes for breast cancer cell lines and for breast tumors each row represents a different cell line or tumor and each column represents one of 6691 different mapped human genes present on the microarray ordered by genome map position from 1pter through xqter moving average symmetric 5 nearest neighbors fluorescence ratios test reference are depicted using a log2 based pseudocolor scale indicated such that red luminescence reflects fold amplification green luminescence reflects fold deletion and black indicates no change gray indicates poorly measured data b enlarged view of dna copy number profiles across the x chromosome shown for cell lines containing different numbers of x chromosomes
