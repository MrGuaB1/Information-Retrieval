assignment 1 bad photos assignment 1 bad photos yashraj yashraj narang the case of the missing girl my favorite picture of this assignment i had a friend lie down on a stretch of sunlit sand on the beach i overexposed her face to make her featureless fortunately she has very light skin so this wasn t too difficult it ended up looking exactly how i wanted it like the cover of a horror novel meets requirement 1 poorly exposed used a large aperture to do this increased the contrast in her hair to make the strands stand out and converted it to grayscale to make it look like a pencil drawing previous back to all photos next
