artificial neural network approach to selection of eor method jong se lim korea maritime university enhanced oil recovery eo page 1 artificial neural network approach to selection of eor method jong se lim korea maritime university enhanced oil recovery eor has gained more attention as the results of increasing oil prices and higher oil demands a large number of eor methods have been developed but the selection of eor method according to the reservoir characteristics is still a challenging task to the petroleum engineer one of the main tools used to predict the eor efficiency is a reservoir simulation which requires detailed reservoir description that may not be available or maybe unreliable at the initial evaluation stage and also needs extensive time the other method is to use an expert opinion but it tends to be biased by the expert's operational experience this paper proposes an artificial neural network ann approach to enable the petroleum engineer to select the appropriate eor method based on the reservoir characteristics the input layer of the ann consists of key reservoir parameters such as reservoir depth temperature porosity permeability initial oil saturation oil gravity and in situ oil viscosity the output layer is composed of five eor methods to be selected steam co2 miscible hydrocarbon miscible in situ combustion polymer the number of hidden layers and neurons are optimized during the training by repeated trial and error after the ann is trained successfully with the successful eor field data the model is tested against the new data which are not used for training and the data having certain level of error which can be included in the input respectively a series of test results showed that the ann model developed in this study can be used to select the most appropriate eor process in a very short and cost effective way
