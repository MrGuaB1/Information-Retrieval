space time hierarchical occlusion culling for micropolygon rendering with motion blur space time hierarchical occlusion culling for micropolygon rendering with motion blur solomon boulos edward luong kayvon fatahalian henry moreton pat hanrahan proceedings of high performance graphics 2010 to appear abstract occlusion culling using a traditional hierarchical depth buffer or z pyramid is less effective when rendering with motion blur we present a new data structure the tz pyramid that extends the traditional z pyramid to represent scene depth values in time this temporal information improves culling efficacy when rendering with motion blur the tz pyramid allows occlusion culling to adapt to the amount of scene motion providing a balance of high efficacy with large motion and low cost in terms of depth comparisons when motion is small compared to a traditional z pyramid using the tz pyramid for occlusion culling reduces the number of micropolygons shaded by up to 3.5 x in addition to better culling the tz pyramid reduces the number of depth comparisons by up to 1.4 x paper pdf 11 mb posted 5 20 2010
