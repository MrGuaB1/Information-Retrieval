project to build a 3d fax machine project to build a 3d fax machine there is a growing interest in the graphics vision and manufacturing communities in building an inexpensive device capable of digitizing the shape and external appearance of objects for transmission display and numerically controlled fabrication applications for such a device include product design fast prototyping reverse engineering and digitizing of shapes for the visual simulation animation and entertainment industries toward this end we have been developing a laser based scanning system capable of generating an occlusion free low level geometric description of the externally visible surfaces of an object here is a flow chart of the process this flow chart is somewhat out of date the crucial step in this process is the merging of multiple range images each of which captures only one side of the object in order to produce a seamless description of the entire object the representations we have investigated for this step include dense polygon meshes and 3d voxel arrays with an occupancy function at each voxel both representations eventually lead to a dense polygon mesh we have also been exploring methods for fitting curved surface patches to these dense meshes future investigations include automatically determining the next best view and acquiring surface reflectivity as an application of this technology we have embarked on a multi year project to create a high quality 3d archive of the sculptures of michelangelo for scholarly educational and commercial purposes in other words the 3d fax machine project has morphed into the digital michelangelo project people brian curless curless cs washington edu daniel goldman dg cs stanford edu hua ge huage leland stanford edu venkat krishnamurthy venkat cs stanford edu marc levoy kari pulli kapu graphics stanford edu greg turk turk redclay stanford edu afra zomorodian afra cs stanford edu recent papers in this area zippered polygon meshes from range images greg turk and marc levoy proc siggraph 94 better optical triangulation through spacetime analysis brian curless and marc levoy proc iccv 95 a volumetric method for building complex models from range images brian curless and marc levoy proc siggraph 96 fitting smooth surfaces to dense polygon meshes venkat krishnamurthy and marc levoy proc siggraph 96 new methods for surface reconstruction from range images brian curless ph d thesis june 1997 fitting smooth surfaces to dense polygon meshes venkat krishnamurthy ph d dissertation stanford university january 1998 available software and data zippack polygon mesh zippering package vrippack volumetric range image processing package now including source code the scanalyze software package used to align and merge range data in the digital michelangelo project volfill our diffusion based hole filler for large polygon meshes the stanford 3d scanning repository an experimental repository of 3d models from the digital michelangelo project demos movies of a zippered polygon mesh model of a plastic toy lion with explanations renderings and 3d fax of 2 million polygon model of a happy buddha constructed from multiple range images using a volumetric method financial support national science foundation interval research corporation if images on this page look dark to you see our note about gamma correction a list of technical papers with abstracts and pointers to additional information is also available or you can return to the research projects page or our home page copyright 1994 1995 1996 1997 marc levoy last update february 19 2006 09 38 56 pm
