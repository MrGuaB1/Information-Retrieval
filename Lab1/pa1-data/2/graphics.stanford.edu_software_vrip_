vrippack volumetric range image processing package vrippack volumetric range image processing package vrippack is a package for volumetrically merging a set of range images developed as part of the project to build a 3d fax machine it is based on a new approach to surface reconstruction from range images see brian curless and marc levoy a volumetric method for building complex models from range images proceedings of siggraph96 vrippack is being made available for research and commercial use free of charge as described at the bottom of this web page a closely related software package is volfill our diffusion based hole filler for large polygon meshes table of contents vrippack overview vrippack software distribution vrippack documentation vrippack overview vrippack is a set of source code scripts and binaries for creating surface reconstructions from range images this package has the following features merges range images into a compressed volumetric grid extracts a surface from the compressed volumetric grid can fill holes in the reconstruction by carving out empty space removes small triangles from the reconstruction performs a simple 4 level decimation for interactive rendering note that vrippack is designed for merging but not aligning range images we also distribute the scanalyze package which does have an alignment feature vrippack software distribution the current release of vrippack is version 0.31 which is a beta release vrippack for linux and cygwin compressed tar file containing source code scripts and linux binaries the binaries are linked against tcl tk version 8.4 shared libaries under linux it is best if these libraries are already installed on your system but copies for run time use are provided in this distribution alternatively you may re compile against another version of tcl tk vrippack for sgi compressed tar file containing source code scripts and irix binaries for vrippack version 0.2 the irix code base is not actively maintained we welcome questions suggestions comments and bug reports from users of vrippack however we do not guarantee timely responses to them in particular the developers have long since graduated and left stanford email should be sent to vrip question at graphics dot stanford dot edu vrippack documentation roadmap to the code base html version of the vrippack user's guide pdf version of the vrippack user's guide distribution notice copyright 2006 the board of regents of the university of washington and the board of trustees of the leland stanford junior university all rights reserved during the period 1995 2007 this software was covered by the stanford computer graphics laboratory's custom written general software license this license is royalty free nonexclusive and nontransferable click here to view its terms and conditions in modification of these terms and conditions users were permitted to distribute or sell derivatives of this software without accounting to stanford or the developers and without payment of royalties to stanford or the developers however title and copyright to the software and documentation remained with stanford and users were required to acknowledge the contribution of stanford in any derivatives as detailed in the license for downloads beginning on august 23 2007 this software is covered by a new general software license which is based on the bsd license last update august 1 2010 10 49 17 am
