deterministic texture analysis and synthesis using tree structure vector quantization deterministic texture analysis and synthesis using tree structure vector quantization li yi wei stanford university abstract texture analysis and synthesis is very important for computer graphics vision and image processing this paper describes an algorithm which can produce new textures with a matching visual appearance from a given example image our algorithm is based on a model that characterizes textures using a nonlinear deterministic function during analysis an example texture is summarized into this function using tree structure vector quantization an output texture initially random noise is then synthesized from this estimated function compared to existing approaches our algorithm can efficiently generate a wide variety of textures the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using standard test images from the brodatz texture album proceedings of the xii brazilian symposium on computer graphics and image processing copyright c 1998 institute of electrical and electronics engineers inc all rights reserved additional information available full paper in gzipped postscript uncompressed postscript or pdf also available online at ieee computer society liyiwei graphics stanford edu
