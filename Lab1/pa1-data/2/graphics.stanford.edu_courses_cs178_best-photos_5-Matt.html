assignment 5 still life assignment 5 still life matt matt bush vanity this photo is a themed collection with the theme of vanity i took the traditional symbols of vanity mirror comb jewels coins purse and replaced them with what i thought of as masculine 21st century equivalents iphone in front facing camera mode razor sunglasses cash luxury car keys and more to an extent i tried to make the classic skull appear by having the sunglasses and phone be the eye holes rather self referentially and the keys be the nose hole i had to do a lot of burning and dodging of shadows to get this effect and it still is incomplete besides the skull i arranged the rest of the elements to achieve color balance the tan of the protein bar and jeans logo patch across from each other the blue of the razor and the american express logo etc background i used levi's jeans as the background since denim is often seen as a sexualized yet masculine fabric fitting with the theme this conveniently allowed me to stick some of the items in pockets which looked natural and fitting lighting i lit the scene with two spot lights from the front at angles so there weren t any completely shadowed areas i took the photo from above the scene and had to do a handheld shot with high iso with multiple shots one of them came out clear enough to use i cropped color balanced denoised burned dodged and sharpened the photo in photoshop previous back to all photos next
