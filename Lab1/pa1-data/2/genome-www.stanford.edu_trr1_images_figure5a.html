figure 5a figure 5a effect of trr1 deficiency on global gene expression patterns poly a rna was isolated from untreated dby7286 and dby7286 trr1 labelled and hybridized to microarrays the expression profile was then compared to the expression profiles of dby7286 and dby7286 yap1 treated with 0.3 mm h2o2 14 and dby7286 overexpressing yap1p 26 column 1 corresponds to untreated dby7286 trr1 versus untreated dby7286 column 2 corresponds to dby7286 treated with 0.3 mm h2o2 versus untreated dby7286 column 3 corresponds to dby7286 yap1 treated with 0.3 mm h2o2 versus untreated dby7286 yap1 and column 4 corresponds to untreated dby7286 overexpressing yap1 versus untreated dby7286 gray boxes denote missing data a plus sign to the left of the columns indicates genes that contain greather than 1 putative yap1p binding site 5 ttag ctaa or 5 ttagtca within 1000 bp of the initiating codon and an asterisk in the gene annotation indicates genes likely to cross hybridize the gene names and functions to the right of the columns are taken from http genome www stanford edu saccharomyces
