polaris a system for query analysis and visualization of multidimensional relational databases extended article polaris a system for query analysis and visualization of multidimensional relational databases extended article chris stolte diane tang and pat hanrahan computer science department stanford university ieee transactions on visualization and computer graphics vol 8 no 1 january march 2002 abstract in the last several years large multidimensional databases have become common in a variety of applications such as data warehousing and scientific computing analysis and exploration tasks place significant demands on the interfaces to these databases because of the size of the data sets dense graphical representations are more effective for exploration than spreadsheets and charts furthermore because of the exploratory nature of the analysis it must be possible for the analysts to change visualizations rapidly as they pursue a cycle involving first hypothesis and then experimentation in this paper we present polaris an interface for exploring large multi dimensional databases that extends the well known pivot table interface the novel features of polaris include an interface for constructing visual specifications of table based graphical displays and the ability to generate a precise set of relational queries from the visual specifications the visual specifications can be rapidly and incrementally developed giving the analyst visual feedback as they construct complex queries and visualizations pdf 4.54 mb chris stolte last modified sat aug 5 12 12 31 pdt 2000
