display of surfaces from volume data display of surfaces from volume data marc levoy ieee computer graphics and applications vol 8 no 3 may 1988 pp 29 37 3rd most frequently cited paper in the computer graphics literature according to google scholar abstract in this article we explore the application of volume rendering techniques to the display of surfaces from sampled scalar functions of three spatial dimensions it is not necessary to fit geometric primitives to the sampled data images are formed by directly shading each sample and projecting it onto the picture plane surface shading calculations are performed at every voxel with local gradient vectors serving as surface normals in a separate step surface classification operators are applied to obtain a partial opacity for every voxel operators that detect isovalue contour surfaces and region boundary surfaces are presented independence of shading and classification calculations insures an undistorted visualization of 3 d shape non binary classification operators insure that small or poorly defined features are not lost the resulting colors and opacities are composited from back to front along viewing rays to form an image the technique is simple and fast yet displays surfaces exhibiting smooth silhouettes and few other aliasing artifacts the use of selective blurring and super sampling to further improve image quality is also described examples from two applications are given molecular graphics and medical imaging additional information available unformatted paper troff 36 kb formatted paper without figures pdf 97 kb optical scan of paper as it appeared in ieee cg&a powerpoint 1.7 mb or html slide show some of the volume datasets used in this paper are available in the stanford volume data archive about the error in this paper there is an error in this paper figure 1 suggests that voxel colors and opacities should be interpolated separately during ray tracing resampling this only works correctly if the colors have been premultiplied by the opacities as suggested by porter and duff 1 before interpolation if this is not done then low opacity colors may mix on equal terms with high opacity colors leading to color bleeding artifacts at the boundaries between differently colored regions of the volume the necessity to premultiply colors by opacities was not made clear in the paper this error and the visual artifacts it may cause is nicely described in a paper by wittenbrink malzbender and goss 2 however contrary to the impression one might get from reading their paper the error in my 1988 paper is only in the exposition not in the implementation as i say in a letter to the editor 3 of ieee computer graphics and applications the images in my 1988 paper and in my later papers are correct the code used to produce these images incorporated in 1994 into lacroute and levoy's 4 free volpack software package is also correct despite this there is a us patent 5 covering the improved volume rendering algorithm described in 2 i hope no company is paying a licensing fee on this invalid patent references 1 porter t duff t compositing digital images proc siggraph 84 acm 1984 pp 253 259 2 wittenbrink c malzbender t goss m opacity weighted color interpolation for volume sampling proc 1998 symposium on volume visualization acm october 1998 pp 135 142 3 levoy m error in volume rendering paper was in exposition only ieee computer graphics and applications vol 20 no 4 july august 2000 p 6 4 lacroute p and levoy m fast volume rendering using a shear warp factorization of the viewing transformation proc siggraph 94 acm 1994 pp 451 458 5 malzbender t goss me opacity weighted color interpolation for volume sampling us patent 6278459 filed august 20 1997 issued august 21 2001 this page copyright 2000 2010 by marc levoy the paper copyright 1988 by ieee
