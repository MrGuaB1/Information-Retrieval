wiregl a scalable graphics system for clusters wiregl a scalable graphics system for clusters greg humphreys matthew eldridge ian buck gordon stoll matthew everett and pat hanrahan appears in proceedings of siggraph 2001 abstract we describe wiregl a system for scalable interactive rendering on a cluster of workstations wiregl provides the familiar opengl api to each node in a cluster virtualizing multiple graphics accelerators into a sort first parallel renderer with a parallel interface we also describe techniques for reassembling an output image from a set of tiles distributed over a cluster using flexible display management wiregl can drive a variety of output devices from standalone displays to tiled display walls by combining the power of virtual graphics the familiarity and ordered semantics of opengl and the scalability of clusters we are able to create time varying visualizations that sustain rendering performance over 70000000 triangles per second at interactive refresh rates using 16 compute nodes and 16 rendering nodes paper adobe pdf format 284k greg humphreys
