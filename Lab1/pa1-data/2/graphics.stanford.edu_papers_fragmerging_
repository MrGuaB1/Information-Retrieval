reducing shading on gpus using quad fragment merging reducing shading on gpus using quad fragment merging kayvon fatahalian solomon boulos james hegarty kurt akeley william r mark henry moreton pat hanrahan proceedings of siggraph 2010 to appear abstract current gpus perform a significant amount of redundant shading when surfaces are tessellated into small triangles we address this inefficiency by augmenting the gpu pipeline to gather and merge rasterized fragments from adjacent triangles in a mesh this approach has minimal impact on output image quality is amenable to implementation in fixed function hardware and when rendering pixel sized triangles requires only a small amount of buffering to reduce overall pipeline shading work by a factor of eight we find that a fragment shading pipeline with this optimization is competitive with the reyes pipeline approach of shading at micropolygon vertices and in cases of complex occlusion can perform up to two times less shading work paper pdf 8.5 mb quicktime video 300 mb posted 5 5 2010
