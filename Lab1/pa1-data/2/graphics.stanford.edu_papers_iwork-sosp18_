system support for interactive workspaces system support for interactive workspaces brad johanson shankar ponnekanti emre kiciman caesar sengupta armando fox unpublished abstract while work has been done on connectivity mobility and general rendezvous systems for ubiquitous computing environments research has been hampered by the lack of higher level application abstractions to identify what these might be we constructed a prototype ubiquitous computing environment which we call an interactive workspace and observed how application writers attempted to use its facilities we also identify system support issues for ubiquitous computing that differ from their counterparts in traditional single node computing and use them to guide the design of a set of abstractions to support ubiquitous computing applications deployed in spaces such as ours our implemented prototype meta operating system iros and several applications in daily use on top of it suggest that we have made progress toward the goal of pro viding support for application level ubiquitous computing abstractions in a way that is robust to transient failures extensible portable across installations and easy to program finally as we consider future work we argue that the abstractions we identified moving data around moving interfaces around and coordinating the behavior of existing monolithic applications are fundamental to this style of ubiquitous computing generally pdf version 190 kb
