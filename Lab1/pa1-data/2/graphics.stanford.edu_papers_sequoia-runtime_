a portable runtime interface for multi level memory hierarchies a portable runtime interface for multi level memory hierarchies mike houston ji young park manman ren timothy knight kayvon fatahalian alex aiken william j dally pat hanrahan to appear ppopp 2008 abstract we present a platform independent runtime interface for moving data and computation through parallel machines with multi level memory hierarchies we show that this interface can be used as a compiler target and can be implemented easily and efficiently on a variety of platforms the interface design allows us to compose multiple runtimes achieving portability across machines with multiple memory levels we demonstrate portability of programs across machines with two memory levels with runtime implementations for multi core smp machines the sti cell broadband engine a distributed memory cluster and disk systems we also demonstrate portability across machines with multiple memory levels by composing runtimes and running on a cluster of smp nodes out of core algorithms on a sony playstation 3 pulling data from disk and a cluster of sony playstation 3's with this uniform interface we achieve good performance for our applications and maximize bandwidth and computational resources on these system configurations bibtex inproceedings sequoia_ppopp08 author mike houston and ji young park and manman ren and timothy knight and kayvon fatahalian and alex aiken and william j dally and pat hanrahan title a portable runtime interface for multi level memory hierarchies booktitle p roceedings of the 2008 acm sigplan s ymposium on p rinciples and p ractices of p arallel p rogramming year 2008 posted 12 2 2007
