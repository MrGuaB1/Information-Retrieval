e coli plasmid vector prfs13 incomplete lac promoter at arac 5 prfs13 vector ig sequence link general plasmid ds dna 202 bp functions cloning selection copy number hosts e coli suppliers misc comments hypersynthesis of arac protein has been accomplished by deleting some of the 5 noncoding dna in front of the arac gene and inserting a 95 bp lac fragment containing the promoter and the ribosome binding site the level of the arac protein was increased 5000 times over that in the wild type gene hypersynthesis however does not require the lac ribosome binding site apparently a sequence already present in front of the arac gene ggag base pairs 180 183 can serve as an efficient binding site clone prfs20a another clone that causes hypersynthesis of the arac protein is missing 17 bp in the lac direction including the ribosome binding site and 21 bp in the arac direction it appears in another entry ncbi gi 207980 parents prfs10 prfs11 pgl101 from plj3 siblings prfs20a prfs15 descendents ncbi entrez link return to vector homepage
