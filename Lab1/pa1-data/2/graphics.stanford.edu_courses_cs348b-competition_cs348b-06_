cs348b spring 2006 rendering competition cs348b spring 2006 rendering competition the renderings below were created for the rendering competition in cs348b image synthesis techniques taught by pat hanrahan in the spring quarter of 2006 meng yu and kayvon fatahalian were the tas for the class the competition was held on friday june 9th 2006 the distinguished judges for the competition were james davis professor of computer science uc santa cruz ren ng stanford graphics lab phd graduate and digital photography extraordinaire grand prize lilypads by tom brow & ranjitha kumar tom and ranjitha produced this year's winning entry by procedurally modeling lilypads using mathematica and simulating single layer subsurface scattering of light through the pads as well as volumetric scattering of light through the water in the scene more info first prize the caterpillar by tarang vaish & shradha budhiraja tarang and shradha implemented jenson's hierarchical subsurface scattering technique as well as procedural texture generation to produce this image of a caterpillar more info honorable mention ice by yi lang mok & joyce pan to make this picture of an ice cube yi lang and joyce generated the distribution of tiny air bubbles within the ice and used bump mapping on the model's surface to produce a realistic appearance more info bonzai by bill dwyer bill devised his own algorithm for generating the geometry of this bonzai tree more info foam by sean rosenbaum & mattias bergbom sean and mattias handle the geometric intersections between many soap bubbles as well as the thin film appearance effects of soapy water in their project they also procedurally generated the leaves in this scene more info diffraction by doug johnston & paul tarjan doug and paul simulated wave interference and diffraction using huygen's principal to create this amazing picture of light shining upon a micron scale snowman more info more great projects lava & molten materials by lee hendrickson & ryan smith lee and ryan use the temperature of molten lava to calculate it's radiative spectrum and visible intensity the radiating material is used as an importance sampled area light source in the scene the texture of the molten materials is procedurally generated more info inside of a leaf by kurt berglund kurt investigated the scattering properties of the various structural layers within leaves and implemented a multiple scattering simulation to produce this image more info hard at work by murad akhter & hyun gu lee murad and hyun acquired skin molds of regions of their hands and then used shape from shading to construct normal maps from the molds they used texture synthesis to produce a normal map for an entire hand more info shamu by julie tung and alex li julie and alex implemented volumetric photon mapping to produce this beautiful underwater scene of a killer whale more info
