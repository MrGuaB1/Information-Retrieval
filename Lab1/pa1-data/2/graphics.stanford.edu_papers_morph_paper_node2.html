image morphing versus 3d morphing next up previous next geometric versus volumetric up introduction previous introduction image morphing versus 3d morphing image morphing the construction of an image sequence depicting a gradual transition between two images has been extensively investigated 21 2 6 16 for images generated from 3d models there is an alternative to morphing the images themselves 3d morphing generates intermediate 3d models the morphs directly from the given models the morphs are then rendered to produce an image sequence depicting the transformation 3d morphing overcomes the following shortcomings of 2d morphing as applied to images generated from 3d models in 3d morphing creating the morphs is independent of the viewing and lighting parameters hence we can create a morph sequence once and then experiment with various camera angles and lighting conditions during rendering in 2d morphing a new morph must be recomputed every time we wish to alter our viewpoint or the illumination of the 3d model 2d techniques lacking information on the model's spatial configuration are unable to correctly handle changes in illumination and visibility two examples of this type of artifact are i shadows and highlights fail to match shape changes occuring in the morph ii when a feature of the 3d object is not visible in the original 2d image this feature cannot be made to appear during the morph for example when a singing actor needs to open her mouth during a morph pulling her lips apart thickens the lips instead of revealing her teeth last update 11 may 1995 by apostolos toli lerios tolis cs stanford edu
