recording and controlling the 4d light field in a microscope angular control over illumination using our prototype light field illumination system the specimen is a blond human hair scale bar is 100u at top are the patterns displayed on our video projector after passing through a microlens array and the microscope objective ob we obtain the illumination shown in the middle row at bottom are photographs captured by a color camera canon 5d using a 10x 0.45 na objective and no imaging microlens array a brightfield b quasi darkfield note the enhanced visibility of scattering inside the hair fiber c headlamp ie brightfield with a reduced aperture this produces a specular highlight whose undulations arise from scales on the fiber surface d oblique produced by shifting c to the edge of the aperture in this case some of the light reflects from the top surface of the hair fiber producing a specular highlight but some of it continues through the fiber taking on a yellow cast due to selective absorption by the hair pigment eventually this light reflects from the back inside surface of the fiber producing a second highlight white arrow which is colored and at a different angle than the first this accounts for the double highlight characteristic of blond haired people recording and controlling the 4d light field in a microscope marc levoy stanford university zhengyun zhang stanford university ian mcdowall fakespace labs journal of microscopy volume 235 part 2 2009 pp 144 162 cover article abstract by inserting a microlens array at the intermediate image plane of an optical microscope one can record 4d light fields of biological specimens in a single snapshot unlike a conventional photograph light fields permit manipulation of viewpoint and focus after the snapshot has been taken subject to the resolution of the camera and the diffraction limit of the optical system by inserting a second microlens array and video projector into the microscope's illumination path one can control the incident light field falling on the specimen in a similar way in this paper we describe a prototype system we have built that implements these ideas and we demonstrate two applications for it simulating exotic microscope illumination modalities and correcting for optical aberrations digitally the paper pdf file with hi res figures 16mb strongly recommended allows you to zoom into the images pdf file with low res figures 1mb images are fuzzy videos 2 minute video mov file h 264 16 mb showing digital refocusing of illumination and observation in our microscope this video corresponds to figure 11 in the paper 2 minute video mov file h 264 14 mb showing focused illumination passing through a fluorescein filled chamber this video corresponds to figure 19 in the paper additional links our project web page which includes links to more results and movies lfdisplay a software package for real time viewing of microscope light fields the package includes sample light fields and step by step instructions on how to build a light field microscope lfm instructions on how to build a light field illuminator lfi are not included but are available from the authors on request a web page describing other devices we have built to capture light fields note about double highlights in blond haired people the analysis of double highlights in blond haired people mentioned in the figure caption above and in figure 8 of our pdf file is due to a paper by steve marschner 2003 figure 1 in marschner's paper which is a longitudinal cross section of a hair fiber shows a second yellow highlight that is displaced from the first white highlight axially ie along the axis of the hair fiber figure 9 in his paper which is an axial cross section of a hair fiber also shows a second highlight in this case displaced from the first highlight laterally ie perpendicular to the axis of the fiber in the figure above we point out a highlight that is laterally displaced however only a highlight that is axially displaced would lead to a visible double highlight on the head of a blond person in particular in an area where the hair fibers are predominately vertical with respect to the ground ie on the side of a person's head and the lighting is overhead this axial displacment will produce two horizontal bands of reflected light a white one below and a yellow one above assuming white illumination the lateral displacement of highlights pointed out in our figure although arising from a similar geometry to the axial displacement would have no noticeable visual effect thus the caption of our figure is strictly correct but a bit misleading references 1 marschner sr jensen hw cammarano m worley s & hanrahan p 2003 light scattering from human hair fibers acm transactions on graphics proc siggraph 22 3 780 791 copyright 2009 by marc levoy last update june 6 2010 06 34 57 pm
