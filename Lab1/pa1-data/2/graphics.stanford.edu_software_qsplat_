qsplat the qsplat multiresolution point rendering system overview qsplat is a program for displaying large geometric models in real time it was originally designed during the course of the digital michelangelo project to render the hundred million polygon models we were producing it features fast startup and progressive loading real time interactive display with a user selectable frame rate refinement to a high quality rendering when idle point based multiresolution representation with splat rendering level of detail control and hierarchical visibility culling compact representation 6 bytes per input point including normals 9 bytes including color fast preprocessing qsplat is available for research and commercial use free of charge as described at the bottom of this web page screen captures here is a sequence of images showing qsplat renderings of a model of michelangelo's st matthew at left is the model as it would appear during interactive manipulation at right is the model in its highest quality refined version click on the images to bring up full resolution versions 130712 splats 132 ms 259975 splats 215 ms 1017149 splats 722 ms 14835967 splats 8308 ms papers for a more detailed description of qsplat please see qsplat a multiresolution point rendering system for large meshes presented at siggraph 2000 a network streaming version of qsplat is described in streaming qsplat a viewer for networked visualization of large dense models presented at the 2001 symposium on interactive 3d graphics talks slides from the qsplat talk at siggraph 2000 are here slides from the streaming qsplat talk at i3d 2001 are here code qsplat source code and binaries are available here for academic and research use only models a few models in qs format are available here translation this page translated into belorussian by patric conrad people qsplat was written by szymon rusinkiewicz marc levoy provided many useful suggestions and coauthored the paper gary king ported the software to windows and contributed many features including the tile based software renderer qsplat also benefitted from conversations with dave koller jonathan shade matt ginzton kari pulli lucas pereira and james davis the digital michelangelo project was sponsored by stanford university interval research corporation and the paul allen foundation for the arts similar systems qsplat has inspired others to write streaming point based display systems for 3d models one such system which includes a nice gallery of archaeological models is octopus by archaeoptics ltd also check out scanview our client server system for remote visualization of 3d models distribution notice copyright 2000 2001 szymon rusinkiewicz all rights reserved during the period 1995 2007 this software was covered by the stanford computer graphics laboratory's custom written general software license this license is royalty free nonexclusive and nontransferable click here to view its terms and conditions in modification of these terms and conditions users were permitted to distribute or sell derivatives of this software without accounting to stanford or the developers and without payment of royalties to stanford or the developers however title and copyright to the software and documentation remained with stanford and users were required to acknowledge the contribution of stanford in any derivatives as detailed in the license for downloads beginning on august 23 2007 this software is covered by a new general software license which is based on the bsd license the images of michelangelo's statues that appear on this web page are the property of the digital michelangelo project and the soprintendenza ai beni artistici e storici per le province di firenze pistoia e prato they may not be copied downloaded and stored forwarded or reproduced in any form including electronic forms such as email or the web by any persons regardless of purpose without express written permission from the project director marc levoy any commerical use also requires written permission from the soprintendenza smr cs stanford edu http graphics stanford edu software qsplat
