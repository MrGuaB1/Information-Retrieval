dti query cinch pdb format dti query 1.1 cinch 1.0 beta pdb format this document describes the binary format of pdb files pathway database files for use with both cinch and dti query note that all values are stored in little endian format regardless of the endianness of the machine used to compute the pathways integers are 4 bytes characters are 1 byte each doubles and longs are 8 bytes pdb header size in bytes integer pdb header follows 4x4 transformation matrix which is used to transform from voxel space to scanner space or some other space 16 doubles stored in row major order same as vtk number of pathway statistics integer for each statistic currently unused integer is this statistic stored per point or just as an aggregate per path integer 0 false 1 true currently unused integer name of the statistic char 255 currently unused char 255 unique id an integer that uniquely identifies this statistic across files integer number of algorithms integer for each algorithm algorithm name char 255 comments about the algorithm char 255 unique id an integer that uniquely identifies this algorithm across files integer version number integer dtiquery 1.1 1 this field did not exist prior to dtiquery 1.1 pdb header ends number of pathways integer for each pathway header size integer pathway header follows number of points integer algorithm id integer seed point index integer currently unused by dti query for each statistic precomputed statistical value double pathway header ends for each point position of the point in 0 indexed voxel space 3 doubles for each statistic if the statistic is also computed per point see statistics header second field for each point statistical value for this point double for each pathway byte offset of pathway header long end of file questions problems e mail us
