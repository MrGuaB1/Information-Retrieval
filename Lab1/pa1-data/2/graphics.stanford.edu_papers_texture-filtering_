synthetic texturing using digital filters synthetic texturing using digital filters eliot feibush marc levoy robert cook proc siggraph 1980 abstract aliasing artifacts are eliminated from computer generated images of textured polygons by equivalently filtering both the texture and the edges of the polygons different filters can be easily compared because the weighting functions that define the shape of the filters are pre computed and stored in lookup tables a polygon subdivision algorithm removes the hidden surfaces so that the polygons are rendered sequentially to minimize accessing the texture definition files an implementation of the texture rendering procedure is described additional information available optical scan of paper from acm digital library pdf file 3.1 mb link to acm digital library web page on this paper with ocr ed reference list copyright 2004 by marc levoy
