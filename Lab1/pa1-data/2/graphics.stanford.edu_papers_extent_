maintaining the extent of a moving point set maintaining the extent of a moving point set reference maintaining the extent of a moving point set with pankaj k agarwal leonidas j guibas and john hershberger 5th workshop on algorithms and data structures wads 97 august 1997 abstract let s be a set of n moving points in the plane we give new efficient and compact kinetic data structures for maintaining the diameter width and smallest area or perimeter bounding rectangle of the points when the points in s move with pseudo algebraic motions these structures process o n 2 epsilon events we also give constructions showing that omega n 2 combinatorial changes are possible in these extent functions even when the points move on straight lines with constant velocities we give a similar construction and upper bound for the convex hull improving known results additional information postscript of the full paper 387k return to other recent papers from stanford last modified january 22 1998 eric veach
