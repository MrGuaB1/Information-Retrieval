about the isoc about the isoc launched into low earth orbit on june 11 2008 the gamma ray large area space telescope glast was renamed the fermi gamma ray space telescope fgst on august 26 2008 the fgst observatory has two instruments onboard the large area telescope lat and the gamma ray burst monitor gbm responsible for maximizing the lat's science performance the isoc is organized into three groups flight operations science operations science analysis systems key functions command planning generating and validating commands and command sequences monitoring the lat's health and safety maintaining and modifying flight software and the lat testbed verifying and optimizing lat performance processing and archiving level 1 and level 2 data maintaining and optimizing the software that produces science data products distributing science data products and instrument analysis tools to the lat collaboration and the glast science support center gssc lat data flow the isoc receives level 0 raw data and real time housekeeping data from the missions operations center moc after processing this data the isoc then delivers level 1 data ie data in ft1 format that is ready for scientific analysis plus the spacecraft's level 2 pointing and livetime history data in standard ft2 format as well as specialized instrument analysis tools to the lat collaboration and to the glast science support center gssc in addition all intermediate pipeline products are delivered to the lat collaboration the isoc also creates new calibration files as needed and prepares observation schedules corresponding instrument uploads and commands are delivered to both the gssc and the moc and schedules are delivered to the gssc refined alerts are delivered to the gamma ray burst grb coordinates network gcn also see the glast lat isoc poster isoc data flow
