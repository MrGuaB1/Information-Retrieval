the round table is named after king arthur's fabled congregation of knights given the shape of the table it has no head e page 1 the round table is named after king arthur's fabled congregation of knights given the shape of the table it has no head everyone has an equal voice the role of the moderator is to ensure that each participant is invited to voice their opinion or ask probing questions about the topic at hand for round tables 1 through 5 probes of dark energy we have suggested four questions copied below the moderator should feel free to raise these questions in any order the role of the scribe is to take notes on the discussion as well as participate in the discussion and then to synthesize the main points during the break and give an informal seven minute summary to the entire workshop after the break the scribe and the moderator may want to work together on preparing the synthesis note that each topic is discussed by two non overlapping groups of participants therefore we will hear from two independent scribes on each topic which will seed broader discussion scribes should not consult with each other before giving report each round table will be attended by 8 to 10 participants we have deliberately assigned a mix of expert and non expert participants to each round table we are hoping the non experts will challenge the experts on some of their underlying assumptions sometimes it is the non expert questions that are the most probing or the non expert scribe who gives the most refreshing summary
