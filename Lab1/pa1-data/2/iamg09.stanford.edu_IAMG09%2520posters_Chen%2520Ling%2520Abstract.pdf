application of kalman fliter in geochemistry elements noise reduction chen ling information management institution chengdu uni page 1 application of kalman fliter in geochemistry elements noise reduction chen ling information management institution chengdu university of technology the noise in the survey data for geochemistry elements affects the veracity of geochemistry anomaly demarcation in the paper kalman filter is applied to reduce noise in the geochemistry survey data and geochemistry anomaly is then determined by applying kalman filter in the treatment of survey data from 1 200000 hydrographic deposits in the northern section of three river sanjiang region in southwestern china we validated the practicability and reliability of kalman fliter in the noise reduction for geochemistry data by further analyzing the geochemistry anomaly with noise reduced data in the southern side of the northern section of three river sanjiang region we found a large size cu anomaly area which is the first finding in the nu river area in the northern part of three river region
