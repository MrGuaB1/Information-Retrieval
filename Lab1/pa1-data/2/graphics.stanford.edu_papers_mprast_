data parallel rasterization of micropolygons with defocus and motion blur data parallel rasterization of micropolygons with defocus and motion blur kayvon fatahalian edward luong solomon boulos kurt akeley william r mark pat hanrahan presented at high performance graphics 2009 abstract current gpus rasterize micropolygons polygons approximately one pixel in size inefficiently we design and analyze the costs of three alternative data parallel algorithms for rasterizing micropolygon workloads for the real time domain first we demonstrate that efficient micropolygon rasterization requires parallelism across many polygons not just within a single polygon second we produce a data parallel implementation of an existing stochastic rasterization algorithm by pixar which is able to produce motion blur and depth of field effects third we provide an algorithm that leverages interleaved sampling for motion blur and camera defocus this algorithm outperforms pixar's algorithm when rendering objects undergoing moderate defocus or high motion and has the added benefit of predictable performance paper pdf 8.2 mb video 50 mb posted 6 8 2009
