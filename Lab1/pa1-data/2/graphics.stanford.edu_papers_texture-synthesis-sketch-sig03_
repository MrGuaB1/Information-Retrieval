texture synthesis from multiple sources texture synthesis from multiple sources li yi wei in siggraph 2003 sketch and applications abstract recent advances in texture synthesis have made it possible to synthesize textures based on examples however most of these algorithms can take only a single texture as the input and output a similar homogeneous texture this is insufficient for textures that have progressively variant patterns or combined visual characteristics from several different sources we present a new algorithm for synthesizing textures from multiple sources we demonstrate two specializations of our algorithm that are particularly useful generating texture mixtures from different inputs and synthesizing solid textures from multiple 2d views available information one page summary in pdf format as appeared in conference abstracts and applications the talk slides in power point format work in progress more details about this work can be found in chapter 7 of my ph d thesis historical notes this sketch presents my old work in chapter 7 of my thesis i never formally published it since at that time circa 2001 i was busy with my graduation wedding job hunting and i didn t think the results are good enough to warrant any siginificant publication nor did my advisor however later on i read and reviewed quite a few papers by others on similar topics so i think it is probably worthwhile to make my little discovery a bit more well known so that at least people won t duplicate my efforts it is also interesting to compare my work with the siggraph 2003 paper synthesis of progressively variant textures on arbitrary surfaces by people at microsoft research asia liyiwei graphics stanford edu
