real time 3d model acquisition real time 3d model acquisition szymon rusinkiewicz olaf hall holt marc levoy presented at siggraph 2002 abstract the digitization of the 3d shape of real objects is a rapidly expanding field with applications in entertainment design and archaeology we propose a new 3d model acquisition system that permits the user to rotate an object by hand and see a continuously updated model as the object is scanned this tight feedback loop allows the user to find and fill holes in the model in real time and determine when the object has been completely covered our system is based on a 60 hz structured light rangefinder a real time variant of icp iterative closest points for alignment and point based merging and rendering algorithms we demonstrate the ability of our prototype to scan objects faster and with greater ease than conventional model acquisition pipelines the siggraph paper full paper as pdf one page abstract and figure 1 as pdf two page abstract and figure 1 as pdf a 5 minute video describing the system avi file 640 x 480 pixels 19mb realvideo stream 640 x 480 pixels 1536 kbs realvideo stream 320 x 240 56 904 kbs siggraph 2002 talk talk as ppt embedded video clip sig02_begin_m avi embedded video clip sig02_recap avi embedded video clip turtle2 avi smr cs princeton edu
