a distributed graphics system for large tiled displays a distributed graphics system for large tiled displays greg humphreys and pat hanrahan stanford university appears in the proceedings of ieee visualization 99 abstract recent interest in large displays has led to renewed development of tiled displays which are comprised of several individual displays arranged in an array and used as one large logical display stanford's interactive mural is an example of such a display using an overlapping four by two array of projectors that back project onto a diffuse screen to form a 6 by 2 display area with a resolution of over 60 dpi writing software to make effective use of the large display space is a challenge because normal window system interaction metaphors break down one promising approach is to switch to immersive applications another approach the one we are investigating is to emulate office conference room or studio environments which use the space to display a collection of visual material to support group activities in this paper we describe a virtual graphics system that is designed to support multiple simultaneous rendering streams from both local and remote sites the system abstracts the physical number of computers graphics subsystems and projectors used to create the display we provide performance measurements to show that the system scales well and thus supports a variety of different hardware configurations the system is also interesting because it uses transparent layers instead of windows to manage the screen paper paper in pdf 150k and compressed postscript 200k color plate in pdf 2mb and compressed postscript 1.7 mb greg humphreys
