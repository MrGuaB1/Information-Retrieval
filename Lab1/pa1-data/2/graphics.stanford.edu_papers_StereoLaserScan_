a scalable multi user laser input system a laser range scanner designed for minimum calibration complexity james davis xing chen abstract laser range scanners are a popular method for acquiring three dimensional geometry due to their accuracy and robustness maximizing scanner accuracy while minimizing engineering costs is a key challenge to future scanner designs engineering costs arise from both expensive components and difficult calibration requirements we propose a new range scanner design specifically chosen to minimize calibration complexity and cost this design eliminates all actuated components from the calibrated geometry since it is difficult to ensure absolute repeatability of moving parts a design with only statically arranged components can dramatically reduce the costs associated with calibration paper 3dim 2001 paper pdf 3.1 mb ps 4.6 mb 3dim 2001 presentation powerpoint 5.3 mb pdf 2.4 mb html selected figures a cross section of recovered geometry on a target with known steps ranging in depth from 4mm to 1mm left three meshes scanned from different viewpoints using our scanner right the meshes have been aligned into a single coordinate system a a volumetric method was used to merge twenty two scans into a single mesh the single mesh is shown from three viewpoints b a hole filling technique was used to fill holes remaining in areas not observed in the scanning process
