glast gui software installer glast gui installer this is a gui front end to navid's installer the installed should now work on windows linux or macosx unlike the command line installer it does not require direct access to mysql and thus should work even if the mysql port is blocked at your local firewall requirements you need to have java installed prior to using the installer if you are a vrvs user you should already have java installed if not you can download java from java com linux users may need to configure their browser to open jnlp files with the javaws application installed as part of java launch the installer to launch the installer just click on the link below launch installer now screenshots in case it doesn t work for you this is what it should look like implementation notes the installer does not talk directly to the database instead it gets its info from a web server where a simple servlet queries the database and returns results as plain text to the installer this demo illustrates how the web interface works the web interface isolates the client from the database details and thus only the single web servlet needs to be updated if the database organization changes the servlet could also easily be replaced by a cgi bin script if this was simpler to maintain of course the gui may need to be updated to support additional features but this should also be easy to do
