cs348b final project cs348b project proposal andreas edlund and tim chao goal in our project we intend to explore techniques in realistically rendering surfaces with fine geometric structures such as grass and fur to motivate this we will try to render a realistic scene of a teddy bear sitting in short grass in an outdoor scene previous work we will use as reference kajiya and kay's paper rendering fur with three dimensional textures in which texels are used to simulate the reflection of light through fur we hope to apply similar volumetric techniques to our rendering of the grass but the coarse nature of grass may offer a different challenge reeves and blau's approximate and probabilistic algorithms for shading and rendering structured particles presents another method that might be explored in rendering grass key challenges rendering with three dimensional textures we will explore using kajiya and kay's techniques of texel shading in lrt this can be applied towards our rendering of fur generating appropriate textures to simulate grass and fur possible extensions realistic wind effects applied to fur and grass use subsurface scattering to accurately render leaves in the grass try using actual geometry to model blades of grass
