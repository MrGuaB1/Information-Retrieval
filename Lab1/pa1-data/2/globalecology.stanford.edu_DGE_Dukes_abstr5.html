dukes and hungate ecosystems abstract elevated co 2 and litter decomposition in california annual grasslands which mechanisms matter dukes js hungate ba 2001 ecosystems in press to date most research that has examined the effect of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration co 2 on litter decomposition has focused on changes in the leaf litter quality of individual species results from california grasslands indicate that other co 2 responses may have greater consequences for decomposition rates for instance co 2 driven changes in either species dominance or patterns of biomass allocation would alter both the quality and the position of grassland litter here we review results from studies in california grasslands to identify mechanisms that will affect grassland litter decomposition we use a simple calculation that integrates the results of two studies to identify three mechanisms that have the potential to substantially alter decomposition rates as the atmospheric co 2 rises
