visualizing application behavior on superscalar processors visualizing application behavior on superscalar processors chris stolte robert bosch pat hanrahan and mendel rosenblum computer science department stanford university appears in information visualization 99 abstract the advent of superscalar processors with out of order execution makes it increasingly difficult to determine how well an application is utilizing the processor and how to adapt the application to improve its performance in this paper we describe a visualization system for the analysis of application behavior on superscalar processors our system provides an overview plus detail display of the application's execution a timeline view of pipeline performance data shows the overall utilization of the pipeline indicating regions of poor instruction throughput this information is displayed using multiple time scales enabling the user to drill down from a high level application overview to a focus region of hundreds of cycles this region of interest is displayed in detail using an animated cycle by cycle view of the execution this view shows how instructions are reordered and executed and how functional units are being utilized additional context views correlate instructions in this detailed view with the relevant source code for the application this allows the user to discover the root cause of the poor pipeline utilization and make changes to the application to improve its performance this visualization system can be easily configured to display a variety of processor models and configurations we demonstrate it for both the mxs and mmix processor models pdf 6.8 mb postscript with lo res figures 1.9 mb or postscript with hi res figures 1.9 mb gzipped 18 mb uncompressed robert bosch last modified mon jan 24 17 16 03 pst 2000
