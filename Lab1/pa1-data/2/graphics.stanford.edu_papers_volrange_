a volumetric method for building complex models from range images a volumetric method for building complex models from range images brian curless and marc levoy proc siggraph 96 abstract a number of techniques have been developed for reconstructing surfaces by integrating groups of aligned range images a desirable set of properties for such algorithms includes incremental updating representation of directional uncertainty the ability to fill gaps in the reconstruction and robustness in the presence of outliers prior algorithms possess subsets of these properties in this paper we present a volumetric method for integrating range images that possesses all of these properties our volumetric representation consists of a cumulative weighted signed distance function working with one range image at a time we first scan convert it to a distance function then combine this with the data already acquired using a simple additive scheme to achieve space efficiency we employ a run length encoding of the volume to achieve time efficiency we resample the range image to align with the voxel grid and traverse the range and voxel scanlines synchronously we generate the final manifold by extracting an isosurface from the volumetric grid we show that under certain assumptions this isosurface is optimal in the least squares sense to fill gaps in the model we tessellate over the boundaries between regions seen to be empty and regions never observed using this method we are able to integrate a large number of range images as many as 70 yielding seamless high detail models of up to 2.6 million triangles additional information available note the color figures are included here in both postscript format and jpeg image format if you wish to view the figures on your monitor we recommend the jpeg images if you wish to print the figures on a high quality color printer then use the postscript files the postscript files have been gamma corrected to be brighter for printing we do not recommend viewing the hi res postscript color figure files with a postscript viewer as they are large can be slow to display and many viewers dither the images to give low quality results unfortunately many web browsers automatically load these files and either display them with a postscript viewer or load the postscript text into the browser consult your web browser documentation for details on how to download a file without viewing it when using the netscape navigator for example hold down the shift key option key on macintosh while clicking on the desired link pdf version of the paper 678 kb slides from the talk given at siggraph 96 html version of the paper single file html version of the paper broken up by sections postscript paper without color figures 113kb compressed 360kb uncompressed postscript paper with low resolution color figures 0.8 mb compressed 5.5 mb uncompressed jpeg image of figure 4 91kb signed distance and weight functions in two dimensions jpeg image of figure 6 85kb volumetric grid with space carving and hole filling jpeg image of figure 9 64kb merging range images of a drill bit jpeg image of figure 11 185kb reconstruction of a dragon jpeg image of figure 12 200kb reconstruction of the happy buddha postscript hi res figures 4 6 and 9 save to disk 0.5 mb compressed 15mb uncompressed functions in 2d space carving and hole filling drill bit postscript hi res figure 11 save to disk 1.3 mb compressed 11mb uncompressed reconstruction of a dragon postscript hi res figure 12 save to disk 1.8 mb compressed 9.5 mb uncompressed reconstruction of the happy buddha demos software and data renderings movies and 3d fax of happy buddha vrippack volumetric range image processing package the stanford 3d scanning repository slides from our siggraph 96 talk curless cs stanford edu
