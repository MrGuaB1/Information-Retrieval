image replacement through texture synthesis image replacement through texture synthesis homan igehy and lucas pereira stanford university appears in the proceedings of the 1997 ieee international conference on image processing abstract photographs and images often have regions which are in some sense flawed often there may be a stain or an undesired feature covering a significant portion of the image and an algorithm that can fix the image is desired we propose a technique based on heeger and bergen's texture synthesis algorithm by integrating a composition step into the aforementioned algorithm one portion of the image can be substituted with a synthetic texture derived from another portion of the image the goal of this synthetic texture is to create a plausible patch without visible seams or repetitive features we compare this technique which works on areas that are stochastic in nature with other variations of image replacement which utilize a combination of image composition and texture synthesis additional information available this paper has the following copyright copyright 1997 ieee published in the 1997 international conference on image processing icip 97 scheduled for october 26 29 1997 in santa barbara ca personal use of this material is permitted however permission to reprint republish this material for advertising or promotional purposes or for creating new collective works for resale or redistribution to servers or lists or to reuse any copyrighted component of this work in other works must be obtained from the ieee contact manager copyrights and permissions ieee service center 445 hoes lane po box 1331 piscataway nj 08855 1331 usa telephone intl 908 562 3966 paper acrobat pdf format 325 kb postscript format 4.75 mb pictures donkey cave air grass river homan graphics stanford edu
