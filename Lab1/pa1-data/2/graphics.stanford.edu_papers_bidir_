bidirectional estimators for light transport image a table bidirectional estimators for light transport reference eric veach and leonidas j guibas eurographics rendering workshop 1994 proceedings darmstadt germany june 1994 pp 147 162 also appears in photorealistic rendering techniques springer verlag new york 1995 images too dark try the gamma corrected pages there is also more information on gamma correction abstract most of the research on the global illumination problem in computer graphics has been concentrated on finite element radiosity techniques monte carlo methods are an intriguing alternative which are attractive for their ability to handle very general scene descriptions without the need for meshing in this paper we study techniques for reducing the sampling noise inherent in pure monte carlo approaches to global illumination every light energy transport path from a light source to the eye can be generated in a number of different ways according to how we partition the path into an initial portion traced from a light source and a final portion traced from the eye each partitioning gives us a different unbiased estimator but some partitionings give estimators with much lower variance than others we give examples of this phenomenon and describe its significance we also present work in progress on the problem of combining these multiple estimators to achieve near optimal variance with the goal of producing images with less noise for a given number of samples additional information postscript of paper minus images 516k postscript of full paper with low resolution grayscale images 2100k figure 3 a plate 1 computed starting from the lights jpeg 185k figure 3 b plate 2 standard monte carlo path tracing jpeg 354k figure 4 af components according to path length jpeg 186k if the images are too dark try the gamma corrected pages all jpeg images were compressed using a quality setting of 90 last modified may 22 1995 eric veach
