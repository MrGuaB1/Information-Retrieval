special topics in group theory page 1 department colloquium friday december 2 note different day 4 15pm building 380 room 380 w nantel bergeron york university combinatorial hopf algebras categorification and representation theory abstract symmetric functions in countably many variables form a typical combinatorial hopf algebra the basis of schur functions encodes the representation theory of the symmetric groups where the multiplication and the comultiplication correspond to induction and restriction as such schur functions multiply and comultiply very nicely the structure constants are known as the littlewood richardson coefficients and are non negative for many of us a combinatorial hopf algebra is a graded hopf algebra with a special basis preferably indexed by combinatorial objects such that the structure constants are nonnegative because of its combinatorial nature it is often more suitable to lift the hopf algebra structure to a hopf monoid in the category of species the multiplication and comultiplication are then explained more combinatorially and easier to work with i will give a more recent example of these concepts where 1 the symmetric functions in non commutative variables also have a natural combinatorial hopf algebra structure and are understood via the supercharacter theory of unipotent upper triangular matrices over a finite field 2 this hopf structure can be lifted to a hopf monoid of set partitions over a total order 3 new results will be obtained from this procedure this is joint work with nat thiem and marcelo aguiar
