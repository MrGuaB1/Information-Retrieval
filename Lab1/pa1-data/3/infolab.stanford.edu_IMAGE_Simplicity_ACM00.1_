simplicity paper irm integrated region matching for image retrieval jia li james z wang gio wiederhold stanford university stanford ca 94305 abstract content based image retrieval using region segmentation has been an active research area we present irm integrated region matching a novel similarity measure for region based image similarity comparison the targeted image retrieval systems represent an image by a set of regions roughly corresponding to objects which are characterized by features reflecting color texture shape and location properties the irm measure for evaluating overall similarity between images incorporates properties of all the regions in the images by a region matching scheme compared with retrieval based on individual regions the overall similarity approach reduces the influence of inaccurate segmentation helps to clarify the semantics of a particular region and enables a simple querying interface for region based image retrieval systems the irm has been implemented as a part of our experimental simplicity image retrieval system the application to a database of about 200000 general purpose images shows exceptional robustness to image alterations such as intensity variation sharpness variation color distortions shape distortions cropping shifting and rotation compared with several existing systems our system in general achieves more accurate retrieval at higher speed full paper in color pdf 5mb html on line demo citation jia li james z wang and gio wiederhold irm integrated region matching for image retrieval proc acm multimedia pp 147 156 los angeles ca acm october 2000 copyright 2000 acm personal use of this material is permitted however permission to reprint republish this material for advertising or promotional purposes or for creating new collective works for resale or redistribution to servers or lists or to reuse any copyrighted component of this work in other works must be obtained from the acm last modified july 10 2000 2000
