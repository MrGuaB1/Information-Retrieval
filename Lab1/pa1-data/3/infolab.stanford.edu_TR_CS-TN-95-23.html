report number cs tn 95 23 institution stanford university department of computer science title dynamic maintenance of kinematic structures author halperin dan author latombe jean claude author motwani rajeev date august 1995 abstract we study the following dynamic data structure problem given a collection of rigid bodies moving in three dimensional space and hinged together in a kinematic structure our goal is to maintain a data structure that describes certain geometric features of these bodies and efficiently update it as the bodies move this data structure problem seems to be fundamental and it comes up in a variety of applications such as conformational search in molecular biology simulation of hyper redundant robots collision detection and computer animation in this note we present preliminary results on a few variants of the problem ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tn 95 23 cs tn 95 23 pdf
