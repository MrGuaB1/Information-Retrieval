energy stanford engineering intranet energy 00 00 00 00 addressing the uncertain future of energy recent increases in energy prices provide a graphic reminder of the importance of energy to our economy and our quality of life improved efficiency of energy systems and development of sustainable and low carbon emission energy generation processes are essential for the long term health of the environment most of our endeavors economic social and societal are fueled by a near transparent infrastructure of relatively inexpensive highly reliable and easily accessible energy however the traditional model one based on plentiful inexpensive fossil fuels will not carry us past the middle of the century in the mechanical engineering department at stanford university we recognize that developing sustainable energy systems requires efforts in multiple disciplines and by large teams of faculty and students it will require that we identify attractive fuel sources and that we develop the technologies required to use those sources in efficient environmentally benign ways many me faculty are focussed on advanced energy carrier technologies and energy conversion devices such as fuel cells hydrogen storage systems hybrid transportation and power systems as well as smart ways of accomplishing chemical to work energy conversion energy faculty faculty in the thermosciences and flow physics & computational engineering groups have a long tradition of experimental and simulation leadership for energy systems these efforts include a world leading set of laboratory facilities for the study of reacting flows and combustion processes including a massive engine laboratory and shock tube facility our laboratories also include facilities for the study of clean coal energy conversion thermoelectric energy conversion for waste heat recovery as well as fuel cell devices and systems our faculty are at the forefront of computational engineering of advanced energy conversion processes and have lead the way in the use of parallel computing and the development of strategies for handling multi physics energy transport and conversion phenomena these activities as a group provide compelling simulations and data for systems ranging from fuel cells thermoelectrics clean coal and highly efficient gas turbine engines in the design and mechanics & computation groups faculty are studying the basic materials physics for novel energy conversion systems including solid oxide and pem fuel cells multi disciplinary solutions are required these developments will take place both within the traditional boundaries of mechanical engineering and at the boundaries where me intersects with material science eg membranes electrical engineering eg sensors actuators and controls biology eg biosynthesis of fuels and other fields our current highly diverse approach to research positions us well to contribute to this rapidly changing landscape me department groups biomechanical engineering design flow physics and computational engineering mechanics and computation thermosciences rk hanson research group the hanson research group has been actively involved in research at the high temperature gasdynamics laboratory at stanford university for over 25 years resulting in over 75 ph ds being awarded the group has published over 400 papers contributing to advances in shock wave physics and chemistry laser spectroscopy advanced optical diagnostics and sensors chemical kinetics combustion science and advanced propulsion visit hanson lab prof hanson's faculty profile stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni themes that define us groups & programs faculty & research faculty directory affiliate programs faculty lookup by topic faculty open positions laboratories research centers ahpcrc cdr cits ctr research profiles research projects admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
