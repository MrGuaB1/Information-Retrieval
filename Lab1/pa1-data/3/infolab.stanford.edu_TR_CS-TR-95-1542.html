report number cs tr 95 1542 institution stanford university department of computer science title parallel genetic programming on a network of transputers author koza john r author andre david date january 1995 abstract this report describes the parallel implementation of genetic programming in the c programming language using a pc 486 type computer running windows acting as a host and a network of transputers acting as processing nodes using this approach researchers of genetic algorithms and genetic programming can acquire computing power that is intermediate between the power of currently available workstations and that of supercomputers at a cost that is intermediate between the two a comparison is made of the computational effort required to solve the problem of symbolic regression of the boolean even 5 parity function with different migration rates genetic programming required the least computational effort with an 8 migration rate moreover this computational effort was less than that required for solving the problem with a serial computer and a panmictic population of the same size that is apart from the nearly linear speed up in executing a fixed amount of code inherent in the parallel implementation of genetic programming parallelization delivered more than linear speed up in solving the problem using genetic programming ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 95 1542 cs tr 95 1542 pdf
