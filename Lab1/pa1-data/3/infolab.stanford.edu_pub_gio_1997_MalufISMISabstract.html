abstraction of representation for interoperation abstraction of representation for interoperation maluf david a and wiederhold gio tenth international symposium on methodologies for intelligent systems ismis in ras and skowron artificial inelligence lecture notes in computer science 1415 springer verlag pp 441 455 october 1997 paper ps when combining data from distinct sources there is a need to share meta data and other knowledge about various sourcer domains due to semantic inconsistencies problems arise when combining knowledge across domains and the knowledge is simply merged also knowledge that is irrelevant to the task of interoperation will be included making the result unnecessarily complex an algebra over ontologies has been proposed to support disciplined manipulation of domain knowledge resources however if one tries to interoperte directly with the knowledge bases semantic problems arise due to heterogenuity of representations this heterogenuity problem can be eliminated by using an intermediate model that controls the knowledge translation from a source knowledge base the intermediate model we have developed is based on the concept of abstract knowledge representation and has two components a modeling behavior which separates the knowledge from its implementation and a performative behavior which establishes context abstraction rules over the knowledge
