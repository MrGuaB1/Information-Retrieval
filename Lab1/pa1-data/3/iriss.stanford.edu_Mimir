the mimir project institute for research in the social sciences stanford university institute for research in the social sciences the mimir project the mimir project what drives the dynamics of science governments companies and academic organizations regularly try to speed scientific progress in key areas by forming interdisciplinary centers do these innovations or recombinations accelerate research or decelerate it by moving scientists away from their disciplinary contexts are interdisciplinary confluences already underway when these centers are created or do they induce new synergies among researchers what kinds of organizational models most effectively promote interdisciplinary research the research team has embarked on a longitudinal study of how scientific ideas scholarly networks and their institutional contexts influence one another this project will take advantage of special access to data on stanford university and its $4.3 billion dollar funding drive commenced in 1998 which attempts to bolster interdisciplinary centers and alter university research so it addresses real world problems this data will be set against the backdrop of large scale public data sources the project aims to develop evidence based tools and visualizations that reveal whether and how the form and content of intellectual work is changing in response to these major initiatives our interdisciplinary team will apply new computational techniques to study the spread of ideas and methods across disciplines to contrast the success of virtual and ephemeral versus formal and physical organizations and to understand the complex behavior of a large scale intellectual enterprise and what attributes are important for successful innovation for details on this project including a list of researchers and current findings visit the stanford natural language processing group page navigation iriss home centers and programs tools for researchers research people invest in iriss contact leland stanford jr university all rights reserved stanford ca 94305
