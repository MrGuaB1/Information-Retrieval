department of mechanical engineering research profiles stanford engineering intranet printable pdf tom bowman fuels of the future as concern over greenhouse gas emissions increases and as availability of conventional hydrocarbon resources decreases there will be a transition to new fuels derived from new sources the chemical and physical characteristics of these future fuels will differ from those commonly used today to assist in the production and use of these fuels fundamental studies of the combustion chemistry of these new fuel structures are needed in order to optimize fuels for end use and to develop reduced reaction mechanisms for use in the cfd codes employed to design combustion equipment the mechanical engineering department is engaged in a comprehensive experimental and computational research program to obtain the required information stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni themes that define us groups & programs faculty & research faculty directory affiliate programs faculty lookup by topic faculty open positions laboratories research centers ahpcrc cdr cits ctr research profiles research projects admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
