report number cs tr 84 1014 institution stanford university department of computer science title a p complete problem and approximations to it author anderson richard author mayr ernst w date september 1984 abstract the p complete problem that we will consider is the high degree subgraph problem this problem is given a graph g v e and an integer k find the maximum induced subgraph of g that has all nodes of degree at least k after showing that this problem is p complete we will discuss two approaches to finding approximate solutions to it in nc we will give a variant of the problem that is also p complete that can be approximated to within a factor of c in nc for any c 1 2 but cannot be approximated by a factor of better than 1 2 unless p nc we will also give an algorithm that finds a subgraph with moderately high minimum degree this algorithm exhibits an interesting relationship between its performance and the time it takes ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 84 1014 cs tr 84 1014 pdf
