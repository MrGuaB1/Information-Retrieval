stanford algebraic geometry seminar page 1 stanford algebraic geometry seminar on the categorification of donaldson thomas invariants kai behrend university of british columbia donaldson thomas invariants have attracted much attention lately because of their connec tion to gromov witten invariants of calabi yau threefolds in earlier work i showed that donaldson thomas invariants are certain weighted euler characteristics of the moduli space of sheaves my goal is now the construction of a cohomology theory which underlies these weighted euler characteristics a toy model for donaldson thomas type moduli spaces is the intersection of two lagrangian submanifolds inside a complex symplectic manifold thus a natural starting point for this program is to construct the required cohomology the ory for such lagrangian intersections if the symplectic manifold is a cotangent bundle the required cohomology theory is not difficult to write down in recent research i was able to show that this construction globalizes ie it depends only on the symplectic structure this gives rise to a kind of virtual de rham type cohomology theory for lagrangian intersections friday february 2 3 15 pm room 383 n http math stanford edu ag s0607
