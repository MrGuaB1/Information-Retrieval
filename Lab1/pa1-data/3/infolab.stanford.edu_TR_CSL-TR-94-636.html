report number csl tr 94 636 institution stanford university department of computer science title mable a technique for efficient machine simulation author davies peter author lacroute philippe author heinlein john author horowitz mark date october 1994 abstract we present a framework for an efficient instruction level machine simulator which can be used with existing software tools to develop and analyze programs for a proposed processor architecture the simulator exploits similarities between the instruction sets of the emulated machine and the host machine to provide fast simulation furthermore existing program development tools on the host machine such as debuggers and profilers can be used without modification on the emulated program running under the simulator the simulator can therefore be used to debug and tune application code for the new processor without building a whole new set of program development tools the technique has applicability to a diverse set of simulation problems we show how the framework has been used to build simulators for a shared memory multiprocessor a superscalar processor with support for speculative execution and a dual issue embedded processor ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 94 636 csl tr 94 636 pdf
