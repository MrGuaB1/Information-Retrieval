web service management system wsms home isn t this the same as resources members papers web service management system wsms with many enterprises moving towards a service oriented architecture web services are becoming a standard method of sharing data and functionality among loosely coupled systems the aim of this project is to build a general purpose web service management system wsms prototype that enables querying multiple web services in a unified and transparent fashion through a sql like interface fig 1 a schematic view of a wsms a wsms consists of three major components metadata component this component deals with registration of new web services and mapping their schemas to the global view exported in the client interface query processing and optimization component the job of this component is to take a user input query and find the optimal query plan ie the most efficient way to process the query by issuing calls to the relevant web services the execution engine then executes this query plan by making actual web service calls and efficiently managing the data exchange between the wsms and the various web services profiling and statistics component this component profiles web services for their response time characteristics and maintains relevant statistics over the web service data these statistics are mainly used by the query optimizer for making its optimization decisions for initial work on our prototype we are focusing particularly on the query processing and optimization component and assuming fairly simplistic metadata and profiling components we have developed novel algorithms for query optimization over web services see our papers stanford infolab free hit counter code this page was last updated on 09 27 2005 by utkarsh srivastava
