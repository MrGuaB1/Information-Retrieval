mechanics and computation optical dissection of worm behavior stanford mechanics and computation home people research teaching seminar schedule faq chris fang yen ph d november 17 2011 optical dissection of worm behavior the nematode c elegans is an attractive model for understanding how neural circuits create behavior this microscopic worm possesses a relatively simple nervous system composed of 302 neurons and is the only animal for which the wiring diagram of synaptic connectivity is known moreover the worm's optical transparency and genetic manipulability enable the monitoring and manipulation of its nervous system in intact animals i will first describe biomechanical and behavioral analyses of the worm's locomotory and feeding behaviors i will then discuss novel optogenetic methods we have developed for dissecting the neural bases of these behaviors retrieved from http mc stanford edu cgi bin index php title optical_dissection_of_worm_behavior&oldid 3525 member login log in page discussion view source history what links here related changes upload file special pages editing instructions
