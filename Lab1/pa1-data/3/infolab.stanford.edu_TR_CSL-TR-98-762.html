report number csl tr 98 762 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title hardware software co design of run time systems author mooney vincent john iii date june 1998 abstract trends in system level design show a clear move towards core based design where processors controllers and other proprietary cores are reused and constitute essential building blocks thus areas such as embedded system design and system on a chip design are changing dramatically requiring new design methodologies and computer aided design cad tools this thesis presents a novel system level scheduling methodology and cad environment the serra run time scheduler synthesis and analysis tool unlike previous approaches to run time scheduling we split our run time scheduler between hardware and software as opposed to placing the scheduler all in one or the other thus given an already partitioned input system specification in an hdl and a software language serra automatically generates a run time scheduler partly in hardware and partly in software for a target architecture of a microprocessor core together with multiple hardware cores or modules a heuristic scheduling algorithm solves for priorities of software tasks executing on a single microprocessor with a custom priority scheduler interrupt service routine and context switch code real time analysis takes into account the split hardware software implementation both of the scheduler and of the tasks the scheduler supports standard requirements of both domains such as relative timing constraints in hardware and semaphores in software a designer who uses the serra cad tool gains the advantage of efficient satisfaction of timing constraints for hardware software systems within a framework that enables different hardware software partitions to be quickly evaluated thus a hardware software partitioning tool could easily sit on top of serra which would generate run time systems for different hardware software partitions chosen for evaluation in addition serra's more efficient design space exploration can improve time to market for a product finally we present two case studies first we show a full analysis synthesis and simulation of a hardware software implementation of a robotics control system for a puma arm second we describe a sample prototype of the split run time scheduler in an actual design a force feedback real time haptic robot for this application the hardware part of the scheduler was implemented on programmable logic communicating with software using a standard communication protocol ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 98 762 csl tr 98 762 pdf
