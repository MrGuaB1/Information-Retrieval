report number cs tn 97 56 institution stanford university department of computer science title approximation algorithms for directed steiner tree problems author charikar moses author chekuri chandra author goel ashish author guha sudipto date march 1997 abstract we obtain the first non trivial approximation algorithms for the steiner tree problem and the generalized steiner tree problem in general directed graphs essentially no approximation algorithms were known for these problems for the directed steiner tree problem we design a family of algorithms which achieve an approximation ratio of o k epsilon in time o kn 1 epsilon for any fixed epsilon 0 where k is the number of terminals to be connected for the directed generalized steiner tree problem we give an algorithm which achieves an approximation ratio of o k 2 3 log 1 3 k where k is the number of pairs to be connected related problems including the group steiner tree problem the node weighted steiner tree problem and several others can be reduced in an approximation preserving fashion to the problems we solve giving the first non trivial approximations to those as well ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tn 97 56 cs tn 97 56 pdf
