name cortical medullary bone mineral storage definition the cortical bone is the outer compact or dense bone and the medullary bone is the inner spongy or cancellous bone structure a thick layer of cortical bone makes up the shaft of the bone and an inner spongy layer contains irregularly shaped spaces lined with crystals of minerals and proteins the medullary shaft is the inner tubular space sometimes called the marrow cavity both ends of long bones the epiphyses have epiphyseal lines that indicate where growth occurred during development the outside of the bone is covered by periosteum and the inner spaces are covered by a thin layer of endostium both of which contain osteoblast and osteoclast cells the cortical bone is a lattice of tube shaped osteons aka haversian systems tightly packed but with blood and lymph channels and nerves traversing them up and down centrally haversian canals and perforating through them horizontally volkmannos canals from the periosteum into the medullary cavity function the strength of the femur comes from the thick cortex and the small flexibility of long bones comes from the twisted bundles of collagen along with mineral components of the bone matrix called osteons inside the cortical bone remodeling occurs rapidly months in the cancellous or spongy bone where the minerals and proteins are stored in thin bridges but it occurs slowly years in the dense cortical bone blood cell formation hematopoiesis occurs in the cancellous bone especially in the ends of the bones the medullary cavity is mainly filled with yellow fat questions questions evaluation for me this frame was difficult ok fun easy too easy copyright c 1997 stanford university all rights reserved for more information please contact creatures summit stanford edu or visit the virtual creatures website
