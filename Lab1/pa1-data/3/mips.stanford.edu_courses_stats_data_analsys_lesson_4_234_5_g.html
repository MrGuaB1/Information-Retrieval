properties of the t distribution as illustrated above the t distribution has many properties which differentiate it from the standard normal or z distribution the distribution shares the bell curve of the z but reflects the variablility that is inherent with smaller sample sizes the shape of the t distribution is dependent on the sample size n the standard deviation is greater than 1 as the sample size n increases the shape of the curve approaches the standard deviation 4 15
