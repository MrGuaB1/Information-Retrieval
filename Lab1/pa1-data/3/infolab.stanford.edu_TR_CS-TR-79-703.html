report number cs tr 79 703 institution stanford university department of computer science title a polynomial time algorithm for solving systems of linear inequalities with two variables per inequality author aspvall bengt author shiloach yossi date january 1979 abstract we present a constructive algorithm for solving systems of linear inequalities li with at most two variables per inequality the algorithm is polynomial in the size of the input the li problem is of importance in complexity theory since it is polynomial time equivalent to linear programming the subclass of li treated in this paper is also of practical interest in mechanical verification systems and we believe that the ideas presented can be extended to the general li problem ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 79 703 cs tr 79 703 pdf
