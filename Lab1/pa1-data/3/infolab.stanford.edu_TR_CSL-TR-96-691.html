report number csl tr 96 691 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title ppp a gate level power simulator a world wide web application author bogliolo alessandro author benini luca author demicheli giovanni author ricco bruno date march 1996 abstract power consumption is an increasingly important constraint for complex ics accurate and efficient power estimations are required at any level of abstraction to steer the design process ppp is a web based integrated environment for synthesis and simulation of low power cmos circuits we describe the simulation engine of ppp and we propose a new paradigm for tool integration the simulation engine of ppp is a gate level simulator that achieves accuracy comparable with electrical simulation while keeping performance competitive with traditional gate level techniques this is done by using advanced symbolic models of the basic library cells that exploit the understanding of the main phenomena involved in power consumption in order to maintain full compatibility with gate level design tools we use verilog xl as simulation platform the accuracy obtained on benchmark circuits is always within 6 from spice also for single gate single pattern power analysis thus providing the local information needed to optimize the design interface and tool integration issues have been addressed using a web based approach the graphical interface of ppp is a dynamically generated tree of interactive html pages that allow the user to access and execute the tool through the internet by using his her own web browser no software installation is required and all the details of data transfer and tool communication are hidden to the user ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 96 691 csl tr 96 691 pdf
