scalable and elastic data management in the cloud amr el abbadi uc santa barbara over the past two decades database and systems researchers have made significant advances in the development of algorithms and techniques to provide data management solutions that carefully balance the three major requirements when dealing with critical data high availability reliability and data consistency however over the past few years the data requirements in terms of data availability and system scalability from internet scale enterprises that provide services and cater to millions of users has been unprecedented cloud computing has emerged as an extremely successful paradigm for deploying internet and web based applications scalability elasticity pay per use pricing and autonomic control of large scale operations are the major reasons for the successful widespread adoption of cloud infrastructures in this talk we analyze the design choices that allowed modern scalable data management systems to achieve orders of magnitude higher levels of scalability compared to traditional databases with this understanding we highlight some design principles for data management systems that can be used to augment transactional databases with new cloud features such as scalability elasticity and autonomy we analyze several state of the art systems and discuss our proposed system g store which provides transactional guarantees on data granules formed on demand while being efficient and scalable
