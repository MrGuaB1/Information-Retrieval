uniform continuity uniform continuity let f be a function on a metric space x we say that f is uniformly continuous if for every varepsilon 0 there is a delta 0 such that if x y delta then f x f y varepsilon this is stronger than continuity since one delta works for all x and y theorem 1 if x is compact then a continuous function on x is uniformly continuous this is called the heine cantor theorem according to wikipedia it is proved in the book but the following proof is slightly different yet another proof uses the notion of sequential compactness proof click to expand collapse let varepsilon 0 be given for every x in x since f is continuous at x there exists a delta_x 0 such that if y x delta_x then f y f x frac varepsilon 2 now x bigcup_ x in x b_ delta_x 2 x since every x in x is contained on one of the balls b_ delta_x 2 x so their union covers x because x is compact this cover has a finite subcover so there exist x_1 cdots x_n such that writing delta_i delta_ x_i we have x b_ delta_1 2 x_1 cup cdots cup b_ delta_n 2 x_n 1 now let delta min left frac delta_1 2 cdots frac delta_n 2 right we will show that if x y delta then f x f y varepsilon this will prove uniform continuity of f suppose that x y delta le delta_i 2 by 1 we have x in b_ delta_i 2 x_i for some i thus x x_i delta_i 2 furthermore y x_i y x x x_i le y x x x_i le frac delta_i 2 frac delta_i 2 delta thus both x and y lie in b_ delta_i x_i and so f x f x_i frac varepsilon 2 f y f x_i frac varepsilon 2 by the triangle inequality we therefore have f x f y le f x f x_i f y f x_i varepsilon here is an extremely useful application of uniform continuity proposition 1 let f x t be a continuous function defined on a b times u where u is an open interval in mathbb r assume that the partial derivative partial f partial t is also continuous on a b times u then frac d dt int_a bf x t dx int_a b frac partial f partial t x t d x proof click to expand collapse let f t int_a bf x t dx and let f_2 x t frac partial f partial t x t be the second partial derivative we must prove f t int_a b f_2 x t d x we have f t lim_ u longrightarrow t frac f u f t u t lim_ u longrightarrow t int_a b frac f x u f x t u t dx and so what we must show is that lim_ u longrightarrow t int_a b left frac f x u f x t u t f_2 x t right dx 0 2 let t in u and let varepsilon 0 be given let c d be an open interval such that t in c d and c d subseteq u since f_2 partial f partial t is continuous on a b times c d it is uniformly continous therefore there exists a delta 0 such that if x x in a b and u u in c d and sqrt x x 2 u u delta then f_2 x u f_2 x u frac varepsilon b a assume that u t delta the mean value theorem for derivatives shows that there exists a v x between t and u such that frac f x u f x t u t f_2 x v x now left frac f x u f x t u t f_2 x t right le f_2 x v x f_2 x t frac varepsilon b a because t v t t u delta so if u t delta we have left int_a b left frac f x u f x t u t f_2 x t right dx right le int_a b f_2 x v x f_2 x t dx varepsilon proving 2 theorem 2 let f x y be a function that is continuous on the rectangle a b times c d then int_a b f x y dx 2 is a continuous function of y hence integrable we have int_c d int_a b f x y dx dy int_a b int_c d f x y dy d x 4 proof click to expand collapse let varepsilon 0 be given and y in c d since r a b times c d is compact f is uniformly continuous and so there exists a delta such that if sqrt t v 2 u w 2 delta with t u and v w in r then f t u f v w frac varepsilon b a so if y_1 y_2 delta we have left int_a b f x y_1 dx int_a b f x y_2 dx right le int_a b f x y_1 f x y_2 dx le int_a b frac varepsilon b a dx varepsilon this proves the continuity of 2 now consider phi y z int_a z f x y d x the partial derivative phi_2 y z frac partial phi partial z y z equals f x z hence is continuous therefore we may differentiate under the integral sign and obtain frac partial partial z int_c d int_a z f x y dx dy int_c d f z y dy frac partial partial z int_a z int_c d f x y dy d x the function psi z int_c d int_a z f x y dx dy int_a z int_c d f x y dy dx thus satisfies psi z 0 for all z in a b and psi z 0 by the mean value theorem psi b psi b psi a b a psi z for some z which proves 4
