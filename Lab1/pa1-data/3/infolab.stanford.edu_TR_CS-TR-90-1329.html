report number cs tr 90 1329 institution stanford university department of computer science title an interleaving model for real time author henzinger thomas a author manna z ohar author pnueli amir date september 1990 abstract the interleaving model is both adequate and sufficiently abstract to allow for the practical specification and verification of many properties of concurrent systems we incorporate real time into this model by defining the abstract notion of a real time transition system as a conservative extension of traditional transition systems qualitative fairness requirements are replaced and superseded by quantitative lower bound and upper bound real time requirements for transitions we present proof rules to establish lower and upper real time bounds for response properties of real time transition systems this proof system can be used to verify bounded invariance and bounded response properties such as timely terrnination of shared variables multi process systems whose semantics is defined in terms of real time transition systems ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 90 1329 cs tr 90 1329 pdf
