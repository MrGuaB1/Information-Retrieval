report number cs tr 86 1125 institution stanford university department of computer science title the caos system author schoen eric date march 1986 abstract the caos system is a framework designed to facilitate the development of highly concurrent real time signal interpretation applications it explores the potential of multiprocessor architectures to improve the performance of expert systems in the domain of signal interpretation caos is implemented in lisp on a simulated collection of processor memory sites linked by a high speed communiications subsystem the virtual machine on which it depends provides remote evaluation and packet based message exchange between processes using virtual circuits known as streams to this presentation layer caos adds 1 a flexible process scheduler and 2 an object centered notion of agents dynamically instantiable entities which model interpreted signal features this report documents the principal ideas programming model and implementation of caos a model of real time signal interpretation based on replicated abstraction pipelines is presented for some applications this model offers a means by which large numbers of processors may be utilized without introducing synchronization necessitated software bottlenecks the report concludes with a description of the performance of a large caos application over various sizes of multiprocessor configurations lessons about problem decomposition grain size global problem solving control strategy and appropriate service provided to caos by the underlying architecture are discussed ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 86 1125 cs tr 86 1125 pdf
