report number cs tr 94 1508 institution stanford university department of computer science title inverse kinematics of a human arm author kondo koichi date march 1994 abstract this paper describes a new inverse kinematics algorithm for a human arm potential applications of this algorithm include computer aided design and concurrent engineering from the viewpoint of human factors for example it may be used to evaluate a new design in terms of its usability and to automatically generate instruction videos the inverse kinematics algorithm is based on a sensorimotor transformation model developed in recent neurophysiological experiments this method can be applied to both static arm postures and human manipulation motions ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 94 1508 cs tr 94 1508 pdf
