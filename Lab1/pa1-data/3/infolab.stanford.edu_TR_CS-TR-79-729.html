report number cs tr 79 729 institution stanford university department of computer science title a unified approach to path problems author tarjan robert endre date april 1979 abstract we describe a general method for solving path problems on directed graphs such path problems include finding shortest paths solving sparse systems of linear equations and carrying out global flow analysis of computer programs our method consists of two steps first we construct a collection of regular expressions representing sets of paths in the graph this can be done by using any standard algorithm such as gaussian or gauss jordan elimination next we apply a natural mapping from regular expressions into the given problem domain we exhibit the mappings required to find shortest paths solve sparse systems of linear equations and carry out global flow analysis our results provide a general purpose algorithm for solving any path problem and show that the problem of constructing path expressions is in some sense the most general path problem ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 79 729 cs tr 79 729 pdf
