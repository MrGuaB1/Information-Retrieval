point set topology page 1 point set topology pdf version of this document for printing our textbook emphasizes metric spaces however metric spaces are special cases of a more fundamental class of spaces namely topological spaces and these are more fundamental than metric spaces so we will introduce topological spaces before we introduce metric spaces let be a set a topology is a set of subsets of with the following properties axiom 1 both and the empty set are in axiom 2 an arbitrary union of elements of is in thus if then axiom 3 a finite intersection of elements of is in thus if then the pair is called a topological space if the following additional axiom is satisfied the space is called a hausdorff topological space hausdorff axiom if are distinct there exist disjoint and in such that and basic definitions if is a topological space an element of is called an open set if is open then its complement is called a closed set every subset of contains a largest open subset called its interior indeed the interior may be defined to be be the union of all open subsets contained in then is open and any open subset contained in is contained in a subset of is open if and only if thus similarly every subset is contained in a unique smallest closed set called its closure we may define to be the intersection of all closed subsets of that contain a subset of is closed if and only if if then a neighborhood of is any subset of such that and such that contains an open subset of with and the neighborhood may or may not be open an open neighborhood of is just an open set containing if and are sets and is a map and is any subset then by definition if and are topological spaces then a map is called continuous if for all in words is continuous if the inverse image of an open set is open it is easy to see that a composition of continuous maps is continuous that is if and are continuous then so is page 2 suppose that is a topological space and is any subset then may be given a topology known as the subspace topology as follows let be the set of subsets of of the form where it is straightforward to prove that this is a topology let and be topological spaces let be the cartesian product of the sets and we will define a topology on called the product topology a subset of is open in the product topology if for every so there exist open neighborhoods and of and respectively such that equivalently a subset of is open if and only if it is a union of sets of the form with and open subsets of and respectively proposition 1 define and by and then and are continuous maps suppose is any topological space and and are continuous maps define by then is a continuous map proof if is an open set in then is open in so is continuous and similarly to prove that is continuous we must prove that if is an open subset of then is an open subset of since every open subset of is a union of subsets of the form with and open we may assume that is of this form then is an intersection of two open sets hence open compactness if is a topological space an open cover is set of open subsets such that if is another open cover such that then is called a subcover a topological space is called quasicompact if every open cover has a finite subcover a quasicompact hausdorff space is called compact quasicompact spaces that are not hausdorff arise in algebraic geometry with the zariski topology the hausdorff assumption for compact spaces is not important for us for two reasons on the one hand the book emphasizes metric spaces which are automatically compact on the other hand the writing assignment will concern compact spaces that are not assumed to be metric spaces however the hausdorff assumption will play no role in the proofs the heine borel theorem says that a closed interval in is compact let me state without proof three further important facts about compact spaces these are important enough that i think you should remember them you may find it intructive to prove them yourself proposition 2 let be a compact topological space and let be a closed subspace then is compact with the subspace topology proposition 3 let and be compact topological spaces then is compact proposition 4 let and be topological spaces with compact let be a continuous map then is compact sequential compactness page 3 if is a topological space then is called sequentially compact if every sequence of elements of has a convergent subsequence thus the bolzano weierstrass asserts that a closed unit interval is sequentially compact it is proved in the book that if is a metric space then is compact if and only if is sequentially compact for more general topological spaces these are distinct notions
