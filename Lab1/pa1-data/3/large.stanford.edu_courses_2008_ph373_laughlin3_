professor robert b laughlin department of physics stanford university graphene spin susceptibility rb laughlin may 19 2008 submitted as coursework for physics 373 stanford university spring 2008 fig 1 real blue and imaginary red parts of the graphene spin susceptibility as a function of frequency for various values of q top four values of q from 0 to half a reciprocal lattice vector or 2 3 in the direction of a bond bottom four values of q from 2 3 to 4 3 in the same direction the computer code that generated this graph is available here i plotted using gnuplot the plot file is shown here this report shows how the calculation for graphene's density of states described in my previous report can be modified to generate the spin susceptibility it is functionally the same calculation except for inclusion of the matrix element where we have as before as a practical matter we first compute the imaginary part where sgn denotes the sign and then hilbert transform the latex source for the above equations is available here
