report number cs tr 97 1600 institution stanford university department of computer science title an implementation of a combinatorial approximation algorithm for minimum cost multicommodity flow author goldberg andrew author oldham jeffrey d author plotkin serge author stein cliff date december 1997 abstract the minimum cost multicommodity flow problem involves simultaneously shipping multiple commodities through a single network so that the total flow obeys arc capacity constraints and has minimum cost multicommodity flow problems can be expressed as linear programs and most theoretical and practical algorithms use linear programming algorithms specialized for the problems structures combinatorial approximation algorithms yield flows with costs slightly larger than the minimum cost and use capacities slightly larger than the given capacities theoretically the running times of these algorithms are much less than that of linear programming based algorithms we combine and modify the theoretical ideas in these approximation algorithms to yield a fast practical implementation solving the minimum cost multicommodity flow problem experimentally the algorithm solved our problem instances to 1 accuracy two to three orders of magnitude faster than the linear programming package cplex and the linear programming based multicommodity flow program pprn ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 97 1600 cs tr 97 1600 pdf
