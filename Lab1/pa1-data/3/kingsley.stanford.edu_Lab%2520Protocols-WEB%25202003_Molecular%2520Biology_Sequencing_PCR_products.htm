sequencing pcr products sequencing pcr products mike shapiro doug menke version 1.0 01 27 04 1 perform pcr reaction using favorite polymerase in a total reaction volume of 50 l high fidelity polymerases such as pfu ultra stratagene are best for sequencing applications 2 run 5 8 l of pcr product on a 1 tae gel to verify presence and assess robustness of band s if no band is seen troubleshoot pcr reaction or do secondary reaction using 1 l of pcr product in a new 50 l reaction 3 run remaining pcr product on 2 tae gel at low voltage 40 ma v is a good start lower if bands are very close together 4 cut bands out of gel under low energy high wavelength uv light keep gel cutouts as small as possible to save time and reagents during gel purification 5 purify dna using qiaquick gel extraction kit protocol begins on pg 23 of manual be sure to do the optional additional buffer qg wash to remove all traces of agarose from the dna prep elute dna in 30 l of buffer eb 6 run 5 l of eluted dna on a 1 tae gel alongside a size mass ladder eg fermentas massruler to determine dna concentration in general 3 5 ng of dna works well for pcr products up to 700 bp dna quantities recommended by abi  100 200 bp 1 3 ng  200 500 bp 3 10 ng  500 1000 bp 5 20 ng  1000 2000 bp 10 40 ng  2000 bp 40 100 ng 7 prepare sequencing reaction sequencing reaction chemistry add primers and template to tubes first and then add master mix made from buffer water and big dye template x 1 100 ng see above primer 10 m 0.5 l 5x abi sequencing buffer 0.75 l big dye 3.1 1.5 l ddh 2 o 17.25 x l total volume 20 l
