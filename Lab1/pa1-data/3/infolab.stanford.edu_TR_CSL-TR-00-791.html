report number csl tr 00 791 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title precision of semi exact redundant continued fraction author mencer oskar author morf martin author flynn michael j date february 2000 abstract continued fractions cfs enable straightforward representation of elementary functions and rational approximations we improve the positional algebraic algorithm which computes homographic functions the improved algorithm for the linear fractional transformation produces exact results given regular continued fraction input in case the input is in redundant continued fraction form our improved linear algorithm increases the percentage of exact results with 12 bit state registers from 78 to 98 the maximal error of non exact results is improved indeed by detecting a small number of cases we can add a final correction step to improve the guaranteed accuracy of non exact results we refer to the fact that a few results may not be exact as semi exact arithmetic we detail the adjustments to the positional algebraic algorithm concerning register overflow the virtual singularities that occur during the computation and the errors due to non regular redundant cf inputs ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 00 791 csl tr 00 791 pdf
