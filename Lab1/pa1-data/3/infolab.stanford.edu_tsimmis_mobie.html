mobie home page mobie a www interface for object based databases overview as part of the tsimmis project at stanford we have built a system called mobie for formatting and displaying semi structured information as a web of hypertext documents using html and http the contents of these documents can then be explored using the built in functionality of a web browser much in the same way one would explore the contents of a book as part of mobie users can customize the formatting of their results by choosing different layouts or controlling how much of the object structure is visible in the browser for example in its current implementation mobie is used with information that has been translated into oem object exchange model which is used as the common data model in tsimmis for our prototype demo we are using a variety of sources eg a relational dbms a collection of flat files an online library etc that are queried through one of the tsimmis query languages more on information tarnaslation and querying can be obtained from the tsimmis home page naming as an acronym mobie stands for mosaic based information explorer when we started developping mobie mosaic was the only web browser available and we liked it so much that we made mosaic part of the name however it is misleading in the sense that mobie is really based on http and html and can be used with any forms capable web browser last modified on thursday october 31 1996 the tsimmis group at stanford tsimmis db stanford edu
