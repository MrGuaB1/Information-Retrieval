report number cs tr 88 1210 institution stanford university department of computer science title string functional semantics for formal verification of synchronous circuits author bronstein alexandre author talcott carolyn l date june 1988 abstract a new functional semantics is proposed for synchronous circuits as a basis for reasoning formally about that class of hardware systems technically we define an extensional semantics with monotonic length preserving functions on finite strings and an intensional semantics based on functionals on those functions as support for the semantics we prove the equivalence of the extensional semantics with a simple operational semantics as well as a characterization of circuits which obey the every loop is clocked design rule also we develop the foundations in complete detail both to increase confidence in the theory and as a prerequisite to its future mechanization ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 88 1210 cs tr 88 1210 pdf
