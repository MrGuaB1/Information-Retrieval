report number cs tr 83 973 institution stanford university department of computer science title the distributed v kernel and its performance for diskless workstations author cheriton david r author z waenepoel willy date july 1983 abstract the distributed v kernel is a message oriented kernel that provides uniform local and network interprocess communication it is primarily being used in an environment of diskless workstations connected by a high speed local network to a set of file servers we describe a performance evaluation of the kernel with particular emphasis on the cost of network file access our results show that over a local network 1 diskless workstations can access remole files with minimal performance penalty 2 the v message facility can be used to access remote files at comparable cost to any well tuned specialized file access protocol we conclude that it is feasible to build a distributed system with all network communication using the v message facility even when most of the network nodes have no secondary storage ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 83 973 cs tr 83 973 pdf
