integration page 1 integration our textbook develops the theory of integration in greater generality than we have time for in these notes i will give a shorter route to the fundamental theorem of calculus the intention is to bypass most of sections 52 55 theorem 1 let f be a continuous function on a b define f x x a f t dt 1 then f is differentiable on a b and f f proof we will first show that if x a b then f r x f x similarly one may show that if x a b then f l x f x but we leave this to the reader let x a b and let  0 be given we will show there exists a  0 such x  b and such that if y x x  then f y f x y x f x  2 this will prove that f r x lim y x+ f y f x y x f x because f is continuous we may choose  such that x y  implies that f x f y  let y x x  by the mean value theorem for integrals theorem 51.14 of the text there exists c x x  such that f y f x y x f t dt y x f c 1 page 2 therefore f y f x y x f x f c f x  as required this proves 2 and therefore that f r x f x we leave the left hand derivative to the reader d proposition 1 suppose that f is differentiable on a b and that f x 0 for all x a b then f is a constant function that is f x f a for all x a b proof let x a b by the mean value theorem theorem 49.6 there exists c a x such that f x f a x a f c since f c 0 we see that f x f a as required d if f is a continuous function on a b by an antiderivative of f we mean a function f that is differentiable on a b such that f f theorem 1 shows that f has antiderivatives for example 1 theorem 2 let f be a continuous function on a b and let f be an an tiderivative of f then b a f t dt f b f a 3 proof define  x x a f t dt then  is also an antiderivative of f by theorem 1 so f  0 and therefore f  is constant by proposition 1 we thus have f b  b f a  a f a since  a 0 therefore  b f b f a which is 3 d theorems 1 and 2 together form the fundamental theorem of calculus in sufficient generality for our purposes in the book this is theorem 56.1 there is one important result in the sections that we will be skipping namely the integration by parts formula a version of this is in the book as theorem 53.3 2 page 3 proposition 2 integration by parts suppose that f and g are differ entiable on a b then b a f x g x dx b a g x f x dx f b g b f a g a 4 proof we note that by the leibnitz rule theorem 48.5 b we have fg f g fg so by the fundamental theorem of calculus f b g b f a g a b a f x g x f x g x dx rearranging gives 4 d 3
