clearance rate2 clearance rate as an expression of drug elimination rate another method aside from renal excretion by which drugs are cleared from the body is through metabolism however it is not possible to measure directly the amount cleared by metabolism calculation of the total clearance rate tcr or total body clearance can be made from its pharmacokinetic parameters utilizing this equation tcr k el v d example 2 procaine's biological half life within a patient is 30 minutes and its volume of distribution is approximately 60 liters calculate the tcr of procaine solution when metabolism and urinary excretion both occur in the excretion of a drug it is possible to calculate the metabolic clearance rate mcr by taking the difference of tcr and rcr mcr tcr rcr alternatively the rcr and mcr can be calculated by using the following formulas rcr can be obtained by multiplying the tcr by the fraction of the dose excreted unchanged into urine f e rcr f e tcr and if we can assume that the fraction of the dose not appearing unchanged in the urine has been metabolized the mcr is just mcr 1 f e tcr example 3 sulfadiazine has a biological half life of 19hr in a patient and a volume of distribution of 13 liters sixty percent of the dose was recovered as unchanged drug in urine calculate tcr rcr and mcr for sulfadiazine in the person solution in this section we have assumed that there are only two means by which drugs are eliminated from the body this assumption we should note is incorrect since drugs not appearing unchanged in the urine but are eliminated unchanged in feces are assumed to have been metabolized the values for clearance rates are greatly affected by this assumption b 7c 3
