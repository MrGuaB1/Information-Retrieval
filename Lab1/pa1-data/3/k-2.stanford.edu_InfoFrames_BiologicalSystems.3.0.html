name muscular system definition the muscular system is comprised mostly of skeletal muscles attached to bones but also includes cardiac and smooth muscles structure the skeletal muscles are attached to the bones at places called orgins in locations that provide movements of the bones upon voluntary muscular contraction cardiac muscle makes up the heart and smooth muscle is in many places especially in the digestive and the circulatory systems muscles are stimulated by nerve impulses that travel by creating action potentials that reach the end of a nerve fiber function the skeletal muscles respond to the will and are the engines that maintain posture and produce motion cardiac and smooth muscles are controlled by the autonomic nervous system as action potentials either reach the end of a nerve the either stimulate another action potential in another fiber or the reach an effector cell where they stimulate the release of neurotransmitters if for example the effector cell is at a myo neural endplate a muscle contraction will result if the signal is strong enough or reaches a certain threshold questions questions evaluation for me this frame was difficult ok fun easy too easy copyright c 1997 stanford university all rights reserved for more information please contact creatures summit stanford edu or visit the virtual creatures website
