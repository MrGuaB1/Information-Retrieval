anaerobic bacteria this report is incomplete author must fix rbl anaerobic bacteria elia junco october 24 2010 submitted as coursework for physics 240 stanford university fall 2010 despite several attempts to reduce our energy consumption the rate of energy resources are either not efficient or produce hazardous final reactions many new energy resources are being researched however instead of looking into a new energy source why not look at turning an environmental problem into a solution one example of this is the uncontrolled release of greenhouse gases due to the generation and disposal of organic waste in addition to this environmental problem the treatments used to reduce these greenhouse gases is energy intensive and expensive anaerobic digestion of biomass could be a solution to both of these issues by converting the biodegradable fraction of the waste into high calorific gases such as methane producing electricity and heat this biogas can be collected and used as a fuel by either piping it out of landfills or from the anaerobic digestion of sewage waste products or manure this combination of heat and power production is important due to the power produced and heat production needed for the bacteria therefore this non renewable energy can be met the demands for both the production of electricity and heat displacing non renewable energy and reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the air elia junco the author grants permission to copy distribute and display this work in unaltered form with attribution to the author for noncommercial purposes only all other rights including commercial rights are reserved to the author
