report number cs tn 96 33 institution stanford university department of computer science title a computational group theoretic approach to steerable functions author teo patrick c author hel or yacov date april 1996 abstract we present a computational group theoretic approach to steerable functions the approach is group theoretic in that the treatment involves continuous transformation groups for which elementary lie group theory may be applied the approach is computational in that the theory is constructive and leads directly to a procedural implementation for functions that are steerable with n basis functions under a k parameter group the procedure is efficient in that at most nk 1 iterations of the procedure are needed to compute all the basis functions furthermore the procedure is guaranteed to return the minimum number of basis functions if the function is not steerable a numerical implementation of the procedure could be used to compute basis functions that approximately steer the function over a range of parameters examples of both applications are described ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tn 96 33 cs tn 96 33 pdf
