report number csl tr 94 622 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title a synthesis for test design system author avra lanae j author gerbaux laurent author giomi jean charles author martinolle francoise author mccluskey edward j date may 1994 abstract hardware synthesis techniques automatically generate a structural hardware implementation given an abstract eg functional behavioral register transfer description of the behavior of the design existing hardware synthesis systems typically use cost and performance as the main criteria for selecting the best hardware implementation and seldom even consider test issues during the synthesis process we have developed and implemented a computer aided design tool whose primary objective is to generate the lowest cost highest performance hardware implementation that also meets specified testability requirements by considering testability during the synthesis process the tool is able to generate designs that are optimized for specific test techniques the input to the tool is a behavioral vhdl specification that consists of high level software language constructs such as conditional statements assignment statements and loops and the output is a structural vhdl description of the design implemented synthesis procedures include compiler optimizations inter process analysis high level synthesis operations scheduling allocation and binding and control logic generation the purpose of our design tool is to serve as a platform for experimentation with existing and future synthesis for test techniques and it can currently generate designs optimized for both parallel and circular built in self test architectures ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 94 622 csl tr 94 622 pdf
