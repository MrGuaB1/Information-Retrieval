report number csl tr 93 596 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title models of communication latency in shared memory multiprocessors author byrd gregory t date december 1993 abstract we evaluate various mechanisms for data communication in large scale shared memory multiprocessors data communication involves both data transmission and synchronization resulting in the transfer of data between computational threads we use simple analytical models to evaluate the communication latency for each of the mechanisms the models show that efficient and opportunistic synchronization is the most important determinant of latency followed by efficient transmission producer initiated mechanisms in which data is sent by its producer as it is produced generally achieve lower latencies than consumer initated mechanisms in which data is retrieved as and when it is needed ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 93 596 csl tr 93 596 pdf
