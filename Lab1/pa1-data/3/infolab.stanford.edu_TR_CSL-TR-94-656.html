report number csl tr 94 656 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title i o characterization and attribute cache data for eleven measured workloads author richardson kathy j date december 1994 abstract workloads generate a variety of disk i o requests to access file information execute programs and perform computation workload characterization is crucial to optimizing i o system performance this report contains detailed workload characterization data for eleven measured workloads it includes numerous tables and cache behavior plots for each workload the workload i o traces from which the characterization is derived include both file system information and i o system information where previous traces only included one or the other the additional information allows i o characterization at the system level and greatly increases the body of knowledge about the make up and type of disk i o requested the new information shows that the i o request stream contains statistically diverse components that can be separated this allows the important features of the workload to be captured at the appropriate cache size and increases the total cache utilization note this technical report is a companion report to the dissertation i o characterization and attribute caches for improved i o system performance csl tr 94 655 while the dissertation is self contained this report is not it presents data that is analyzed and discussed only in the dissertation ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 94 656 csl tr 94 656 pdf
