report number csl tr 94 621 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title synthesis for scan dependence in built in self testable designs author avra lanae j author mccluskey edward j date may 1994 abstract this report introduces new design and synthesis techniques that reduce the area and improve the performance of embedded built in self test bist architectures such as circular bist and parallel bist our goal is to arrange the system bistables into scan paths so that some of the bist and scan logic is shared with the system logic logic sharing is possible when scan dependence is introduced in the design other bist design techniques attempt to avoid all types of scan dependence because it can reduce the fault coverage of embedded multiple input signature registers misrs we show that introducing certain types of scan dependence in embedded misrs can result in reduced overhead and improved fault coverage and we describe synthesis techniques that maximize the amount of this beneficial scan dependence finally we present fault simulation layout area and delay results for circular bist versions of benchmark circuits that have been synthesized with our techniques ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 94 621 csl tr 94 621 pdf
