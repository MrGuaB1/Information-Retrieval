report number cs tr 96 1566 institution stanford university department of computer science title clocked transition systems author manna z ohar author pnueli amir date april 1996 abstract this paper presents a new computational model for real time systems called the clocked transition system model the model is a development of our previous timed transition model where some of the changes are inspired by the model of timed automata the new model leads to a simpler style of temporal specification and verification requiring no extension of the temporal language for verifying safety properties we present a run preserving reduction from the new real time model to the untimed model of fair transition systems this reduction allows the re use of safety verification methods and tools developed for untimed reactive systems for proving safety properties of real time systems ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 96 1566 cs tr 96 1566 pdf
