doctalk off the wire medworld feature malaria mosquitos favor sweaty feet by paul wheeler october 23 1995 researchers in amsterdam found that sweaty feet and smelly dutch cheese whet the appetites of malaria mosquitos in a test involving people with washed and unwashed feet malaria mosquitos showed a clear preference for the scent found on human feet furthermore the dutch entymologists discovered that these mosquitos were equally attracted to a piece of strongly scented ripe dutch limburger cheese according to the scientists this makes sense because limburger a pungent white soft cheese smells a lot like the toe cheese found between human toes unfortunately no matter how much you wash your feet you ll never be able to completely get rid of the smell because its simply a basic human smell hence washing feet more often is probably not a plausible defense against malaria so what does this study have to do with you well researchers hope that one day they can reproduce the odor artifically and use them in making better mosquito traps so till then keep those feet clean and lay off on the cheese back to doctalk dieting makes you dopey copyright 1996 medworld project all rights reserved
