report number cs tr 67 81 institution stanford university department of computer science title calculation of gauss quadrature rules author golub gene h author welsch john h date november 1967 abstract most numerical integration techniques consist of approximating the integrand by a polynomial in a region or regions and then integrating the polynomial exactly often a complicated integrand can be factored into a non negative weight function and another function better approximated by a polynomial thus int_ a b g t dt int_ a b omega t f t dt approx sum_ i 1 n w_i f t_i hopefully the quadrature rule w_j t_j _ j 1 n corresponding to the weight function omega t is available in tabulated form but more likely it is not we present here two algorithms for generating the gaussian quadrature rule defined by the weight function when a the three term recurrence relation is known for the orthogonal polynomials generated by omega t and b the moments of the weight function are known or can be calculated ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 67 81 cs tr 67 81 pdf
