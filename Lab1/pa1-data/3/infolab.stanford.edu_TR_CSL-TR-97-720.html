report number csl tr 97 720 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title a simulation study of ip switching author lin steven author mckeown nick date april 1997 abstract recently there has been much interest in combining the speed of layer 2 switching with the features of layer 3 routing this has been prompted by numerous proposals including ip switching tag switching aris csr and ip over atm in this paper we study ip switching and evaluate the performance claims made by newman et al in particular using nine network traces we study how well ip switching performs with traffic found in campus corporate and internet service provider isp environments our main finding is that ip switching will lead to a high proportion of datagrams that are switched over 75 in all of the environments we studied we also investigate the effects that different flow classifiers and various timer values have on performance and note that some choices can result in a large vc space requirement finally we present recommendations for the flow classifier and timer values as a function of the vc space of the switch and the network environment being served ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 97 720 csl tr 97 720 pdf
