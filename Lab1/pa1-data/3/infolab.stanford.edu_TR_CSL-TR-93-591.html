report number csl tr 93 591 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title logic synthesis for concurrent error detection author touba nur a author mccluskey edward j date november 1993 abstract the structure of a circuit determines how the effects of a fault can propagate and hence affects the cost of concurrent error detection by considering circuit structure during logic optimization the overall cost of a concurrently checked circuit can be minimized this report presents a new technique called structure constrained logic optimization sclo that optimizes a circuit under the constraint that faults in the resulting circuit can produce only a prescribed set of errors using sclo circuits can be optimized for various concurrent error detection schemes allowing the overall cost for each scheme to be compared a technique for quickly estimating the size of a circuit under different structural constraints is described this technique enables rapid exploration of the design space for concurrently checked circuits a new method for the automated synthesis of self checking circuit implementations for arbitrary combinational circuits is also presented it consists of an algorithm that determines the best parity check code for encoding the output of a given circuit and then uses sclo to produce the functional circuit which is augmented with a checker to form a self checking circuit this synthesis method provides fully automated design explores a larger design space than other methods and uses simple checkers it has been implemented by making modifications to sis an updated version of mis brayton 87a and results for several mcnc combinational benchmark circuits are given in most cases a substantial reduction in overhead compared to a duplicate and compare implementation is achieved ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 93 591 csl tr 93 591 pdf
