special topics in group theory page 1 department colloquium thursday january 26 4 15pm building 380 room 380 w william minicozzi johns hopkins dynamics and singularities of mean curvature flow abstract mean curvature flow mcf is a nonlinear heat equation where the hypersurface evolves to minimize its surface area if we start the flow at any closed hypersurface in rn then singularities must develop the major problem is to understand the possible singularities and the behavior of the flow near a singularity i will survey work on this with toby colding
