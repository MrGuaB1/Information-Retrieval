stream prototype source code stream prototype source code introduction this page contains information about the latest as of feb 05 source code release of the stanford stream data manager prototype stream more information about the stream project can be found here this release contains the code for the main stream server and for a gui client to interact with the server over a network the server can also be used as a library and directly linked from a c++ program the code release includes an extensive user manual that contains detailed information about the functionality and design of the stream prototype the stream source code is released under the bsd license downloading the code building the server testing the server building the client using the system downloading the code server code client code building the server the code has been packaged using the standard gnu tools so the usual technique for installing such packages works for illustration we assume that the code will be extracted built and installed in the following set of directories directory where the code is extracted home user stream 0.6 0 directory where the binaries libraries and headers should be installed after building home user stream system requirements gnu build tools bison and flex the code has been built and tested only on linux platforms steps cd home user stream 0.6 0 configure prefix home user stream make make install these four steps generate home user stream bin net_server the main server that talks to the gui client home user stream bin gen_client a standalone server with a thin command line client home user stream lib libdsms so the stream library that can be directly linked to your c++ program home user stream include the header files for use with the library the configure script accepts other options for more fine grained control of the installation run configure help for a list of these options testing the server we have provided a collection of test scripts to check if the server has been built properly to run the tests cd home user stream 0.6 0 test test sh to remove the temporary files produced while testing cd home user stream 0.6 0 test cleanup sh building the client system requirements java 5.0 runtime environment jdk 1.5 0 compiler earlier versions of jdk are probably fine too but we haven t tested these apache ant 1.6 2 steps the following steps assume for illustration that the client code has been extracted to home user stream vis 0.3 0 cd home user stream vis 0.3 0 chmod x geninit sh geninit sh ant these four steps generate the jar file streamvis jar at home user stream vis 0.3 0 lib using the system the most convenient way of using stream is to start the net version of the server net_server and connect to it using the gui client the gui client allows you to register streams and queries with the server view the query plans generated by the server and monitor the performance of the server the links below provide information on how to start the server and use the client running the server running the client there are two other ways of using the stream prototype you can use the command line version of the server gen_client or directly link server library to a c++ program these two methods are more suitable for profiling purposes please see the user manual for more details questions please send your questions and comments to streamdev db stanford edu last modified nov 08 2004
