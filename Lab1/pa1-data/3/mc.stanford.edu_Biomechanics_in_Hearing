mechanics and computation biomechanics in hearing stanford mechanics and computation home people research teaching seminar schedule faq biomechanics in hearing the sense and sensitivity of hearing is one of the most remarkable examples of a biomechanical system mammals are unique in their ability to hear high frequency sounds above 10 khz presumably for sound localization they have unique anatomical structures to support high frequency hearing which includes a four layer composite eardrum three middle ear bones and hair cells that have piezo electric like properties the otobiomechanics group at stanford is developing anatomically based three dimensional and multi scale computational models of the middle ear and the cochlea we combine dynamical measurements of the ear with advances in medical imaging of anatomical structures and three dimensional bio computational modeling our plan is to build multiscale computational models of sound transmission of the eardrum middle ear bones cochlear partition hair cells and hair cell tip links with dimensions ranging from cm to nm an eclectic mix of wkb asymptotic shell theory and finite element computational methods combined with imaging modalities that includes uct multiphoton microscopy single harmonic generation and s tem is used to elucidate the underlying principles for high frequency hearing the talk will summarize the current status with an eye towards future projects retrieved from http mc stanford edu cgi bin index php title biomechanics_in_hearing&oldid 2045 member login log in page discussion view source history what links here related changes upload file special pages editing instructions
