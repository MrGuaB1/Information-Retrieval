report number csl tr 87 333 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title managing and measuring two parallel programs on a multiprocessor author yan jerry c date june 1987 abstract research is being conducted to determine how distributed computations can be mapped onto multiprocessors so as to minimize execution time instead of employing optimization techniques based on some abstract program machine models the approach being investigated here called post game analysis is based on placement heuristics which utilizes program execution history although initial experiments have demonstrated that post game analysis indeed discovered mappings that exhibit significantly shorter execution times than the worst cases for the programs tested three important issues remain to be addressed i the need to evaluate the performance of placement heuristics against the optimal speed up attainable ii to find evidence to help explain why these heuristics work and iii to develop better heuristics by understanding how and why the basic set performed well parallel program execution was simulated using axe an integrated environment for computation model description processor architecture specification discrete time simulation and automated data collection five groups of parameters are measured representing different aspects in the concurrent execution environment i overall measurements ii communication parameters iii cpu utilization iv cpu contention and v dependencies between players two programs were simulated a pipe line of players and a divide and conquer program skeleton the results showed that program execution time indeed correlated well with some of the parameters measured it was also shown that post game analysis achieved close to 96 optimal speed up for both programs in most cases ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 87 333 csl tr 87 333 pdf
