mechanics and computation dynamic biomechanics of the aqueous humor and iris stanford mechanics and computation home people research teaching seminar schedule faq professor victor barocas dynamic biomechanics of the aqueous humor and iris the iris the colored part of the eye that controls the amount of light passing through the pupil and the clear aqueous humor that flows around it constitute an important coupled bimechanical system the flow of aqueous humor sets the intraocular pressure and elevated intraocular pressure can lead to glaucoma in pigmentary glaucoma and angle closure glaucoma in particular a pathological iris contour is responsible for the disease state a particular challenge in analyzing iris mechanics arises because the anterior segment is never static in a waking subject blinking changes in focal depth and changes in available light occur routinely and understanding the mechanics of the iris contour requires investigation of dynamic phenomena the seminar will focus on finite element models of the coupled system description of dynamic events and their consequences for iris contour and some experiments on mechanical properties of the iris retrieved from http mc stanford edu cgi bin index php title dynamic_biomechanics_of_the_aqueous_humor_and_iris&oldid 1209 member login log in page discussion view source history what links here related changes upload file special pages editing instructions
