iutam symposium on computer models in biomechanics stanford international union of theoretical and applied mechanics iutam symposium on computer models in biomechanics from nano to macro august 29 september 02 2011 stanford university california usa home overview speakers program proceedings photos venue welcome to the 2011 iutam symposium on computer models in biomechanics the computational modeling of biomechanics and mechanobiology is one of the most exciting and at the same time one of the most challenging problems of mechanics in the 21st century mechanical modeling and computational simulations in biology hold promise to provide new insight into complex multiscale and multiphysics phenomena of living tissue the quantitative analysis of biomechanical processes on the molecular cellular tissue and organ levels might enable reliable predictions of the progression of various types of disease this may allow us within the next decade or two to perform real time patient specific simulations to guide the design of optimal treatment strategies to live up to these tremendous expectations research in computational biomechanics must be highly multidisciplinary the goal of this iutam symposium is therefore to bring together leading experts in cell mechanics continuum mechanics computational mechanics bioengineering and regenerative medicine to encourage critical discussion and identify important trends and directions in computational biomechanics news june 30 2011 deadline for online registration march 30 2011 fellowship recipients have been selected and notified december 31 2010 deadline for abstract submission november 01 2010 the website will now be open for fellowship applications july 01 2010 the website is now open for online registration july 01 2010 the website is now open for abstract submission this iutam symposium is sponsored by the national science foundation nsf cmmi site designed by jonathan wong
