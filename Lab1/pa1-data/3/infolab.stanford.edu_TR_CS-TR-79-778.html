report number cs tr 79 778 institution stanford university department of computer science title a hierarchical associative architecture for the parallel evaluation of relational algebraic database primitives author shaw david elliot date october 1979 abstract algorithms are described and analyzed for the efficient evaluation of the primitive operators of a relational algebra on a proposed non von neumann machine based on a hierarchy of associative storage devices this architecture permits an o log n decrease in time complexity over the best known evaluation methods on a conventional computer system without the use of redundant storage and using currently available and potentially competitive technology in many eases of practical import the proposed architecture may also permit a significant improvement by a factor roughly proportional to the capacity of the primary associative storage device over the performance of previously implemented or proposed database machine architectures based on associative secondary storage devices ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 79 778 cs tr 79 778 pdf
