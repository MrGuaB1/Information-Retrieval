report number cs tr 88 1203 institution stanford university department of computer science title on the semantics of temporal logic prograrnrning author baudinet marianne date june 1988 abstract recently several researchers have suggested directly exploiting in a programming language temporal logic's ability to describe changing worlds the resulting languages are quite diverse they are based on different subsets of temporal logic and use a variety of execution mechanisms so far little attention has been paid to the formal semantics of these languages in this paper we study the semantics of an instance of temporal logic programming namely the templog language defined by abadi and manna we first give declarative semantics for templog in model theoretic and in fixpoint terms then we study its operational semantics and prove soundness and completeness theorems for the temporal resolution proof method underlying its execution mechanism ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 88 1203 cs tr 88 1203 pdf
