change detection in hierarchically structured information next next introduction change detection in hierarchically structured information sudarshan s chawathe anand rajaraman hector garcia molina and jennifer widom department of computer science stanford university stanford california 94305 chaw anand hector widom cs stanford edu abstract detecting and representing changes to data is important for active databases data warehousing view maintenance and version and configuration management most previous work in change management has dealt with flat file and relational data we focus on hierarchically structured data since in many cases changes must be computed from old and new versions of the data we define the hierarchical change detection problem as the problem of finding a minimum cost edit script that transforms one data tree to another and we present efficient algorithms for computing such an edit script our algorithms make use of some key domain characteristics to achieve substantially better performance than previous general purpose algorithms we study the performance of our algorithms both analytically and empirically and we describe the application of our techniques to hierarchically structured documents introduction related work overview and preliminaries edit operations edit scripts a cost model for edit scripts generating the edit script outline of algorithm aligning children the complete algorithm finding good matchings matching criteria for keyless data a matching algorithm implementation and performance implementation empirical evaluation of fastmatch quality of fastmatch's matching summary and future work references about this document sudarshan s chawathe wed jun 19 08 22 34 pdt 1996
