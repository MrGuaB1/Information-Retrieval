report number csl tr 95 669 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title testing bicmos and dynamic cmos logic author ma siyad date june 1995 abstract in a normal integrated circuit ic production cycle manufactured ics are tested to remove defective parts the purpose of this research is to study the effects of real defects in bicmos and dynamic cmos circuits and propose better test solutions to detect these defects bicmos and dynamic cmos circuits are used in many new high performance vlsi ics fault models for bicmos and dynamic cmos circuits are discussed first shorted and open transistor terminals the most common failure modes in mos and bipolar transistors are simulated for bicmos and dynamic cmos logic gates simulations show that a faulty behavior similar to data retention faults in memory cells can occur in bicmos and dynamic cmos logic gates we explain here why it is important to test for these faults and present test techniques that can detect these faults simulation results also show that shorts and opens in dynamic cmos and bicmos circuits are harder to test than their counterparts in static cmos circuits simulation results also show that the testability of opens in bicmos gates can be predicted without time consuming transistor level simulations we present a prediction method based on an extended switch level model for bicmos gates to improve the testability of dynamic cmos circuits design for testability circuitry are proposed scan cell designs add scan capabilities to dynamic latches and flip flops with negligible performance overhead while design for current testability circuitry allows quiescent supply current iddq measurements for dynamic cmos circuits ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 95 669 csl tr 95 669 pdf
