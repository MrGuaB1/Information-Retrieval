repetitive extravascular dosing repetitive extravascular dosing c min and c max can also be calculated if the drug is administered via an extravascular route the equations however become more complex from an equation describing the plasma concentration versus time curve after one extravascular administration our new equation may be written as follows where d is the dose administered and f is the fraction of the dosage absorbed fd d g o at certain fixed intervals t n doses of the drug are administered and so the plasma concentrations following the nth dose are obtained by where t is the time elapsed after the nth dose when n is large as when the plasma reach a plateau the terms exp nk el t and exp nk a t become neglibly small and so the equation simplifies to b 9c 1
