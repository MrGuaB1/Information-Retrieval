numeric problems 1 3 numeric problems involving first order processes type 1 assuming a drug is eliminated from plasma through a first order linear process and given the rate constant or half life and the initial concentration of a drug in plasma calculate the concentration at some time in the future example 1 a penicillin solution containing 300 units ml has a half life of 8 days in plasma what will the concentration be in 7 days solution type 2 assuming a drug is eliminated from plasma through a first order linear process and given the half life or rate constant and the initial concentration of a drug in plasma calculate the time required to reach a specified lower concentration example 2 a penicillin solution has a half life of 6 days how long will it take for the concentration to drop to 70 of the initial concentration solution type 3 assuming a drug is eliminated from plasma through a first order process and given an initial concentration and the concentration of a drug in plasma after a specified elapsed time calculate the rate constant or half life example 3 a penicillin solution has an initial potency of 90mg 6ml after 1 month in a cold room the concentration is found to be 80mg 6ml what is the half life of the penicillin solution under the storage conditions solution b 6
