stanford mechanical engineering stanford engineering intranet graduate students human centered sustainable design at the graduate level the me program aligns academic course work with research to prepare scholars in specialized areas within the field of mechanical engineering human centered design and design for sustainability are themes that span all of the programs in the department where engineering has in the past been primarily concerned with feasibility the department recognizes a critical need to focus on a broader set of design criteria including usability viability desirability sustainability and environmental impact interdisciplinary research a fundamental value incorporation of this broader perspective requires access to and collaboration with other disciplines including the environmental social and material sciences as well as electrical engineering biology and other fields department research projects and the structure of the department's labs and centers incorporate at their core the philosophy of interdisciplinary problem solving by the way we have structured the academic environment the department offers strength in bringing together the necessary disciplines for solving modern engineering problems and provides a broad based flexible environment in which students are able to pursue their developing interests the pioneering research conducted within the department and related organizations has been made possible to a large extent by our collaborative and flexible environment five academic themes that shape the department the five main academic themes of the department are biomedicine computational engineering design energy multi scale engineering the five programs within the department are built around these themes where a continued emphasis on fundamental understanding of a range of engineering and scientific concepts is combined with a sensitized empathy for human need the department's aim is to help produce academic and industry leaders we believe that because of our unique and forward thinking approach to research incorporating these five academic themes as well as our emphasis on human centered design and sustainability our graduates are widely sought after related topics biomechanical engineering design flow physics and computational engineering mechanics and computation thermosciences associate professor chris gerdes right and graduate student matt roelle one of the great things about stanford is that there are col laborations that allow us to do things that are really interdisciplinary more chris gerdes associate professor of me multi disciplinary problem solving the greatest productivity occurs at the intersection of many disciplines engineering medicine business the humanities education and more allowing problems to be solved from a multitude of perspectives more david kelley professor of me stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni prospective students undergraduate students applying bachelors degrees financial support graduate students applying doctor of philosophy financial support masters of science careers in me meet our students themes that define us groups & programs faculty & research admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
