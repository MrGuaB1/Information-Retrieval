mechanics and computation stanford mechanics and computation home people research teaching seminar schedule faq news check out our seminar introduction teaching and research in the mechanics and computation group is devoted to the study of a broad range of mechanical phenomena including the behavior of solids fluids biological tissue and complex materials under the actions of loads the ultimate goals of this effort are to discover new scientific knowledge relevant to engineering problems of the future to enhance technological development in a broad range of industries to improve health in society and to advance national security and defense much of the research conducted within the group is interdisciplinary in nature reflecting a combination of concepts methods and principles that often span several areas of mechanics mathematics computer sciences materials science biology and numerous other scientific disciplines our approach often combines experimental or clinical studies with theoretical modeling and numerical simulation to create tools that both explain phenomena and predict behavior and that may be used to advance concepts and designs in industry to achieve our educational objectives our teaching and research encompasses computational mechanics multiphysics modeling computational bioengineering and microscale devices where to find us the mechanics and computation group is located in the william f durand building the building provides offices computer facilities research laboratories and seminar rooms for faculty research associates and graduate students of the group retrieved from http mc stanford edu cgi bin index php title main_page&oldid 1729 member login log in page discussion view source history what links here related changes upload file special pages editing instructions
