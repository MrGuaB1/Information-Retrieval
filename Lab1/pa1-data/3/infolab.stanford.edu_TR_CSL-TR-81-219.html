report number csl tr 81 219 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title consistency in interprocessor communications for fault tolerant multiprocessors author fu peter lincoln date september 1981 abstract consistency among processors is vital for fault tolerant multiprocessors this report describes modular communication interprocessor interface units which implement distributed consistency schemes such that failures within a single processor module cannot affect the consistency of data transferred among the remaining processors furthermore one scheme provides concurrent and consistent self diagnosis data on the integrity of the units themselves another scheme is tolerant to almost all failures within two processor modules the theory of the schemes are explained and their implementations in lsi circuits are described in detail the interprocessor communication structure defined by any of these schemes serves well as a critical element in highly reliable multiprocessor systems ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 81 219 csl tr 81 219 pdf
