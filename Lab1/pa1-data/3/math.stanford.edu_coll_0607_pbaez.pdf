stanford department of mathematics colloquium page 1 stanford department of mathematics colloquium higher gauge theory john baez university of california at riverside abstract gauge theory describes the parallel transport of point particles using the formalism of con nections on bundles in both string theory and loop quantum gravity point particles are replaced by 1 dimensional extended objects paths or loops in space this suggests that we seek some sort of higher gauge theory that describes parallel transport as we move a path through space tracing out a surface to find the right mathematical language for this we must categorify concepts from topology and geometry replacing smooth manifolds by smooth categories lie groups by lie 2 groups bundles by 2 bundles and so on some inter esting examples of these concepts show up in the mathematics of topological quantum field theory string theory and 11 dimensional supergravity thursday december 7 4 15 pm room 380 w http math stanford edu coll 0607
