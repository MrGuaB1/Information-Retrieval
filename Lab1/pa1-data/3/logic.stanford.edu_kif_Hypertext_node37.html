monotonic rules next up previous next logic programs up nonmonotonicity previous nonmonotonicity monotonic rules a monotonic rule is an expression of the following form or its reverse using where are sentences such an expression should be distinguished from an implication like the following athough sentences can be monotonic rules monotonic rules are not sentences they are similar to inference rules familiar from elementary logic if for instance consists of some sentences and one rule where and are sentences without free variables then the set of sentences entailed by is the smallest set of sentences which i contains ii is closed under logical entailment and iii contains provided that it contains it is not generally true that this set contains the implication the rationale for using monotonic rules in knowledge representation instead of implications is twofold on the one hand the directed character of rules can simplify the task of developing efficient inference procedures on the other hand in some cases replacing by would be semantically unacceptable for instance the rules status known x citizen x status known x not citizen x allow us to infer status known joe only if one of the sentences citizen joe not citizen joe can be inferred replacing the rules by implications would make status known x identically true vishal i sikka wed dec 7 13 23 42 pst 1994
