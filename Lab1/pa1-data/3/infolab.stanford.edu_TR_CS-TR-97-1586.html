report number cs tr 97 1586 institution stanford university department of computer science title construction of a three dimensional geometric model for segmentation and visualization of cervical spine images author pichumani ramani date february 1997 abstract this report introduces a new technique for automatically extracting vertebral segments from three dimensional computerized tomography ct and magnetic resonance mr images of the human cervical spine an important motivation for this work is to provide accurate information for registration and for fusion of ct and mr images into a composite three dimensional image one of the major hurdles in performing image fusion is the difficulty of extracting and matching corresponding anatomical regions in an accurate robust and timely manner the complementary properties of soft and bony tissues revealed in ct and mr imaging modalities makes it challenging to extract corresponding regions that can be correlated in an accurate and robust manner ambiguities in the images due to noise distortion limited resolution and patient specific structural variations also create additional challenges whereas fusion of ct and mr images of the cranium have already been performed no one has yet developed an automated technique for fusing multimodality images of the spine unlike the head which is relatively rigid the spine is a complex articulating object and is subject to structural deformation throughout the multimodal scanning process ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 97 1586 cs tr 97 1586 pdf
