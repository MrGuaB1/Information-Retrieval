report number cs tr 96 1577 institution stanford university department of computer science title a more aggressive use of views to extract information author huyn nam date december 1996 abstract much recent work has focussed on using views to evaluate queries more specifically queries are rewritten to refer to views instead of the base relations over which the queries were originally written the motivation is that the views represent the only ways in which some information source may be accessed another use of views that has been overlooked becomes important especially when no equivalent rewriting of a query in terms of views is possible even though we cannot use the views to get all the answers to the query we can still use them to deduce as many answers as possible in many global information applications the notion of equivalence used is often too restrictive we propose a notion of pseudo equivalence that allows more queries to be rewritten usefully we show that if a query has an equivalent rewriting the query also has a pseudo equivalent rewriting the converse is not true in general in particular when the views are conjunctive we show that all datalog queries over the source do have a pseudo equivalent datalog query over the views we reduce the problem of finding pseudo equivalent queries to that of rewriting horn queries with skolem functions as datalog queries we present an algorithm for the class of term bounded horn queries we discuss extending the problem to larger classes of horn queries other non horn queries that result from inverting datalog views and adding functional dependencies the theory and methods developed in our work have important uses in query mediation between heterogeneous sources automatic join discovery and view updates ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 96 1577 cs tr 96 1577 pdf
