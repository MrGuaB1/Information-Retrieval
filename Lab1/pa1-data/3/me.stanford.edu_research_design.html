research design stanford engineering intranet design is pervasive in mechanical engineering virtually all faculty members in the mechanical engineering department at stanford are involved in some form of design activity some actively design and manufacture devices or products others study the design process including team design and team learning a traditional strength in our design curriculum in addition we develop tools to facilitate the creation of engineering products at a variety of scales and complexity we interpret the word design widely reflecting the broad value systems we cultivate in the department we also believe that a better understanding of societal needs aided by association with social sciences will further assure the relevance of the fields we choose to work in where can you work on design the department's design group which contributes many faculty to the hasso plattner institute of design provides the nexus for the creation and understanding of successful design processes numerous faculty in the mechanics and computation group and the flow physics and computation group are developing the next generation of simulation capabilities for mechanical fluidic and biological systems in the thermosciences group there is much research on the design thermal and energy conversion systems ranging from thermoelectric and solar energy converters to clean coal finally there is a long tradition of the simulation characterization and design of biomedical structures in the biomechanical engineering program broadening the requirements envelope in the past design engineering's primary concern has been with feasibility our traditional and technically oriented approach to problem solving as we are asked to be more innovative in today's commercial industrial environment it becomes critical that we weigh in on usability viability and desirability as well the usability of products is obviously becoming more valued and requires us to focus much more strongly on human values in addition to technical requirements understanding the viability of the products and services we are responsible for creating requires better understanding of business principles in order to focus on appropriate solutions that will ensure that our designs will make it out into the world desirability requires an empathy for the social context and meaning of products human centered design the human centered design approach requires us to collaborate with and understand more fully the approach of social scientists in the cognitive psychology sociology and cultural anthropology fields our challenge and opportunity after developing expertise in the social sciences is to understand human values and needs to nearly the same extent that we understand technical and analytical issues this allows us to design products services and experiences that people truly value as individuals and as a culture the change to a human centered design methodology is quite profound instead of inspiration coming primarily from new technical advancements that we are trying to exploit we take the approach of studying and observing humans to understand their wants and latent needs we are therefore able to design a more appropriately satisfying solution that makes a difference related topics me department groups biomechanical engineering design flow physics and computational engineering mechanics and computation thermosciences design teamwork the project in the image above required student teams to design and build a paper bicycle to fit certain given requirements and performance criteria students collaborated in teams and developed an understanding of the true requirements for a successful design in the course of their attempts to build a successful paper bicycle their efforts yielded innovative approaches and provided first hand experience in the discovery element of design processes that result in good products stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni themes that define us groups & programs faculty & research faculty directory affiliate programs faculty lookup by topic faculty open positions laboratories research centers ahpcrc cdr cits ctr research profiles research projects admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
