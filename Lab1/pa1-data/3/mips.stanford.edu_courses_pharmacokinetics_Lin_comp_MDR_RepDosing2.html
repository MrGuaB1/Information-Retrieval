kinetics of drug absorption derivative of rxtracmaxmin kinetics of drug absorption most routes of drug administration depend upon the drug dissolving into body fluids and diffusing through one or more membranes to enter the blood plasma therefore all routes of administration except intravenous are classified as extravascular routes drug absorption is defined as the appearance of the drug in plasma oral administration is the most common extravascular route administration of this form either by solution or by rapidly dissolving solids ie pills often obey first order kinetics absorption is characterized by evaluating the absorption rate constant k a from plasma concentration versus time data graphs a kinetic model of first order absorption is written where d g drug at the absorption site gut d b drug in the body d e eliminated drug k a first order absorption rate constant k el overall elimination rate constant the differential equations describing the rates of change of the three components d g d b and d e are 1 dd g dt k a d g 2 dd b dt k a d g k el d b 3 dd e dt k el d b integrating eq 1 we get d g d g o exp k a t where d g o is the initial amount of drug presented to the absorbing region of the gut the d g o is equal to the dosage administered if the absorption is complete by substitution we obtain dd b dt k a d g o exp k a t k el d b using laplace transforms our equation becomes where d g o k a k a k el represents the amount of drug in the body through extravascular administration the two exponential terms represent elimination exp k el t and absorption exp k a t of the drug by dividing both sides by v d which is the apparent volume of distribution we obtain the concentration of the drug within plasma versus time b 7b
