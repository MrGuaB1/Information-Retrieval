abiteboul abstract querying and updating structured files dr serge abiteboul inria on leave at stanford university email abitebou db stanford edu abstract database systems are concerned with structured data unfortunately data is still often available in an unstructured manner eg in files even when it does have a strong internal structure eg data exchange formats such as sgml or asn 1 electronic documents or programs we are concerned with specifying logical views of such data and with querying and updating these views a logical view is specified using a context free grammar giving the syntax of the file and some annotations in a logical language this provides a semantics for queries we show how queries can be evaluated without having to reconstruct entirely the view this notably uses known query rewriting techniques adapted to our context when an update is specified on a logical view of a file determining its effect on the file is an intricate issue indeed it is undecidable in general we consider restricted cases that allow unexpensive translation of updates this is based on deriving correspondences between vertices in the parse tree of the file and the graph of the database this is based on joint work with sophie cluet and tova milo copy of slides
