report number cs tr 85 1087 institution stanford university department of computer science title preemptable remote execution facilities for the v system author theimer marvin m author lantz keith a author cheriton david r date september 1985 abstract a remote execution facility allows a user of a workstation based distributed system to offload programs onto idle workstations thereby providing the user with access to computational resources beyond that provided by his personal workstation in this paper we describe the design and performance of the remote execution facility in the v distributed system as well as several implementation issues of interest in particular we focus on network transparency of the execution environment preemption and migration of remotely executed programs and avoidance of residual dependencies on the original host we argue that preemptable remote execution allows idle workstations to be used aa pool of processors without interfering with use by their owners and without significant overhead for the normal execution of programs in general we conclude that the cost of providing preemption is modest compared to providing a similar amount of computation service by dedicated computation engines ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 85 1087 cs tr 85 1087 pdf
