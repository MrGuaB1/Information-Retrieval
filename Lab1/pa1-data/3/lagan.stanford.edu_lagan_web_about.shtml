lagan about us home about pairwise lagan multi lagan shuffle lagan citing and download authors about the lagan toolkit the lagan tookit consists of four components chaos chaos is a pairwise local aligner optimized for non coding and other poorly conserved regions of the genome it uses both exact matching and degenerate seeds and is able to find homology in the presence of gaps lagan lagan is our highly parametrizable pairwise global alignment program it takes local alignments generated by chaos as anchors and limits the search area of the needleman wunsch algorithm around these anchors multi lagan multi lagan is a generalization of the pairwise algorithm to multiple sequence alignment m lagan performs progressive pairwise alignments guided by a user specified phylogenetic tree alignments are aligned to other alignments using the sum of pairs metric shuffle lagan shuffle lagan is a novel glocal alignment algorithm that is able to find rearrangements inversions transpositions and some duplications in a global alignment framework it uses chaos local alignments to build a map of the rearrangements between the sequences and lagan to align the regions of conserved synteny
