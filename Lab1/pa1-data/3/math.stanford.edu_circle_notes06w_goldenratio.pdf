the golden ratio page 1 stanford math circle the golden ratio sam vandervelde january 22 2006 today we explored just a few of the many remarkable properties of the number  1 2 1 5 the golden ratio this constant satisfies the equation 2  1 the fundamental algebraic property of the golden ratio this equation looks similar to the recurrence relation defining the fibonacci numbers so it should come as no surprise to discover that there is a close connection between the two as outlined in some of the problems below 1 write 7 8 as a single power of  now do the same for  7  8 careful the answer is not  9 also try writing 5 3 24 2 and 26 37 as a single power of  2 it is a beautiful fact that every positive integer can be written in exactly one way as a sum of distinct non consecutive powers of  a verify that 1 0 2   2 and 3 2  2 b find ways to write 4 and 5 as a sum distinct non consecutive powers of  c challenge prove this fact 3 use a calculator to compute the value of n 5 for n 1 to 10 what do you notice 4 recall that  is a solution to the equation x2 x 1 since this equation is a quadratic it has two roots which we will call  and  find the values of  and  in radical form then show that   1 and  1 5 the fibonacci numbers are defined by setting f0 0 f1 1 and fn 1 fn fn 1 for all n 1 binet's formula for the fibonacci numbers states that fn n n 5 a verify that the formula works for n 0 1 and 2 b prove that the formula is valid for all n by induction c use the formula to explain the observation you made above concerning n 5 6 the binet formula provides a handy alternate method for proving identities involving fibonacci numbers the relations   1 and  1 verified above will come in handy here use the formula to establish that a fn 2 fn 2 3fn b fn 2fn 2 f2 n 1 can you predict when to use 1 or 1 c f2 n 1 f2 n 1 f2n c challenge f3 n 1 f3 n f3 n 1 f3n
