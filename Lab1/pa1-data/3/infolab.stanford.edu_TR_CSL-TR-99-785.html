report number csl tr 99 785 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title checkpointing apparatus and algorithms for fault tolerant tightly coupled multiprocessors author sunada dwight date july 1999 abstract the apparatus and algorithms for establishing checkpoints on a tightly coupled multiprocessor tcmp fall naturally into three broad classes tightly synchronized method loosely synchronized method and unsynchronized method the algorithms in the class of the tightly synchronized method force the immediate establishment of a checkpoint whenever a dependency between two processors arises the algorithms in the class of the loosely synchronized method record this dependency and hence do not require the immediate establishment of a checkpoint if a dependency does arise when a processor chooses to establish a checkpoint the processor will query the dependency records to determine other processors that must also establish a checkpoint the algorithms in the class of the unsynchronized method allow a processor to establish a checkpoint without regard to any other processor within this framework we develop four apparatus and algorithms distributed recoverable shared memory drsm drsm for communication checkpoints drsm c drsm with half of the memory drsm h and drsm with logs drsm l drsm c is an algorithm in the class of the tightly synchronized method and drsm and drsm h are algorithms in the class of the loosely synchronized method drsm l is an algorithm in the class of the unsynchronized method and is the first of its kind for a tcmp drsm l has the best performance in terms of minimizing the impact of establishing checkpoints or logs on the running applications and has the least expensive hardware ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 99 785 csl tr 99 785 pdf
