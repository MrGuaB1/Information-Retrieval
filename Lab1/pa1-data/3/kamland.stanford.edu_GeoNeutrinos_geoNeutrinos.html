geoneutrino investigation with kamland geoneutrino investigation with kamland stanford university website kamland logo the left half shows the simulated production distribution for the geoneutrinos detectable with kamland and the right half shows the earth structure geoneutrino results is published in the july 28 issue of nature magazine click here for the geoneutrino results geoneutrinos are electron antineutrinos produced by beta decays of the nuclei in the decay chains of 238 u and 232 th kamland is the first detector to conduct an investigation on geoneutrinos geophysics this image is taken from here the earth can be split into 5 basic regions according to the seismic data core mantle oceanic crust continental crust and sediment all these regions are solid except for the outer core even though the mantle is solid it convects the mantle convection is responsible for the terrestrial phenomena such as plate tectonics and earthquakes the oceanic crust is renewed at mid ocean ridges and recycled back into the mantle at subduction zones so the typical oceanic crust 80 million years old is much younger than the continental crust 2 billion years old heat flow measurement from the earth this image is taken from here the earth's conductive heat flow has been evaluated to be 44.2 tw or 31tw with an assumption of lower hydrothermal heat flow near mid ocean ridges these evaluations use borehole temperature gradient and conductivity measurements these borehole measurements are concentrated in the us europe and japan the deepest borehole is 12km 1 500 of the earth's radius radiogenic heat in the earth the radioactive isotopes inside the earth generate heat in particular decays of the daughter nuclei in the decay chains of 238 u and 232 th and 40 k generate most of the radiogenic heat produced according to the estimated concentrations of these isotopes described below the radiogenic heat production rates are 8.0 8.3 and 3tw for 238 u series 232 th series and 40 k decays respectively the sum of the estimated radiogenic heat production rate 19tw is only about the half of the total heat flow measured using the borehole measurements according to some of the mantle convection models these two numbers 44tw or 31tw for the total heat dissipation rate from the earth and 19tw for radiogenic heat production rate should be similar as these radioactive isotopes beta decay they produce antineutrinos so measuring these antineutrinos may serve as a crosscheck of the radiogenic heat production rate reference earth model according to the measurements of the concentrations of u and th in the chondritic meteorites the concentration mass ratio of th to u inside the earth is believed to be 3.9 the core of the earth high density alloy of fe and ni is believed to be highly incompatible with isotopes with high atomic weight such as u and th therefore we assume that u and th are absent from the core as the earth formed mantle crystallized outward from core mantle boundary u and th prefer to enter a melt phase so we assume the continental crust and continental sediment have the highest u and th concentrations gratta group homepage this page is maintained by kazumi tolich
