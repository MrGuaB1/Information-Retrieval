math 122 project page 1 math 122 project due may 20 2011 i will grade this myself rules you may discuss this with me or with other students in the class however you may not show anyone your written work check the web page occasionally since there could be corrections or added hints if a is a matrix i will denote its transpose by ta problem 1 column orthogonality let g be a finite group and 1 h the irreducible characters let 1 h be representatives of the conjugacy classes and let ni be the number of elements of g in the conjugacy class of i a remind me why ni g cg i is the index of the centralizer of i b if 1 i j h let uij i j cg gj show that u uij is a unitary matrix that is u tu i where tu is the complex con jugate of the transpose of u c remind me why the transpose of a unitary matrix is also unitary using the fact that tu is unitary prove that if   g then i 1 h i  i  cg  if  and  are conjugate 0 otherwise illustrate this with an example for example with s3 problem 2 frobenius schur indicators let g be a finite group and consider a representation for convenience to avoid having to introduce tensors we will consider an irreducible matrix representation  g gl n c let v matn c which is a vector space of dimension n2 define a representation  g gl v by  g x  g x t g x matn c the frobenius schur indicator   of g where  is the character of  is defined by   1 g g g  g2 the purpose of this problem is to deduce some of the remarkable properties of this indi cator a show that v contains two invariant subspaces v x x tx v x x tx the spaces of symmetric and skew symmetric matrices if 1 n are the eigenvalues of the matrix  g show that the eigenvalues of  g on v are ij i j 1 page 2 and the eigenvalues of  g on v are ij i j therefore if  and  are the characters of the representations of g on v and v then  g i  j ij  g i j ij b show that  g  g  g 2 and  g  g  g2 c show that 1 g g g  g 2 1 if  is real valued 0 otherwise d show that if  is not real valued then   0 while if  is real valued then   1 e let g be a group in which   1 for all irreducible characters  for example symmetric groups are known to have this property let 1 h be the irreducible characters of g show that i 1 h i 1 is the number of elements t g such that t2 1 hint write this as i 1 h i 1  i or perhaps better i 1 h i 1  i try to find a way to use column orthogonality you might be able to give a similar interpretation for i 1 h i g where g is an arbitrary element of g
