report number csl tr 98 772 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title designing a partitionable multiplier author lee hyuk jun author flynn michael date october 1998 abstract this report presents the design of a 64 bit integer multiplier core that can perform 32 bit or 16 bit parallel integer multiplications pmul and 32 bit or 16 bit parallel integer multiplications followed by additions pmadd the proposed multiplier removes sign and constant bits from its core and projects them to the boundaries to minimize the complexity of base cells it also adopts an array of arrays architecture with unequal array sizes by decoupling partial product generation from carry save addition this makes it possible to achieve high speed for 64 bit multiplication two architectures which are done in dual rail domino are tested for functionality in verilog and simulated in hspice for tsmc 0.35 um process the first architecture is capable of both pmul and pmadd the estimated delay is 4.9 ns excluding a final adder at 3.3 v supply and 25c and its estimated area is 6.5 mm 2 the estimated delay of the second architecture only capable of pmul is 4.5 ns its estimated area is 5.2 mm 2 ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 98 772 csl tr 98 772 pdf
