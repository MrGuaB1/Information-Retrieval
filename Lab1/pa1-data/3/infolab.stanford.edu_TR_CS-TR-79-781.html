report number cs tr 79 781 institution stanford university department of computer science title exploring the use of domain knowledge for query processing efficiency author king jonathan j date december 1979 abstract an approach to query optimization is described that draws on two sources of knowledge real world constraints on the values for the application domain served by the database and knowledge about the current structure of the database and the cost of available retrieval processes real world knowledge is embodied in rules that are much like semantic integrity rules the approach called query rephrasing is to generate semantic equivalents of user queries that cost less to process than the original queries the operation of a prototype system based on this approach is discussed in the context of simple queries which restrict a single file the need for heuristics to limit the generation of equivalent queries is also discussed and a method using constraint thresholds derived from a model of the retrieval process is proposed ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 79 781 cs tr 79 781 pdf
