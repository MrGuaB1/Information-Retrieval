biomedicine stanford engineering intranet biomedicine 00 00 where mechanics and biomedicine meet with over 200 medical device companies within twenty miles and three top tier hospitals within walking distance the stanford campus provides a unique setting for medical innovation many faculty and students working are student biomechanical engineering and developing a combination of strong mechanical skills with a working understanding of biological and or medical systems and processes investigations range from exploring how proteins fold and interact to designing the next generation of medical equipment and joint replacements biomechanical engineering research encompasses not only fundamental scientific questions but also the endeavors which will bring discoveries to hospitals clinics and society as a whole to improve general health well being and quality of life the biomechanical engineering program is central to the department's efforts in exploring the mechanics biomedicine interface and developing innovative solutions for this rapidly growing area in addition many students working in all of the mechanical engineering groups design thermosciences flow physics and computation and mechanics and computation have substantial research efforts in the area of biological systems modeling & simulation exploration mathematical and computational models are required to understand the extreme complexity of living systems creating models with sufficient complexity to replicate these systems is a difficult challenge but can provide insight into problems which would otherwise not be possible new computational methods and programs are often required to model and simulate these systems the department features a broad variety of computational research dedicated to biological systems ranging from the study of molecular and dna transport to simulations of bloodflow in organs and the mechanics of joints and body mechanics medical device design research projects and coursework within the biomechanical engineering program aid in the effort to create the next generation of medical devices often partnering with local medical device companies taking ideas from concept to clinical device is critical for continuing to improve health care and patient quality of life collaboration for innovation the success of biomedical pursuits depends upon close collaboration and cooperation between a broad team of physicians engineers scientists and therapists only through tight teamwork can the complex systems be explored and understood the biomechanical engineering program plays a key role in extending an open hand to all of these communities and an open environment for collaboration to occur engineers with expertise in biology mechanics computation and the design process are protagonists in many local corporations and hospitals the ongoing interaction with these corporations is a key strength of the biomechanical engineering program and the mechanical engineering department as a whole groups and programs biomechanical engineering design flow physics and computational engineering mechanics and computation thermosciences soft tissue biomechanics the focus of the soft tissue biomechanics laboratory is on the function degeneration and regeneration of articular cartilage and fibrocartilage with an emphasis on understanding the complex interactions between biophysical and biochemical cues in controlling cell behavior more stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni themes that define us groups & programs faculty & research faculty directory affiliate programs faculty lookup by topic faculty open positions laboratories research centers ahpcrc cdr cits ctr research profiles research projects admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
