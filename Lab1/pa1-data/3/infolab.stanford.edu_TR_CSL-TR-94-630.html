report number csl tr 94 630 institution stanford university department of computer science title expansion caches for superscalar processors author johnson john d date june 1994 abstract superscalar implementations present increased demands on instruction caches as well as instruction decoding and issuing mechanisms leading to very complex hardware requirements this work proposes utilizing an expanded instruction cache to reduce and simplify the complexity of hardware required to implement a superscalar machine trace driven simulation is used for evaluating the presented expanded parallel instruction cache epic machine and its performance is found to be comparable to a dynamically scheduled superscalar model ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 94 630 csl tr 94 630 pdf
