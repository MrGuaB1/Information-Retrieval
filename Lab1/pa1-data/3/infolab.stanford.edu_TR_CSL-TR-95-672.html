report number csl tr 95 672 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title delay models for cmos circuits author mcfarland grant author flynn michael date june 1995 abstract four different cmos inverter delay models are derived and compared it is shown that inverter delay can be estimated with fair accuracy over a wide range of input rise times and loads as the sum of two terms one proportional to the input rise time and one proportional to the capacitive load methods for estimating device capacitance from hspice parameters are presented as well as means of including added delay due to wire resistance and the use of series transistors ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 95 672 csl tr 95 672 pdf
