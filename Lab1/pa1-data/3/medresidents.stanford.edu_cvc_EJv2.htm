external jugular anatomy the external jugular vein ej begins at the angle of the mandible and courses to the middle of the clavicle at the posterior border of the sterocleidomastoid figure 1 the ej is formed by the junction of the posterior division of the posterior facial with the posterior auricular vein and drains into the subclavian vein figure 2 positioning and technique rotate the patient's neck away from the ej stretching the vein to reduce rolling place the patient in trendelenburg to increase venous distention thereby facilitating placement and to decrease the risk of air embolism video 1 other techniques to enhance ej visualization include 1 having the patient perform a vasalva maneuver 2 compressing the proximal ej near the clavicle prior to catheter insertion figure 3 enter the vein high in the neck and maintain a shallow angle 5 10 when puncturing the skin as the ej is a very superficial vein using a short catheter can facilitate the required shallow approach troubleshooting failure to cannulate frequently if no flashback is observed the needle has passed too deep withdraw the needle and attempt a more shallow approach failure to thread the catheter valves may obstruct full insertion to successfully pass the catheter first withdraw the angiocatheter until venous blood flow returns once flow has been established attach the catheter to iv tubing and then slowly advance the catheter while iv fluids are running figure 1 ej superficial anatomy source http medicine ucsd edu clinicalimg head ejdistension2 jpg figure 2 ej anatomy source http www aic cuhk edu hk web8 internal_jugular_vein htm figure 3 visualizing the ej via proximal compression near the clavicle source http xnet kp org permanentejournal winter03 heart html video 1 visualizing the ej by placing patient in trendelenburg source supplement to arch intern med 2006 166 2132 2137
