mechanics and computation structural mechanics of viral shells stretching continuum models to their limits stanford mechanics and computation home people research teaching seminar schedule faq william klug ph d structural mechanics of viral shells stretching continuum models to their limits as revealed by techniques of structural biology the protein shells of viruses capsids are some of nature's most beautiful and robust examples of highly symmetric multiscale self assembled structures the ability of viral capsids to respond structurally and mechanically to physical and chemical stimuli also gives them tremendous potential as components for the design of synthetic materials with adaptive properties as has been demonstrated by the creation of virus based nanowires a series of recent indentation experiments using atomic force microscopy afm has shown that capsids also possess impressive mechanical properties of strength and elasticity in this talk i will present some analytical and numerical models of viral capsids based on continuum mechanics and ginzburg landau theory and i will discuss what we ve learned about 1 the elastic response and mechanical failure of viral capsids 2 coupling of global capsid mechanical response to local protein conformational change and 3 the role of mechanics in capsid self assembly lastly i will describe our ongoing efforts to push the limits of usefulness of continuum theory via coupled continuum atomistic multiscale modeling of capsids and other large protein assemblies retrieved from http mc stanford edu cgi bin index php title structural_mechanics_of_viral_shells _stretching_continuum_models_to_their_limits&oldid 2525 member login log in page discussion view source history what links here related changes upload file special pages editing instructions
