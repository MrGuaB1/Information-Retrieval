report number cs tn 98 62 institution stanford university department of computer science title a type system for object initialization in the java bytecode language author freund stephen n author mitchell john c date april 1998 abstract in the standard java implementation a java language program is compiled to java bytecode this bytecode may be sent across the network to another site where it is then interpreted by the java virtual machine since bytecode may be written by hand or corrupted during network transmission the java virtual machine contains a bytecode verifier that performs a number of consistency checks before code is interpreted as illustrated by previous attacks on the java virtual machine these tests which include type correctness are critical for system security in order to analyze existing bytecode verifiers and to understand the properties that should be verified we develop a precise specification of statically correct java bytecode in the form of a type system our focus in this paper is a subset of the bytecode language dealing with object creation and initialization for this subset we prove that for every java bytecode program that satisfies our typing constraints every object is initialized before it is used the type system is easily combined with a previous system developed by stata and abadi for bytecode subroutines our analysis of subroutines and object initialization reveals a previously unpublished bug in the sun jdk bytecode verifier ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tn 98 62 cs tn 98 62 pdf
