report number cs tr 78 693 institution stanford university department of computer science title a class of solutions to the gossip problem author west douglas b date november 1978 abstract we characterize and count optimal solutions to the gossip problem in which no one hears his own information that is we consider graphs with n vertices where the edges have a linear ordering such that an increasing path exists from each vertex to every other but there is no increasing path from any vertex to itself such graphs exist only when n is even in which case the fewest number of edges is 2n 4 as in the original gossip problem we characterize optimal solutions of this sort noho graphs using a correspondence with a set of permutations and binary sequences this correspondence enables us to count these solutions and several subclasses of solutions the numbers of solutions in each class are simple powers of 2 and 3 with exponents determined by n we also show constructively that noho graphs are planar and hamiltonian and we mention applications to related problems ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 78 693 cs tr 78 693 pdf
