bayesian analysis for the social sciences simon jackman bayesian analysis for the social sciences ipsa summer school sao paulo february 2012 this class provides a practical introduction to bayesian statistical inference with an emphasis on applications in the social sciences we will begin slowly with a consideration of how bayesian statistical inference differs from classical or frequentist inference we will examine these differences in the context of simple statistical procedures and models eg one and two sample t tests the analysis of a two by two tables one way anova regression we then show how the explosion in desktop computing power since the 1990s has made bayesian approaches attractive for more complex models specifically the set of algorithms known as markov chain monte carlo mcmc allows researchers to tackle classes of problems that used to fall in the too hard basket today mcmc is well and truly part of the statistical computing toolkit available to social scientists and implemented in various forms in many different software packages we will survey some of these see below we will examine how these algorithms make bayesian inference feasible their strengths and weaknesses and some of the pitfalls to avoid when deploying mcmc algorithms text we will use my text bayesian analysis for the social sciences wiley 2009 amazon please consult the errata last changed on march 5 2012 and let me know if you see any more errors typos etc announcements class material syllabus time last changed 9 17 pm january 8 2012 introduction chapter 1 time last changed 3 05 pm february 4 2012 conjugate bayesian analysis time last changed 5 21 am february 11 2012 bayesian regression analysis the monte carlo principle time last changed 6 09 pm february 3 2012 markov chain monte carlo time last changed 1 18 am february 8 2012 practical markov chain monte carlo time last changed 6 13 pm february 3 2012 hierarchical models time last changed 10 10 am february 11 2012 discrete choice data time last changed 6 13 pm february 3 2012 bayesian inference for latent states time last changed 6 13 pm february 3 2012 worked examples the rjags r package brazilian legislative roll call data analysis in ideal r code rdata object monte carlo analysis difference of two binomial proportions r jags regression with posterior predictive density election fraud in pennsylvania state senate election r jags multivariate t regression for compositional data example 6.9 uk house of commons r data rda save to your computer read into r with load ukhouseofcommons rda jags write up pdf blocking example example 6.3 r jags faster blocked jags slower unblocked missing data example poking holes in the electoral fraud data set r jags one way anova presidential elections data r jags one way hierarchical model high school and beyond data data set 1 data set 2 data reader r set for jags r jags iraq war use of force authorization in the us senate r jags rock the vote analysis r jags ordinal logistic model political information r jags ordinal logistic model with hierarchical structure random effects for interviewers jags factor analysis social attributes of the 50 american states r jags hierarchical version of factor analysis model 9.2 5 jags analysis of roll calls from the 110th us senate pdf hierarchical version of the roll call model example 9.2 jags
