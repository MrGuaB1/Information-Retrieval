clouddb a data store for all sizes in the cloud hakan hacigumus nec labs america clouddb project which is underway at nec labs america aims at creating a comprehensive data management platform in the cloud the envisioned platform would provide data management capabilities as a service to transparently and efficiently support diverse application workloads with identifiable sla guarantees and end to end system management functions the system will be able to employ heterogonous underlying storage models to effectively meet applications query and scalability requirements we propose the achievement of data independence for all underlying specific storage models as the key guiding principle for the system if the system is able to achieve data independence the application logic is decoupled from the data processing logic and allows applications to enjoy the benefits of individual storage models which are optimized for particular purposes without worrying about the specifics of data processing this talk will describe the vision and our rationale for why such a system is needed and desirable we will also highlight some significant challenges to the realization of such a system
