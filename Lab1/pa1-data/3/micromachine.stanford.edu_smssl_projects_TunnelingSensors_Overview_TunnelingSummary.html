brief summary of tunneling sensors our basic tunneling sensor electron tunneling occurs when electrons cross a narrow energy barrier for our sensor this barrier is caused by maintaining two metallic electrodes a small distance apart the membrane and tip are held roughly 10 angstroms apart when the sensor is operating properly the sensor is constructed with roughly 1 micron of separation between the membrane and tip to pull the membrane close enough to enable tunneling currents an electrostatic force is created by applying a large voltage 100s of volts between the membrane and the deflection electrodes an external circuit controls this deflection voltage to maintain a constant tunneling current for our sensor a tunneling current of approximately 1 na occurs when the separation distance is about 10 angstroms and we apply 175 mv between the membrane and tip since this system balances the forces on the membrane to keep the current and therefore separation distance constant we can measure the external forces on the membrane by measuring the force the controller applies to balance these external forces so to measure different phenomena we need to make these phenomena apply forces on the membrane we ve successfully built an ir sensor and we are looking into accelerometers and magnetometers download a more detailed paper about the physics of the sensor word 5.1 250k download a more detailed paper about the physics of the sensor rtf photos of tunneling sensors tunneling sensors home page smssl home page comments
