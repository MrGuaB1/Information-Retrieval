a language and system for composing megamodules a language and system for composing autonomous heterogeneous and distributed megamodules dorothea beringer catherine tornabene pankash jain and gio wiederhold dexa international workshop on large scale software composition vienna austria august 28 1998 full paper ps full text html new levels of software composition become possible through advances in distributed communication services in this paper we focus on the composition of megamodules which are large distributed components or computation servers that are autonomously operated and maintained the composition of megamodules offers various challenges megamodules are not necessarily all accessible by the same distribution protocol such as corba dcom rmi and dce their concurrent nature and potentially long duration of service execution necessitates asynchronous invocation and collection of results novel needs and opportunities for optimization arise when composing megamodules in order to meet these challenges we have defined a purely compositional language called chaims and are now developing the architecture supporting this language in this paper we describe chaims and how it meets the challenges of composing megamodules
