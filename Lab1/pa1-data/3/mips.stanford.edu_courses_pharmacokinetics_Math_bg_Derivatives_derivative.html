e_the derivative the derivation since e is a constant and the derivative of any constant is 0 we will consider taking the derivative of e x its derivative is as follows what does this mean we see the graph of e x is the derivative of a function enables us to find the slope of any point of that function for example if f x x 2 then dy dx 2x is the slope of the curve at any point x here we see that if x 1 then the slope also the tangent of the curve at a given point is two if x 2 then the slope will be 4 and so on according to y 2x getting back to how this affects e x we find that the derivative of e x is also e x the graphs of which are identical
