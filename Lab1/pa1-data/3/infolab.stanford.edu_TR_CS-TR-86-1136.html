report number cs tr 86 1136 institution stanford university department of computer science title an experiment in knowledge based signal understanding using parallel architectures author brown harold author schoen eric author delagi bruce date october 1986 abstract this report documents an experiment investigating the potential of a parallel computing architecture to enhance the performance of a knowledge based signal understanding system the experiment consisted of implementing and evaluating an application encoded in a parallel programming extension of lisp and executing on a simulated multiprocessor system the chosen application for the experiment was a knowledge based system for interpreting pre processed passively acquired radar emissions from aircraft the application was implemented in an experimental concurrent asynchronous object oriented framework this framework in turn relied on the services provided by the underlying hardware system the hardware system for the experiment was a simulation of various sized grids of processors with inter processor communication via message passing the experiment investigated the effects of various high level control strategies on the quality of the problem solution the speedup of the overall system performance as a function of the number of processors in the grid and some of the issues in implementing and debugging a knowledge based system on a message passing multiprocessor system in this report we describe the software and simulated hardware components of the experiment and present the qualitative and quantitative experimental results ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 86 1136 cs tr 86 1136 pdf
