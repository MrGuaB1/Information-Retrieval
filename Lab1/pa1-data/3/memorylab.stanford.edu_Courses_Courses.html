stanford memory laboratory courses cognitive psychology psych 40 winter 2004 introduction to learning and memory psych 45 spring 2010 spring 2009 spring 2008 spring 2007 spring 2006 spring 2005 other than that which is genetically coded everything we know is derived from and reflects memory for our past this course provides an introductory survey of the literature on learning and memory including consideration of the cognitive and neural organization of memory mechanisms of remembering and forgetting and the nature of false memories cognitive theory and behavioral evidence will be integrated with data from patient studies and functional brain imaging cortical plasticity in perception and memory psych 206 winter 2009 this advanced seminar will focus on topics related to cortical plasticity in perceptual and memory systems topics will include neural bases of implicit memory recognition memory visual priming and perceptual learning emphasis will be placed on reviewing recent research with an interdisciplinary scope including discussion of theory behavioral findings neural mechanisms and computational models co taught with prof kalanit grill spector foundations of memory psych 210 fall 2009 fall 2007 fall 2006 fall 2005 fall 2004 memory is intimately involved in most if not all levels of human cognition from the ability to temporarily remember a phone number or where you placed your keys to the acquisition of language and the ability to reason behavioral and neural data indicate that memory is not a unitary faculty but rather consists of multiple systems that support learning and remembering each with its own processing characteristics and neurobiological substrates this lecture course will provide an advanced survey of what is known about memory placing an emphasis on understanding the cognitive and neural architectures of working memory declarative memory and nondeclarative memory models and mechanisms of memory psych 226 fall 2008 current topics in memory will be explored through computational models addressing experimental findings and physiological and behavioral investigations topics include explicit and implicit learning role of mtl structures in learning and memory and single versus dual processes approaches to recognition co taught with prof jay mcclelland current debates in learning and memory psych 266 winter 2009 winter 2007 spring 2004 declarative memory supports the conscious remembrance of past experience including the ability to discriminate novel from familiar stimuli and to recollect details about a prior encounter with a stimulus this seminar will consider current debates regarding the cognitive and neural architecture of declarative memory specifically focusing on recent efforts to address these controversies through application of functional neuroimaging primarily fmri and eeg through readings of conceptual seed articles and group discussion of neuroimaging investigations the aim is to provide a forum in which new empirical efforts to address these debates may emerge there are no prerequisites for this course though a working understanding of memory and neuroimaging methods will prove useful selected topics in cognitive control psych 279 winter 2008 winter 2005 cognitive control refers to processes that enable flexible behavior by biasing contextually relevant perceptual mnemonic and response representations or processing pathways cognitive control is central to volitional action allowing us to work with memory represent task goal states and override competing inappropriate responses this seminar will consider formal models of cognitive control with group discussion focusing on how the models account for behavioral functional neuroimaging neuropsychological and neurophysiological evidence regarding the nature of cognitive control stanford continuing studies program spring 2004
