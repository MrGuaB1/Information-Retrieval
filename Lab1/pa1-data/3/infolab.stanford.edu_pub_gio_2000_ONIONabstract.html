mwm onion abstract a graph oriented model for articulation of ontology prasenjit mitra gio wiederhold and martin kersten accepted for extending database technologies edbt 2000 konstanz germany march 2000 stanford csl tn 99 411 full paper pdf ontologies are knowledge structures to explicate the contents essential properties and relationships between terms in a knowledge source many sources are now accessible with associated ontologies most prior work on use of ontologies relies on the construction of a single global ontology covering all sources such an approach is not scalable and maintainable especially when the sources change frequently we propose a scalable and easily maintainable approach based on the interoperation of ontologies to handle user queries crossing the boundaries of the underlying information systems the interoperation between the ontologies should be precisely defined our approach is to use rules that cross the semantic gap by creating an articulation or linkage between the systems the rules are generated using a semi automatic articulation tool with the help of a domain expert to make the ontologies amenable for automatic composition based on the accumulated knowledge rules we represent them using a graph oriented model extended with a small algebraic operator set onion a user friendly toolkit aids the experts in bridging the semantic gap in real life settings our framework provides a sound foundation to simplify the work of domain experts enables integration with public semantic dictionaries like wordnet and will derive odmg compliant mediators automatically
