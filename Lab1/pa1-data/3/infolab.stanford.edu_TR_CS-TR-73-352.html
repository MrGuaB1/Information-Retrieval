report number cs tr 73 352 institution stanford university department of computer science title the expected difference between the sltf and mtpt drum scheduling disciplines digest edition author fuller samuel h date august 1972 abstract this report is a sequel to an earlier report fuller 1971 that develops a minimal total processing time mtpt drum scheduling algorithm a quantitative comparison between mtpt schedules and shortest latency time first sltf schedules commonly acknowledged as good schedules for drum like storage units is presented here the analysis develops an analogy to random walks and proves several asymptotic properties of collections of records on drums these properties are specialized to the mtpt and sltf algorithms and it is shown that for sufficiently large sets of records the expected processing time of a sltf schedule is longer than a mtpt schedule by the expected record length the results of a simulation study are also presented to show the difference in mtpt and sltf schedules for small sets of records and for situations not covered in the analytic discussion ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 73 352 cs tr 73 352 pdf
