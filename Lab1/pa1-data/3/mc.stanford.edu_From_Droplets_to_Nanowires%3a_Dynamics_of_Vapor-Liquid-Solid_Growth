mechanics and computation from droplets to nanowires dynamics of vapor liquid solid growth stanford mechanics and computation home people research teaching seminar schedule faq klaus w schwarz ibm tj watson research center from droplets to nanowires dynamics of vapor liquid solid growth semiconductor nanowires can be grown through a process in which a liquid eutectic droplet at the tip of the wire captures material from a vapor and deposits it at the wire tip this vapor liquid solid process can be utilized to construct nanoscale electronic devices and has therefore become a topic of intense experimental study the experiments have revealed a complex range of behaviors one that is not adequately addressed by the relatively simple quasi equilibrium models currently available this talk will present a new continuum model of reactive droplet dynamics developed to describe nanowire growth more realistically the predictions of the model with respect to isotropic growth catalyst diffusion and coarsening faceted growth and so on will be explored for the case of a two dimensional droplet even for this simplified system many of the experimentally observed phenomena seem to arise naturally from the model if time permits possible extensions of the model to other interesting systems will be discussed retrieved from http mc stanford edu cgi bin index php title from_droplets_to_nanowires _dynamics_of_vapor liquid solid_growth&oldid 1749 member login log in page discussion view source history what links here related changes upload file special pages editing instructions
