report number cs tr 99 1623 institution stanford university department of computer science title efficient maintenance and recovery of data warehouses author labio wilburt juan date august 1999 abstract data warehouses collect data from multiple remote sources and integrate the information as materialized views in a local database the materialized views are used to answer queries that analyze the collected data for patterns and trends this type of query processing is often called on line analytical processing olap the warehouse views must be updated when changes are made to the remote information sources otherwise the answers to olap queries are based on stale data answering olap queries based on stale data is clearly a problem especially if olap queries are used to support critical decisions made by the organization that owns the data warehouse because the primary purpose of the data warehouse is to answer olap queries only a limited amount of time and or resources can be devoted to the warehouse update hence we have developed new techniques to ensure that the warehouse update can be done efficiently also the warehouse update is not devoid of failures since only a limited amount of time and or resources are devoted to the warehouse update it is most likely infeasible to restart the warehouse update from scratch thus we have developed new techniques for resuming failed warehouse updates finally warehouse updates typically transfer gigabytes of data into the warehouse although the price of disk storage is decreasing there will be a point in the lifetime of a data warehouse when keeping and administering all of the collected is unreasonable thus we have investigated techniques for reducing the storage cost of a data warehouse by selectively expiring information that is not needed ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 99 1623 cs tr 99 1623 pdf
