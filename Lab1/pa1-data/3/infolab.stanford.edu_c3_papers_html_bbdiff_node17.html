computing a min cost edge cover next up previous next implementation and performance up finding the edge cover previous pruning rules computing a min cost edge cover after application of the pruning rules described above we obtain a pruned induced graph containing a typically small subset of the edges in the original induced graph in favorable cases the remaining edges contain only one minimal edge cover however typically there may be several minimal edge covers possible for the pruned induced graph we now describe how we select one of these minimal edge covers we first approximate the fair cost of every edge e that remains after pruning by its lower bound we could have also use the upper bound or an average of both bounds since this is only an estimate then given these constant estimated costs we compute a minimum cost edge cover by reducing the edge cover problem to a bipartite weighted matching problem as suggested in &make_named_href node21 html combopt ps82 since the weighted matching problem can be solved using standard techniques we do not present the details in this paper noting only that given a bipartite graph with n nodes and e edges the weighted matching problem can be solved in time o ne for our application e is the number of edges that remain in the induced graph after pruning sudarshan s chawathe sat feb 22 12 28 02 pst 1997
