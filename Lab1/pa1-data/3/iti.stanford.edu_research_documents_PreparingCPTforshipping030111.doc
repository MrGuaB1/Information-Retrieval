isolation of human pbmc from whole blood stanford human immune monitoring center stanford ca 94305 phone 650 723 5050 preparing cpt tubes for shipping 1 principle cpt tubes are blood collection tubes that contain a gel plug upon centrifugation erythrocytes and granulocytes migrate through the gel plug leaving serum and pbmc above the plug in this state the cells are more robust to shipping and recovery and cryopreservation of pbmc can be done at a central site 2 materials and equipment 2.1 cpt tubes 8 ml with sodium heparin bd 362753 2.2 centrifuge with swing out rotor capable of 1500 1800 rcf 2.3 foam packing material 3 procedure 3.1 follow steps 1 4 in the bd procedure found at http www bd com vacutainer products molecular heparin procedure asp 3.2 after centrifugation wrap tubes with protective foam or pack in a foam box and ship via fedex priority delivery to the address in the header at the top of this page 4 notes 4.1 be sure to measure your centrifuge rotor radius to the base of the tube then perform the calculation on the website above to determine the proper speed to achieve 1500 1800 rcf 4.2 check cpt tube placement in your centrifuge carriers to be sure that the carriers can swing out without having the tube hit the rotor this can cause the tube to break 4.3 spin tubes as soon as possible and not more than 2 hours after blood collection 4.4 spin tubes for 15 20 minutes at room temperature 4.5 it is normal to see some red cells in or above the gel plug after centrifugation in some donors protocol preparing cpt for shipping march 1 2011 author holden maecker
