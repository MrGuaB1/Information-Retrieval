report number cs tr 89 1278 institution stanford university department of computer science title the complexity of circuit value and network stability author mayr ernst w author subramanian ashok date august 1989 abstract we develop a method for non trivially restricting fanout in a circuit we study the complexity of the circuit value problem and a new problem network stability when fanout is limited this leads to new classes of problems within p we conjecture that the new classes are different from p and incomparable to nc one of these classes cc contains several natural complete problems including circuit value for comparator circuits lex first maximal matching and problems related to stable marriage and stable roommates when fanout is appropriately limited we get positive results a parallel algorithm for circuit value that runs in time about the square root of the number of gates a linear time sequential algorithm for network stability and logspace reductions between circuit value and network stability ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 89 1278 cs tr 89 1278 pdf
