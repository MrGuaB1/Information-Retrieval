presentation charts presentation charts new ideas an object exchange model for representing information extracted from heterogeneous information sources the automated generation of translators that provide access to heterogeneous sources the automated generation of mediators that integrate information from several sources a toolkit for managing constraints across heterogeneous sources impact rapid translator generation will allow the immediate integration of new sources as they become available rapid mediator generation will make it possible to adapt to the changing requirements of information consumers effective constraint management will make the information that is available be correct or at least identified as inconsistent overall this technology will make it possible for decision makers to have access to the information they need when they need it schedule month 6 oem and its query language developed month 12 basic architecture and sample translators and mediators demonstrated month 18 architecture for translator generator and mediator generator specified month 24 preliminary prototype for translator generator and constraint management implemented and demonstrated month 30 preliminary prototype for mediator generator implemented and demonstrated month 36 demonstration of final prototypes and developed technologies stanford university an integrated information management system return to progress report outline
