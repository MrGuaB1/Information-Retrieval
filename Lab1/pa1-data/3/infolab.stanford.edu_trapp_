trapp project tradeoff in replication precision and performance stanford university database group about the trapp project the trapp team is investigating techniques for trading off precision for performance in replicated data environments there are fundamental limits on the performance of replicated data environments when exact consistency and exact pr ecision are necessary however performance gains can often be achieved if precision requirements can be relaxed in practice unbounded imprecision is often introduced in order to achieve better performance the goal of the trapp project is to investigat e techniques to permit controlled and explicit relaxation of data precision in exchange for improved performance our past work focused on an approximate data caching architecture that permits fine grained control of the precision performance tradeoff for numerical data in data caching environments we are currently working on applying these techniques and oth ers to more complex data such as web pages for a more detailed description of our work and a more complete discussion of our plans for future work please see our papers people chris olston jennifer widom brian babcock tomas feder yu shan fung keith ito jing jiang boon thau loo rajeev motwani liadan o callaghan rina panigrahy demos click here for a java demonstration of our best effort cache synchronization algorithm click here for a java demonstration of our adaptive precision setting algorithm our papers c olston j jiang and j widom adaptive filters for continuous queries over distributed data streams to appear sigmod 2003 b babcock and c olston distributed top k monitoring to appear sigmod 2003 c olston and j widom best effort cache synchronization with source cooperation acm sigmod 2002 international conference on management of data madison wisconsin june 2002 pp 73 84 c olston bt loo and j widom adaptive precision setting for cached approximate values acm sigmod 2001 international conference on management of data santa barbara california may 2001 pp 355 366 c olston and j widom offering a precision performance tradeoff for aggregation queries over replicated data twenty sixth international conference on very large data bases vldb 2 000 cairo egypt september 2000 pp 144 155 t feder r motwani l o callaghan c olston and r panigrahy computing shortest paths with uncertainty to appear twentieth international symposium on theoretical aspects of computer science stacs february 2003 t feder r motwani r panigrahy c olston and j widom computing the median with uncertainty 32nd acm symposium on theory of computing stoc 2000 portland oregon may 2000 also to appear in siam journal on computing other papers based on trapp s khanna and w tan on computing functions with uncertainty pods 2001 university of pennsylvania abstract ps gz pdf
