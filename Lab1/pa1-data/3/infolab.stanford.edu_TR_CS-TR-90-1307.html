report number cs tr 90 1307 institution stanford university department of computer science title real time logics complexity and expressiveness author alur rajeev author henzinger thomas a date march 1990 abstract the theory of the natural numbers with linear order and monadic predicates underlies propositional linear temporal logic to study temporal logics for real time systems we combine this classical theory of infinite state sequences with a theory of time via a monotonic function that maps every state to its time the resulting theory of timed state sequences is shown to be decidable albeit nonelementary and its expressive power is characterized by omega regular sets several more expressive variants are proved to be highly undecidable this framework allows us to classify a wide variety of real time logics according to their complexity and expressiveness in fact it follows that most formalisms proposed in the literature cannot be decided we are however able to identify two elementary real time temporal logics as expressively complete fragments of the theory of timed state sequences and give tableau based decision procedures consequently these two formalisms are well suited for the specification and verification of real time systems ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 90 1307 cs tr 90 1307 pdf
