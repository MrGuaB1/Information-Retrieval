wittgenstein versus godel on the foundations of logic page 1 seminar friday april 23 2010 this talk in four parts explains how some of the writings of ludwig wittgenstein can be interpreted as precursors of important developments in the foundations of mathematical logic for information systems applications these wittgenstein writings stand in almost exact opposition to the views of kurt godel first part the current state of foundations of mathematical logic for information systems applications is overviewed with regard to issues of expressiblity incompleteness and inconsistency tolerance second part the above developments have precursors in the following writings of wittgenstein  there can t in any fundamental sense be such a thing as meta mathematics thus it isn t enough to say that p is provable what we must say is provable according to a particular system  true in russell's system means as we have said proved in russell's system and false in russell's system means that the opposite has been proved in russell's system  have said with pride in a mathematical discovery eg inconsistency of russell's system because incompleteness is self proved look this is how we produce a contradiction  indeed even at this stage i predict a time when there will be mathematical investigations of calculi containing contradictions and people will actually be proud of having emancipated themselves from consistency third part the se views are contrasted with the almost opposite ones of godel the situation between godel and wittgenstein can be summarized as follows fourth part how do the above provide framework and guidance for the further development of logic for information systems applications further reading common sense for concurrency and inconsistency tolerance using direct logi c arxiv 0812.4852 carl hewitt is emeritus in the electrical engineering and computer science department at the massachusetts institute of technology mit he obtained his phd in mathematics at mit in 1971 under the supervision of seymour papert adviser marvin minsky and mike paterson he is known for his work on the design of planner a pioneering programming language based on plans invoked by assertions and goals comparative schematology knowledge representation concurrency theory and concurrent programming the scientific community metaphor with bill kornfeld automatic storage reclamation garbage collection with henry lieberman orgs organizations of restricted generality participatory semantics with carl manning organizational commitment strongly paraconsistent logic privacy friendly client cloud computing participatory behavioral model checking and semantic integration wittgenstein versus godel on the foundations of logic carl hewitt http carlhewitt info godel 1 mathematics is based on objective truth 2 roundtripping proves incompleteness but hopefully not inconsistency 3 theories should be proved consistent wittgenstein 1 mathematics is based on communities of practice 2 self proof of incompleteness leads to inconsistency 3 theories should use inconsistency tolerant reasoning
