gps a large scale graph processing system gps a large scale graph processing system overview we are building a distributed system for large scale graph computations with the same high level goals as the hadoop system or map reduce framework transparent scalability transparent fault tolerance and a simple programming interface there have been two main approaches for building such a system in the past hadoop based systems distributed message passing systems in many graph algorithms eg computing pagerank or finding connected components the computation proceeds iteratively until a convergence criterion is met hadoop based systems extend hadoop to support iterations of map reduce phases in message passing systems the vertices of the graph are distributed across machines which send each other messages in iterations to perform the computation pregel a proprietary system at google introduced the latter approach gps is a message passing system that we intend to make open source when it's ready similar to pregel the user defines a function that is applied to each vertex in parallel during each iteration of the computation gps operates in a master slave model in addition to fully vertex centric computations it also supports global state the user can optionally implement a pair of functions that enable computing global properties of the graph broadcast to each worker in each iteration gps takes as input a graph that is partitioned into as many files as there are workers it optionally repartitions the graph at the end of each iteration sending some vertices across workers to reduce overall traffic our current research focus is understanding the effects of different static and dynamic graph partitioning schemes on system performance we are specifically studying network and wall clock performance of the system under the following partitioning schemes and algorithms across graphs of various sizes partitioning schemes random static partitioning spectral clustering static partitioning domain based static partitioning for web graphs greedy dynamic partitioning algorithms pagerank spectral clustering diameter estimation minimum spanning tree the gps project is supported by the national science foundation grant iis 0904497 kaust and an amazon web services research grant people faculty jennifer widom students semih salihoglu last edited by semih salihoglu august 2011
