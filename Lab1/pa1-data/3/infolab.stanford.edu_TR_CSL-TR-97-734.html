report number csl tr 97 734 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title packet switching photonic network switch design and routing algorithm author lee hyuk jun author morf martin author flynn michael date december 1997 abstract maturity of photonic technology makes it possible to construct all optical network switch to avoid optical to electrical signal conversion for routing to realize all optical packet switching our current network topology and routing algorithms have to be reexamined and modified to satisfy the necessities of all optical network switching such as a fast routing decision consideration of hardware implementation buffering etc in this paper first we will review various switching architectures including crossbar benes and batcher banyan secondly optical implementation of a multiple output port network switch will be presented in many levels of networking from multiprocessor interconnection to wide area networking multiple latencies resulting from this scheme could improve the overall performance when combined with smart routing schemes finally we present a interpretation of multistage network using a symmetric group a cayley graph for a symmetric group and its coset graphs suggest an interesting alternative way to construct a new multistage interconnection network ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 97 734 csl tr 97 734 pdf
