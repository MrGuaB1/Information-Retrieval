report number csl tr 93 570 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title frequency domain volume rendering author totsuka takashi author levoy marc date april 1993 abstract the fourier projection slice theorem allos projections of volume data to be generated in o nsquare log n time for a volumbe of size ncube the method operates by extracting and inverse fourier transforming 2d slices from a 3d frequency domain representation of the volume unfortunately these projections do not exhibit the occlusion that is characteristic of conventional volume renderings we present a new frequency domain volume rendering algorithm that replaces much of the missing depth and shape cues by performing shading calculations in the frequency domain during slice extraction in particular we demonstrate frequency domain methods for computing linear or nonlinear depth cueing and directional diffuse reflection the resulting images can be generated an order of magnitude faster than volume renderings and may be more useful for many applications ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 93 570 csl tr 93 570 pdf
