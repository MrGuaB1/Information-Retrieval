report number cs tn 98 86 institution stanford university department of computer science title the earth mover's distance as a metric for image retrieval author rubner yossi author tomasi carlo author guibas leonidas j date september 1998 abstract we introduce a metric between two distributions that we call the earth mover's distance emd the emd is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other in a precise sense we show that the emd has attractive properties for content based image retrieval the most important one as we show is that it matches perceptual similarity better than other distances used for image retrieval the emd is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization for which efficient algorithms are available and also allows naturally for partial matching it is more robust than histogram matching techniques in that it can operate on variable length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms when used to compare distributions with the same overall mass the emd is a true metric in this paper we focus on applications to color and texture and we compare the retrieval performance of the emd with that of other distances ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tn 98 86 cs tn 98 86 pdf
