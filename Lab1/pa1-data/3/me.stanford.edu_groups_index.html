groups stanford engineering intranet in order to realize the academic and research goals of the mechnical engineering department and give tangible expression to our academic themes we have organized ourselves into five distinct academic groups & programs which are described briefly below biomechanical engineering bme program view the biomechanical engineering bme program has teaching and research activities which focus primarily on musculoskeletal biomechanics neuromuscular biomechanics cardiovascular biomechanics and rehabilitation engineering research in other areas including hearing ocean plant and vision biomechanics exist in collaboration with associated faculty in biology engineering and medicine the biomechanical engineering program has particularly strong research interactions with the mechanics and computation and the design groups and the departments of functional restoration neurology radiology and surgery in the school of medicine design group view the design group emphasizes cognitive skill development for creative design it is concerned with automatic control computer aided design creativity design aesthetics design for manufacturability design research experimental stress analysis fatigue and fracture mechanics finite element analysis human factors kinematics manufacturing systems microcomputers in design micro electromechanics systems mems robotics and vehicle dynamics the design group offers undergraduate and graduate programs in product design jointly with the department of art and art history and is centrally involved in the founding of stanford's new hasso plattner institute of design flow physics and computational engineering fpce group view the flow physics and computational engineering group fpce is developing new theories models and computational tools for accurate engineering design analysis and control of complex flows including acoustics chemical reactions interactions with electromagnetic waves plasmas and other phenomena of interest in aerodynamics electronics cooling environment engineering materials processing planetary entry propulsion and power systems and other areas a significant emphasis of fpce research is on modeling and analysis of physical phenomena in engineering systems fpce students and research staff are developing new methods and tools for generation access display interpretation and post processing of large databases resulting from numerical simulations of physical systems research in fpce ranges from advanced simulation of complex turbulent flows to active flow control the fpce faculty teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in acoustics aerodynamics computational fluid mechanics computational mathematics fluid mechanics combustion and thermodynamics and propulsion mechanics and computation group view the mechanics and computational group covers biomechanics continuum mechanics dynamics experimental and computational mechanics finite element analysis fluid dynamics fracture mechanics micromechanics nanotechnology and simulation based design qualified students can work as research project assistants engaging in thesis research in working association with the faculty director and fellow students projects include analysis synthesis and control of systems biomechanics flow dynamics of liquids and gases fracture and micro mechanics vibrations and nonlinear dynamics and original theoretical computational and experimental investigations in the strength and deformability of elastic and inelastic elements of machines and structures thermosciences group view the thermosciences group conducts experimental and analytical research on both fundamental and applied topics in the general area of thermal and fluid systems research strengths include high reynolds number flows microfluidics combustion and reacting flows multiphase flow and combustion plasma sciences gas physics and chemistry laser diagnostics microscale heat transfer convective heat transfer and energy systems research motivation comes from applications including air breathing and space propulsion bioanalytical systems pollution control electronics fabrication and cooling stationary and mobile energy systems biomedical systems and materials processing there is a strong emphasis on fundamental experiments leading towards advances in modeling optimization and control of complex systems stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni themes that define us groups & programs biomechanical engineering design flow physics & computation mechanics & computation thermosciences faculty & research admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
