in the first batch of exercises g operatorname su 3 and as usual varpi_1 and varpi_2 are the fundamental dominant weights exercise 25.1 by proposition 25.4 all the weights in chi_ lambda lie in the set s lambda mu in lambda hspace 0.25 em hspace 0.25 em text lambda succcurlyeq w mu for all w in w hspace 0.75 em lambda mu in lambda_ operatorname root confirm by examining the weights that this is true for all the examples in chapter 24 in fact for all these examples s mu is exactly the set of weights exercise 25.2 use the weyl dimension formula to compute the dimension of chi_ 2 varpi_1 deduce from this that the symmetric square of the standard representation is irreducible exercise 25.3 use the weyl dimension formula to compute the dimension of chi_ varpi_1 2 varpi_2 deduce from this that the symmetric square of the standard representation is irreducible exercise 25.4 use brauer's method proposition 25.8 to compute the tensor product of the contragredient of the standard representation with character chi_ varpi_2 and the adjoint representation with character chi_ varpi_1 varpi_2 exercise 25.5 prove the following extension of proposition 25.8 suppose that lambda is dominant and that nu is any weight by proposition 21.1 there exists a weyl group element such that w nu lambda rho in mathcal c _ the point w nu lambda rho is uniquely determined even though w may not be if w nu lambda rho is on the boundary of mathcal c _ define xi nu lambda 0 if w nu lambda rho is not on the boundary of mathcal c _ explain why w nu lambda rho rho in mathcal c _ and w is uniquely determined in this case define xi nu lambda 1 l w chi_ w nu lambda rho rho prove that if mu is a dominant weight and chi_ mu sum m nu e nu then chi_ mu chi_ lambda sum_ nu m nu xi nu lambda exercise 25.6 use the last exercise to compute the decomposition of chi_ varpi_1 2 into irreducibles and obtain another proof that the symmetric square of the standard representation is irreducible
