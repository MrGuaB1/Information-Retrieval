mechanics and computation analysis of crack propagation by the principle of local symmetry stanford mechanics and computation home people research teaching seminar schedule faq matteo negri ph d november 11 2010 analysis of crack propagation by the principle of local symmetry for planar mixed mode crack propagation in brittle materials many similar criteria have been proposed in the classical literature on fracture mechanics mathematical techniques based on perturbation analysis and analytic functions have been usually employed to predict the crack path at least for small increments an alternative mathematical approach more based on functional analysis is being developed in the last years its application to mixed mode planar crack propagation will be presented in the seminar the principle of local symmetry together with griffith's criterion will be the governing equations for the evolution stress intensity factors a crucial ingredient in theory and practice will be employed in a non local fashion retrieved from http mc stanford edu cgi bin index php title 3155 member login log in page discussion view source history what links here related changes upload file special pages editing instructions
