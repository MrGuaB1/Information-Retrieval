report number csl tr 71 24 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title an improved reliability model for nmr author siewiorek daniel p date december 1971 abstract the classical reliability model for n modular redundancy nmr assumes the network to be failed when a majority of modules which drive the same voter fail it has long been known that this model is pessimistic since there are instances termed compensating module failures where a majority of the modules fail but the network is nonfailed a different module reliability model based on lead reliability is proposed which has the classical nmr reliability model as a special case it is shown that the standard procedure for altering the classical model to take compensating module failures into account may predict a network reliability which is too low in some cases and too high in others it is also demonstrated that the improved model can increase the predicted mission time the time the system is to operate at or above a given reliability by 50 over the classical model prediction for a simple network ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 71 24 csl tr 71 24 pdf
