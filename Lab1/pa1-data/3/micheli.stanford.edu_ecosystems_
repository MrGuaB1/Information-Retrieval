the project the ecology of coral reef ecosystems coral reefs are highly diverse and valuable marine ecosystems that are under threat worldwide from myriad stressors they provide the literal foundation for atoll ecosystems and atoll societies providing for the future health of coral reefs and the people that depend on these reefs in a changing world requires accurately addressing the threats to coral reefs and developing solutions that mitigate these threats in this project we have assembled a uniquely diverse collaboration of scientists to study interactions between humans and coral reefs in the central pacific in this work we aim to generate information that will improve the way we think about the ecology of coral reefs and will increase what we know about the role that humans play in these ecosystems we hope that some of the products we produce will aid local and global managers to develop new tools and strategies to safeguard the long term health of coral reefs and reef dependent communities an interdisciplinary approach to coral reef health addressing the factors that threaten the health of coral reefs is a complex problem to effectively address this problem we have assembled a group of stanford researchers with expertise that crosses traditional research boundaries this novel research partnership includes anthropologists biogeochemists and ecologists by combining the strengths of these different disciplines in a focused research effort we can hope to make a real contribution to improving the ways we understand and manage coral reefs coral reef ecosystem research
