sullivan's abstract mediators easing the design and evolution of integrated systems kevin j sullivan computer science department university of virginia sullivan cs virginia edu abstract a pervasive problem in software architecture is to design systems in which multiple representations of related data are tightly integrated the problem is that integration inhibits the decomposition of systems into cohesive and independent modules we present a general solution that is applicable in many domains we cast data representations as independent modules and the behavioral relationships that integrate them as separate cohesive mediator modules we show that abstract data type based modules do not support such decompositions and that implicit invocation by itself does not provide much additional help we then introduce abstract behavioral types abts as a basis for modules and show that abts are suited to representing both the data to be integrated and the relationships needed to integrate them to guide software architects in using behavioral abstractions we present behavioral entity relationship modeling as a new architectural style we discuss applications to a variety of environments and tools
