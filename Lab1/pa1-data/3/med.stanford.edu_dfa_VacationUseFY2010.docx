january 20 2010 to school of medicine faculty and staff from marcia cohen senior associate dean for finance and administration subject vacation use 2010 dear colleagues as you know we implemented several cost cutting measures during fy09 and fy10 including required use of vacation in fy09 your cooperation in taking vacation time saved the school of medicine overall $3 million these savings were returned to whatever source of funding supports your position including grants and gifts operating budget etc vacation use during fy10 we are continuing to require part time and full time staff employees including bargaining unit workers who have at least 80 hours accrued vacation to use all vacation days accrued during this fiscal year we notified staff in november 2008 that this requirement would continue through fy10 i am attaching a summary of the requirements for vacation use for fy10 and a reminder of the requirements for reducing vacation to new maximum accruals put in place by the university if balances at the end of calendar year 2009 were not at or below the maximum allowable hours then vacation ceases to accrue until the balances drops below the maximum please see administrative guide memo 22.5 http adminguide stanford edu 22_5 pdf also please refer to paragraphs 198 199 of the collective bargaining agreement that states vacation time earned should be taken each year if possible we encourage all employees to take vacation annually when vacation days are taken the funds covering these days are charged to previously banked funds in a central pool and result in savings to school funds and as you can see from the savings mentioned above this has a significant impact on reducing our budgets for employees accruing vacation at 17 days year if your balance is not at 320 by year end december 31 2010 your vacation will cease to accrue until the balances drop below the maximum therefore we encourage you to reduce your vacation balances even before calendar year end if you set a goal to reach this maximum allowable balance on or before the end of the fiscal year august 31 2010 rather than waiting until the end of the calendar year you will avoid any loss of accruals beginning in january 2011 please discuss your vacation plans with your supervisor well in advance and plan accordingly to meet these goals mandatory closures as you also know the school of medicine closed the weekday prior to three designated university holidays this year memorial day july 4th and labor day we have made the decision not to designate these closures during 2010 we are mindful that there may be special circumstances requiring an exception to the requirement to use accrued vacation during the same fiscal year in which it is accrued again for this fiscal year we would expect those situations to be rare any exceptions must be approved in advance by a supervisor your departmental dfa and by the human resource group employee relations i would like to again thank all of you who met the requirements during fy09 and encourage everyone to plan accordingly to meet the requirements for fy10 if you have any questions please call an employee relations specialist or call 5 8615 and you will be connected with an employee relations specialist to assist you administrative guide memo 22.4 vacation section 1 e 1 maximum vacation accumulation accrual rate days year 2009 maximum accrual days hours eff 1 1 2010 maximum accrual days hours eff 1 1 2011 maximum accrual days hours eff 1 1 2012 maximum accrual days hours 15 37.5 300 37.5 300 37.5 300 30 240 17 42.5 340 42.5 340 40 320 30 240 20 50 400 50 400 40 320 30 240 22 55 440 50 400 40 320 30 240 24 60 480 50 400 40 320 30 240
