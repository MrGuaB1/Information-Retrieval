report number csl tr 91 468 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title efficient moment based timing analysis for variable accuracy switch level simulation author kao russell author horowitz mark date april 1991 abstract we describe a timing analysis algorithm which can achieve the efficiency of rc tree analysis while retaining much of the generality of asymptotic waveform estimation rc tree analysis from switch level simulation is generalized to handle piecewise linear transistor models non tree topologies floating capacitors and feedback for simple switch level models the complexity is o n the algorithm allows the user to trade off efficiency vs accuracy through the selection of transistor models of varying complexity ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 91 468 csl tr 91 468 pdf
