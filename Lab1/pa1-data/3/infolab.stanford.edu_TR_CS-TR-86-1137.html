report number cs tr 86 1137 institution stanford university department of computer science title the leaf file access protocol author mogul jeffrey date december 1986 abstract personal computers are superior to timesharing systems in many ways but they are inferior in this respect they make it harder for users to share files a local area network provides a substrate upon which file sharing can be built one must also have a protocol for sharing files this report describes leaf one of the first protocols to allow remote access to files leaf is a remote file access protocol rather than a file transfer protocol unlike a file transfer protocol which must create a complete copy of a file a file access protocol provides random access directly to the file itself this promotes sharing because it allows simultaneous access to a file by several remote users and because it avoids the creation of new copies and the associated consistency maintenance problem the protocol described in this report is nearly obsolete it is interesting for historical reasons primarily because it was perhaps the first non proprietary remote file access protocol actually implemented and also because it serves as a case study in practical protocol design the specification of leaf is included as an appendix it has not been widely available outside of stanford ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 86 1137 cs tr 86 1137 pdf
