report number csl tr 93 593 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title the performance advantages of integrating message passing in cache coherent multiprocessors author woo steven cameron author singh jaswinder pal author hennessy john l date november 1993 abstract we examine the performance benefits of integrating a mechanism for block data transfer message passing in a cache coherent shared address space multiprocessor we do this through a detailed study of five important computations that appear to be likely candidates for block transfer we find that while the benefits on a realistic architecture are significant in some cases they are not as substantial as one might initially expect the main reasons for this are i the relatively modest fraction of time that applications spend in communication that is amenable to block transfer ii the difficulty of finding enough independent computation to overlap with the communication latency that remains even after block transfer and iii the fact that long cache lines often capture many of the benefits of block transfer of the three primary advantages of block transfer fast pipelined data transfer appears to be the most successful followed by the ability to overlap computation and communication at a coarse granularity and finally the benefits of replicating communicated data in main memory we also examine the impact of varying important network parameters and processor speed on the relative effectiveness of block transfer and comment on useful features that a block transfer engine should support for real applications ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 93 593 csl tr 93 593 pdf
