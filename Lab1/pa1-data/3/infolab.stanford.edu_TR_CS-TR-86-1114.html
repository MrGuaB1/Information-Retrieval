report number cs tr 86 1114 institution stanford university department of computer science title optimizing function free recursive inference rules author naughton jeffrey f date may 1986 abstract recursive inference rules arise in recursive definitions in logic programming systems and in database systems with recursive query languages let d be a recursive definition of a relation t we say that d is minimal if for any predicate p in a recursive rule in d p must appear in a recursive rule in any definition of t we show that testing for minimality is in general undecidable however we do present an efficient algorithm for a useful class of recursive rules and show how to use it to transform a recursive definition to a minimal recursive definition evaluating the optimized definition will avoid redundant computation without the overhead of caching intermediate results and run time checking for duplicate goals ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 86 1114 cs tr 86 1114 pdf
