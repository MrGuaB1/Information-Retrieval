report number cs tr 71 191 institution stanford university department of computer science title an introduction to the direct emulation of control structures by a parallel micro computer author lesser victor r date january 1971 abstract this paper is an investigation of the organization of a parallel micro computer designed to emulate a wide variety of sequential and parallel computers this micro computer allows tailoring of its control structure so that it is appropriate for the particular computer to be emulated the control structure of this micro computer is dynamically modified by changing the organization of its data structure for control the micro computer contains six primitive operators which dynamically manipulate and generate a tree type data structure for control this data structure for control is used as a syntactic framework within which particular implementations of control concepts such as iteration recursion co routines parallelism interrupts etc can be easily expressed the major features of the control data structure and the primitive operators are 1 once the fixed control and data linkages among processes have been defined they need not be rebuilt on subsequent executions of the control structure 2 micro programs may be written so that they execute independently of the number of physical processors present and still take advantage of available processors 3 control structures for i o processes data accessing processes and computational processes are expressed in a single uniform framework an emulator programmed on this micro computer works as an iterative two step process similar to the process of dynamic compilation or run time macro expansion this dynamic compilation approach to emulation differs considerably from the conventional approach to emulation and provides a unifying approach to the emulation of a wide variety of sequential and parallel computers ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 71 191 cs tr 71 191 pdf
