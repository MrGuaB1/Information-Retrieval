kuo lab website angiogenesis we are interested in determining functions of novel molecules regulating angiogenesis including receptors micrornas and secreted molecules typically we use loss of function approaches through knockout and conditional knockout mice we also have extensive experience using adenoviral expression of soluble receptor ectodomains to inhibit angiogenic pathways including vegf and pdgfrb loss of function phenotypes would simulate the effects of pharmacologic inhibition of novel targets for anti angiogenic therapy of cancer and ocular disorders endothelial cell regulation of physiology how do endothelial cells regulate physiology of their host organs the liver hepatocyte appears particularly responsive to its host endothelial cells we are investigating effects of vegf inhibition on hepatocyte functions in terms of epo synthesis erythropoiesis and metabolic pathways we are also correlating these changes with anti tumor response and survival in cancer patients receiving vegf inhibitors as potential surrogate biomarkers of efficacy intestinal stem progenitor biology the complete regeneration of the epithelial lining of the intestine every 5 7 days renders the intestine a model system for studying stem cell behaviors we are investigating the regulation of the intestinal stem cell isc compartment by extracellular signals such as wnts using adenoviral and conditional knockout approaches further we have derived robust methods for prolonged culture of and ex vivo expansion of primary intestinal tissue with preservation of iscs additional methods are under development for purification and analysis of mouse and human iscs nanoparticle mediated systemic sirna delivery the potential of sirna to silence currently undruggable targets such as intracellular transcription factors is tempered by substantial obstacles to systemic sirna delivery we are working collaboratively to use nanoparticle based methods to target sirna to cancer cells towards the development of novel cancer therapeutics
