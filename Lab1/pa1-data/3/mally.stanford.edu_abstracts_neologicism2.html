neo logicism an ontological reduction of mathematics to metaphysics what is neo logicism authors bernard linsky and edward n zalta reference the bulletin of symbolic logic 12 1 2006 60 99 abstract abstract in this paper we investigate 1 what can be salvaged from the original project of logicism and 2 what is the best that can be done if we lower our sights a bit logicism is the view that mathematics is reducible to logic alone and there are a variety of reasons why it was a non starter we consider the various ways of weakening this claim so as to produce a neologicism three ways are discussed 1 expand the conception of logic used in the reduction 2 allow the addition of analytic sounding principles to logic so that the reduction is not to logic alone but to logic and truths knowable a priori and 3 revise the conception of reducible we show how the current versions of neologicism fit into this classification scheme and then focus on a kind of neologicism which we take to have the most potential for achieving the epistemological goals of the original logicist project we argue that that the weaker the form of neologicism the more likely it is to be a new form of logicism and show how our preferred system though mathematically weak is metaphysically and epistemogically strong and can reduce arbitrary mathematical theories to logic and analytic truths if given a legitimate new sense of reduction preprint available online in pdf
