jks folks the salisbury group web page home welcome to the salisbury research group home page most of our group's work focuses on the physical interaction between human beings and computer driven actuators this includes both haptics and human friendly robotics haptics is roughly defined as using force feedback to simulate interaction with virtual objects haptics research in the salisbury group is geared toward simulating complex manual tasks for surgical simulation and collaborative networked environments we experiment with several commercially available haptic interfaces primarily the phantom haptic device from sensable technologies inc and the delta haptic device from force dimension inc in addition to developing our own haptic interface hardware the human friendly robot project aims to design safe efficient mechanisms that will allow robots to be placed in direct contact with human beings projects are underway that explore all levels of human friendly robotics from mechanism design to control to high level interactions the group is directed by professor kenneth salisbury a faculty member in the robotics lab at stanford
