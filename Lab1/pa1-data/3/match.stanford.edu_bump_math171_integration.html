integration integration pdf version of this document for printing our textbook develops the theory of integration in greater generality than we have time for in these notes i will give a shorter route to the fundamental theorem of calculus the intention is to bypass most of sections 52 55 theorem 1 let f be a continuous function on a b define f x int_a xf t d t 1 then f is differentiable on a b and f f proof click to expand collapse we will first show that if x in a b then f _r x f x similarly one may show that if x in a b then f _l x f x but we leave this to the reader let x in a b and let varepsilon 0 be given we will show there exists a delta 0 such x delta le b and such that if y in x x delta then left frac f y f x y x f x right varepsilon 2 this will prove that f _r x lim_ y rightarrow x frac f y f x y x f x because f is continuous we may choose delta such that x y delta implies that f x f y varepsilon let y in x x delta by the mean value theorem for integrals theorem 51.14 of the text there exists c in x x delta such that f y f x int_x yf t dt y x f c therefore left frac f y f x y x f x right f c f x varepsilon as required this proves 2 and therefore that f _r x f x we leave the left hand derivative to the reader proposition 1 suppose that f is differentiable on a b and that f x 0 for all x in a b then f is a constant function that is f x f a for all x in a b proof click to expand collapse let x in a b by the mean value theorem theorem 49.6 there exists c in a x such that f x f a x a f c since f c 0 we see that f x f a as required if f is a continuous function on a b by an antiderivative of f we mean a function f that is differentiable on a b such that f f theorem 1 shows that f has antiderivatives for example 1 theorem 2 let f be a continuous function on a b and let f be an antiderivative of f then int_a bf t dt f b f a 3 proof click to expand collapse define phi x int_a xf t d t then phi is also an antiderivative of f by theorem 1 so f phi 0 and therefore f phi is constant by proposition 1 we thus have f b phi b f a phi a f a since phi a 0 therefore phi b f b f a which is 3 theorems 1 and 2 together form the fundamental theorem of calculus in sufficient generality for our purposes in the book this is theorem 56.1 there is one important result in the sections that we will be skipping namely the integration by parts formula a version of this is in the book as theorem 53.3 proposition 2 integration by parts suppose that f and g are differentiable on a b then int_a bf x g x dx int_a bg x f x dx f b g b f a g a 4 proof click to expand collapse we note that by the leibnitz rule theorem 48.5 b we have fg f g fg so by the fundamental theorem of calculus f b g b f a g a int_a b f x g x f x g x d x rearranging gives 4
