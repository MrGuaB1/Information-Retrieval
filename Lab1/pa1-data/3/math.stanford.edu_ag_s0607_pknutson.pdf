stanford algebraic geometry seminar page 1 stanford algebraic geometry seminar limits of varieties subschemes vs branchvarieties allen knutson san diego abstract let f be a family of algebraic varieties in projective space depending on a nonzero parameter t one can define the t 0 limiting subvariety but this behaves badly eg two points colliding to become one the usual workaround is to introduce subschemes of projective space whose coordinate rings may contain nilpotents then a nice limit exists uniquely and there is a complete moduli space of subschemes the hilbert scheme in this talk i ll give an alternate approach where one keeps variety and gives up sub define a branchvariety of projective space as a reduced scheme with a finite map to projective space ie proper with finite fibers then after introducing a high enoughth root of t the limit branchvariety exists uniquely and there is a complete moduli stack of branchvarieties hartshorne's thesis is that the only locally constant invariant of families of subschemes is the hilbert polynomial in some sense this is a negative result to study families of subvarieties one must buy a huge package deal of subschemes there turn out to be many more locally constant invariants of branchvarieties this work is joint with valery alexeev of the university of georgia friday january 26 3 15 pm room 383 n http math stanford edu ag s0607
