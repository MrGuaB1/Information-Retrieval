differential example for example consider two containers q 1 and q 2 the transfer rates out of q 1 are 2 units time going into q 2 and zero leaking into the environment while the transfer rates out of q 2 are 1 2 unit time into q 1 and 3 2 units time into the environment can we determine the change in contents of q 1 and q 2 solution a 9 c 1
