enabling declarative graph analytics over large noisy information networks amol deshpande university of maryland over the last decade information networks have become ubiquitous and widespread these include social networks communication networks financial transaction networks citation networks disease transmission networks and many more social contact graphs are expected to be available for analysis in near future and can potentially be used to gain insights into various social phenomena as well as in disease outbreak and prevention there is thus a growing need for data management systems that can support both real time ingest storage and querying over information networks and complex analysis over them however there is a lack of established data management systems and tools that can manage such graph structured data in this talk i will discuss some of our early work on building a graph database system to support declarative analytics and i will specifically focus on our work addressing two challenges first the raw observational data describing information networks is typically noisy and incomplete and often at the wrong level of fidelity and abstraction for meaningful data analysis this has resulted in a growing body of somewhat ad hoc and domain specific work on extracting cleaning and annotating network data i will present the architecture of a data management system that we are building that supports a declarative datalog based language for specifying analysis tasks over network data second the increasing availability of the digital trace of information networks over time has opened up opportunities both in temporal evolutionary analysis as well as in data mining and comparative analytics over historical information i will discuss our ongoing work on managing such historical network data and on supporting efficient retrieval of multiple graphs from arbitrary time points in the past
