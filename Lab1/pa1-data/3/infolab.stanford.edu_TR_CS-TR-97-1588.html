report number cs tr 97 1588 institution stanford university department of computer science title systems of bilinear equations author cohen scott author tomasi carlo date april 1997 abstract how hard is it to solve a system of bilinear equations no solutions are presented in this report but the problem is posed and some preliminary remarks are made in particular solving a system of bilinear equations is reduced by a suitable transformation of its columns to solving a homogeneous system of bilinear equations in turn the latter has a nontrivial solution if and only if there exist two invertible matrices that when applied to the tensor of the coefficients of the system zero its first column matlab code is given to manipulate three dimensional tensors including a procedure that finds one solution to a bilinear system often but not always ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 97 1588 cs tr 97 1588 pdf
