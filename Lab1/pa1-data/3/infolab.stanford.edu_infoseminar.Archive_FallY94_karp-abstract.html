karp abstract a storage system for scalable knowledge representation dr peter d karp ai center sri international frame knowledge representation systems frss can be viewed as a distant cousin of object oriented databases the semantic model presented by frss presents many interesting contrasts to typical c++ based object oriented databases oodbs the object system is separate from the programming language it permits run time schema alteration it computes subsumption relationships among class definitions and it supports rule based inference the oodb community could learn much by studying this large family of systems over 50 members our group at sri is addressing several limitations of frss by building on existing database systems frss cannot support high speed access to large knowledge bases nor do they have multi user access capabilities we have designed a storage subsystem for frss by submerging an existing dbms within an frs we report on empirical evaluations of several variants of this architecture we compared the performance of different dbmss relational and object oriented we also developed and evaluated several optimizations including transferring data at different granularities and the use of prefetching the resulting system is in use in our group to manage information for the human genome project
