report number csl tr 94 625 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title an experimental chip to evaluate test techniques part 1 description of experiment author franco piero author stokes robert l author farwell william d author mccluskey edward j date june 1994 abstract a test chip has been designed and manufactured to evaluate different testing techniques for combinational or full scan circuits the test chip is a 25k gate cmos gate array using lsi logic's lft150k technology and includes support design for testability circuitry and five types of circuits under test cut over 5000 die have been manufactured the five circuits under test include both datapath and synthesized control logic the tests include design verification simulation exhaustive pseudo random and deterministic vectors for various fault models stuck at transition delay faults and iddq testing the chip will also be testing using the crosscheck methodology as well as other new technques including stability checking and very low voltage testing the experiment includes an investigation of both serial and parallel signature analysis this report describes the test evaluation chip experiment including the design of the test chip and the tests applied a future report will cover the experimental results and data analysis ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 94 625 csl tr 94 625 pdf
