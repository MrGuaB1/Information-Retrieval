the big picture the goal of onto agents is to establish an agent infrastructure on the www or www like networks such an agent infrastructure requires an information food chain every part of the food chain provides information which enables the existence of the next part the food chain starts with the construction of an ontology preferably with the onto agents ontology construction tool an ontology is the explicit specification of a conceptualization which provides all the required terminology and a basis for a community of interest for information exchange the ontology defines the terms that are possible to use for annotation information in webpages using the daml language the proposed onto agents webpage annotation tool has means to browse the ontology and to select appropriate terms of the ontology map to mark up sections of a webpage the webpage annotation process creates a set of annotated webpages which are available to an onto agent to achieve its tasks the onto agent itself needs several sub components specifically the onto agents inference system for the evaluation of rules and queries and general inferences the onto agents ontology articulation toolkit for mediation among information obtained from different ontologies the data in from the annotations can be used to construct additional websites a community web portal that presents a community of interest to the outside word in a concise manner and finally information seeking users can give specific retrieval tasks to an onto agent or they can query a community web portal for immediate access to the information home
