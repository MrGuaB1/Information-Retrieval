topology of surfaces page 1 stanford math circle topology of surfaces lenny ng october 30 2005 1 can you solve the houses utilities problem when everything is on the surface of a torus what about a klein bottle 2 a given four points in the plane connect them so that each point is connected to every other point and none of the connections cross now adapt the proof from the houses utilities problem using euler's formula to show that you can t do the same thing with five points in the plane or on the surface of a sphere if you could then you d have disproven the four color theorem b use euler's formula to prove that you can t join eight points pairwise on a torus c connect five points pairwise on a torus then six then seven hard if you get stuck look at http lat inf tu dresden de harris papers graphs7 this construction is famous in topology as the minimal triangulation of the torus d what about the klein bottle 3 can you comb a hairy torus a hairy klein bottle dividing a klein bottle into two mobius strips images from http www mathemagic org mobm moebiusmolecules html and http www fortunecity com emachines e11 86 klein1 html classification of closed surfaces orientable left and unorientable right the top right diagram is a klein bottle images from http www math ohio state edu fiedorow math655 classification html
