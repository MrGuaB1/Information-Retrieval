report number cs tr 90 1312 institution stanford university department of computer science title a validation structure based theory of plan modification and reuse author kambhampati subbarao author hendler james a date june 1990 abstract a framework for the flexible and conservative modification of plans enables a planner to modify its plans in response to incremental changes in their specifications to reuse its existing plans in new problem situations and to efficiently replan in response to execution time failures we present a theory of plan modification applicable to hierarchical nonlinear planning our theory utilizes the validation structure of stored plans to yield a flexible and conservative plan modification framework the validation structure which constitutes a hierarchical explanation of correctness of the plan with respect to the planner's own knowledge of the domain is annotated on the plan as a by product of initial planning plan modification is formalized as a process of removing inconsistencies in the validation structure of a plan when it is being reused in a new changed planning situation the repair of these inconsistencies involves removing unnecessary parts of the plan and adding new non primitive tasks to the plan to establish missing or failing validations the resultant partially reduced plan with a consistent validation structure is sent to the planner for complete reduction we discuss the development of this theory in the priar system present an empirical evaluation of this theory and characterize its completeness coverage efficiency and limitations ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 90 1312 cs tr 90 1312 pdf
