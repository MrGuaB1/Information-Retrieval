please title this page 234_7_d html in pharm 234 the paired t test involving two related means if the variables are paired then we are interested in the change between the first set of data and the second let one set of variables equal x and the other equal y the difference of a set n d n would equal x n minus y n d xy to conduct a paired t test of the mean we need two values first the mean of the differences of all of the pairs which is easily computed with the equation keep in mind that n equals the number of pairs second we require the standard deviation of the difference we now have the raw data needed to conduct a paired t test of means 5 13
