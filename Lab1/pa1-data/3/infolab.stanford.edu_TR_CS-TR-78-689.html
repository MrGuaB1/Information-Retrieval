report number cs tr 78 689 institution stanford university department of computer science title an n log n algorithm for the two variable per constraint linear programming satisfiability problem author nelson charles gregory date november 1978 abstract a simple algorithm is described which determines the satisfiability over the reals of a conjunction of linear inequalities none of which contains more than two variables in the worst case the algorithm requires time o mn lceil log 2 n rceil 3 where n is the number of variables and m the number of inequalities several considerations suggest that the algorithm may be useful in practice it is simple to implement it is fast for some important special cases and if the inequalities are satisfiable it provides valuable information about their so1ution set the algorithm is particularly suited to applications in mechanical program verification ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 78 689 cs tr 78 689 pdf
