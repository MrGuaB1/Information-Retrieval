in defense of the simplest quantified modal logic in defense of the simplest quantified modal logic authors bernard linsky and edward n zalta reference philosophical perspectives 8 1994 431 458 abstract the simplest quantified modal logic combines classical quantification theory with the propositional modal logic k the models of simple qml relativize predication to possible worlds and treat the quantifier as ranging over a single fixed domain of objects but this simple qml has features that are objectionable to actualists by contrast kripke models with their varying domains and restricted quantifiers seem to eliminate these features but in fact kripke models also have features to which actualists object though these philosophers have introduced variations on kripke models to eliminate their objectionable features the most well known variations all have difficulties of their own the present authors reexamine simple qml and discover that in addition to having a possibilist interpretation it has an actualist interpretation as well by introducing a new sort of existing abstract entity the contingently nonconcrete they show that the seeming drawbacks of the simplest qml are not drawbacks at all thus simple qml is independent of certain metaphysical questions preprint available online in pdf
