report number cs tr 98 1603 institution stanford university department of computer science title using complete machine simulation to understand computer system behavior author herrod stephen alan date march 1998 abstract this dissertation describes complete machine simulation a novel approach to understanding the behavior of modern computer systems complete machine simulation models all of the hardware found in modern computer systems allowing it to investigate the behavior of highly configurable machines running commercial operating systems and important workloads such as database and web servers complete machine simulation extends the applicability of traditional machine simulation techniques by addressing speed and data organization challenges to achieve the speed needed to investigate long running workloads complete machine simulation allows an investigator to dynamically adjust the characteristics of its hardware simulation an investigator can select a high speed low detail simulation setting to quickly pass through uninteresting portions of a workload's execution once the workload has reached a more interesting execution state an investigator can switch to slower more detailed simulation to obtain behavioral information to efficiently organize low level hardware simulation data into more useful information complete machine simulation provides several mechanisms that incorporate higher level workload knowledge into the data management process these mechanisms are efficient and further improve simulation speed by customizing all data collection and reporting to the specific needs of an investigation ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 98 1603 cs tr 98 1603 pdf
