report number cs tr 75 530 institution stanford university department of computer science title an adaptive finite difference solver for nonlinear two point boundary problems with mild boundary layers author lentini m author pereyra victor date november 1975 abstract a variable order variable step finite difference algorithm for approximately solving m dimensional systems of the form y f t y t in a b subject to the nonlinear boundary conditions g y a y b 0 is presented a program pasvar implementing these ideas has been written and the results on several test runs are presented together with comparisons with other methods the main features of the new procedure are a its ability to produce very precise global error estimates which in turn allow a very fine control between desired tolerance and actual output precision b non uniform meshes allow an economical and accurate treatment of boundary layers and other sharp changes in the solutions c the combination of automatic variable order via deferred corrections and automatic adaptive mesh selection produces as in the case of initial value problem solvers a versatile robust and efficient algorithm ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 75 530 cs tr 75 530 pdf
