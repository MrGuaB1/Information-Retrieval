stanford algebraic geometry seminar page 1 stanford algebraic geometry seminar deformation theory of morphisms of log schemes martin olsson berkeley abstract i will start by giving an overview of a stack theoretic approach to the theory of log geometry in the sense of fontaine illusie and kato as an application of this point of view i will explain how to generalize illusie's theory of the cotangent complex to the category of log schemes and discuss various applications to deformation theory problems in the category of log schemes no familiarity with log geometry will be assumed friday november 17 3 15 pm room 383 n http math stanford edu ag s0607
