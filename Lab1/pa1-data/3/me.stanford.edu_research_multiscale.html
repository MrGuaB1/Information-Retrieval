multi scale engineering stanford engineering intranet multi scale engineering 00 00 much of modern mechanical engineering research is intrinsically multi scale by its nature and this is a principal theme in me at stanford the primary goal of this work is to link our understanding of the physical world at very small scales with the observable performance of macroscopic systems examples include simulation of material behavior from the atomistic to the continuum level simulation of mass energy and momentum transport processes from the nanoscale to the continuum level nanoscale experiments and model development for materials research on the control and modeling of turbulence hierarchical design of mems devices for improved performance reliability study of the mechanical and transport physics in biological systems including cells tissue and molecules many of these topics feature nanoscales and or nanotechnology nanotechnology is the creation and utilization of functional materials devices and systems with novel properties and functions that are achieved through the control of matter atom by atom molecule by molecule or at the macromolecular level in a sense this represents the ultimate multi scale engineering field by virtue of the enormous range of scales involved faculty in the mechanics and computation group provide a focus for multi scale simulations and experiments on mechanical systems and faculty in the flow physics and computation group are making critical contributions to multi scale simulations ranging from energy conversion systems to molecular transport in biological systems faculty and students in thermosciences and design groups are focussed on experiments at micro and nanoscales which establish and verify the correct physical models for transport the nanotechnology revolution a revolution has begun in science based on our recent ability to organize characterize and manipulate matter systematically at the nanoscale the engineering and technology applications are only now beginning to emerge far reaching outcomes for the new century are envisioned in a wide range of technologies including advanced materials energy conversion and storage nanoelectronics biosensors and nanobiotechnology the faculty and students in the department are addressing the formidable challenges which remain not only in the area of fundamental understanding but also in device and system design manufacturing and system integration approaching the problem since nanosystems are of a size intermediate between isolated atoms and molecules and bulk materials understanding the behavior of nanosystems requires modeling large scale computer simulation and new tools for experimentation and for design approaches such as quantum mechanics molecular simulation grain and continuum based models and stochastic methods are all part of the study taking place within the department current me faculty expertise places the department at the confluence of theory fundamental experimentation and application me department groups biomechanical engineering design flow physics and computational engineering mechanics and computation thermosciences understanding the sense of touch the stanford microsystems lab teams with researchers in the medical school to study mechanobiology and the sense of touch in a model organism the nematode c elegans here a piezoresistive mems sensor designed by graduate student sung jin park is used in a feedback control system to apply calibrated loading profiles to the worms from mechanical and behavioral data researchers aim to construct a coupled mechanical model of the physiology of touch sensation click the image to see the video stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni themes that define us groups & programs faculty & research faculty directory affiliate programs faculty lookup by topic faculty open positions laboratories research centers ahpcrc cdr cits ctr research profiles research projects admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
