mechanical engineering stanford engineering intranet considering mechanical engineering the expanding role of mechanical engineers mechanical engineers build useful products for society they design and manufacture everything from medical devices to jet engines and they integrate computer chips into smart products mechanical engineers now reach far beyond the industries traditionally associated with the field such as transportation and power generation mechanical engineers are creating new important technologies that impact upon every aspect of our lives designing for a sustainable world recognizing that the environmental impact of the products we use has become a crucial design consideration stanford's mechanical engineering department has made this an important focus me's focus on sustainable design aligns with stanford's leadership position in promoting environmental sustainability helping societies lean how to meet the demands for energy food water and other vital needs without undermining the planet's precious resources combining excellence in education with service to society the goal of the undergraduate program in mechanical engineering is to provide students with a balance of intellectual and practical experiences that enable them to address a variety of societal needs our program at the undergraduate level prepares students for entry level work as mechanical engineers or for graduate study in engineering or in another discipline where a fundamental engineering background constitutes a desirable foundation with a solid grounding in the principles and practice of mechanical engineering our graduates are ready to engage in ethical approaches to engineering with concern for society and the environment me a broad discipline the mechanical engineering program is designed to provide students with a wide range of options within the field of mechanical engineering the discipline is very broad encompassing elements of these areas energy science and technology propulsion sensing and control nano and micro mechanics design mechatronics computational simulation solid and fluid dynamics microelectromechanical systems mems biomechanical engineering the five engineering themes around which the department is built make this broad based education possible biomedicine computational engineering design energy multi scale engineering the five programs within the department are built around these themes where a continued emphasis on fundamental understanding of a range of engineering and scientific concepts is combined with a sensitized empathy for human need the department's aim is to help produce academic and industry leaders we believe that because of our unique and forward thinking approach to research incorporating these five academic themes as well as our emphasis on human centered design and sustainability our graduates are widely sought after related topics scientists are trying to understand nature as engineers we are trying to serve society friedrich prinz me dept chair stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni prospective students undergraduate students applying bachelors degrees financial support graduate students applying doctor of philosophy financial support masters of science careers in me meet our students themes that define us groups & programs faculty & research admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
