report number cs tr 72 289 institution stanford university department of computer science title lakoff on linguistics and natural logic author wilks yorick a date june 1972 abstract the paper examines and criticises lakoff's notions of a natural logic and of a generative semantics described in terms of logic i argue that the relationship of these notions to logic as normally understood is unclear but i suggest in the course of the paper a number of possible interpretations of his thesis of generative semantics i argue further that on these interpretations the thesis of generative semantics is false unless it be taken as a mere notational variant of chomskyan theory i argue too that lakoff's work may provide a service in that it constitutes a reductio ad absurdum of the derivational paradigm of modern linguistics and shows inadvertently that only a system with the ability to reconsider its own inferences can do the job that lakoff sets up for linguistic enquiry that is to say only an artificial intelligence system ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 72 289 cs tr 72 289 pdf
