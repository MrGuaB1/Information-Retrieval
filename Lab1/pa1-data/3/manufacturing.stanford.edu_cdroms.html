hetm books cd rom's imany people have asked if we could send them a cd rom of our site we realize that a lot of people do not have a fast internet connection and because of this it's difficult to view the videos unfortunately we can t send cd rom's at this time because of copyright issues some of the companies who contributed video prefer that we maintain control over these videos by only offering them on the internet and not releasing them on cd rom however we are working on getting funding to develop a phase 2 of the website if we get funding we will work on creating a low bandwidth version of the course so those with low speed connections can better view the videos we appreciate your enthusiasm for the website and hope that we can serve you better in the future wish us luck on getting the funding workaround many teachers want to show one two or more videos to their class but only have a low speed connection so they can t watch it in real time there is a way to temporarily save the videos on your hard drive and then you can show the videos without having to connect to the internet simply click on a video and wait for 100 of it to download it is now in a temporary folder on your hard drive you can t find it or save it permanently though as long as you don t close the browser window or turn off your computer you will now be able to watch that video even if you re not connected to the internet you should be able to download multiple videos this way in succession and then show it to your class don t forget make sure 100 of the video downloads before going to the next video and don t close the browser window or turn off the computer let us know how this works
