cs157 homework submission policy cs157 homework submission policy late policy we will be following a strict late day policy any assignments submitted after 11 59pm on the due date will be docked 10 for each late calendar day so if an assignment is due on thursday and it is submitted at 12 00 midnight 1 minute late on thursday night 10 will automatically be deducted if it is submitted at 12 00 midnight on saturday 30 will be deducted and so on there is one major exception to this rule each student is allowed two 24 hour extensions that s he may apply to any homework no questions asked note that these extensions can be used for separate homework assignments or can be combined to make a single 48 hour extension for any single homework to let us know about your decision to apply an extension to a particular homework assignment you need to state this decision in the text of your submission for that assignment along with the number of extensions being used for the assignment the usual late day policy applies after the free extension has been used for example if you use both 24 hour extensions for homework 1 then you will get full credit if you submit your solutions before 11 59 pm on saturday since it is then becomes a 48 hour extension then you will have 10 off if you submit your solutions between 12 00 am sunday morning and 11 59 pm sunday night and so on these extensions are there for the purposes of emergencies medical or otherwise apart from this there will be no other extensions given out except under extreme circumstances if you feel this is the case contact the staff asap homeworks will not be accepted any more than 5 five days late save a copy finally please remember to save a copy of your homework in the unlikely event that something happens to it if we require another copy but you do not have one on hand you will have to type up your homework again c copyright 1997 2005 by michael genesereth
