managing uncertain data anish das sarma stanford university infolab the recent ubiquity of uncertain data in modern day applications such as data integration sensor networks and scientific experiments has resulted in a growing need for principled techniques in dealing with uncertainty at stanford we have been developing trio a system for managing data uncertainty and lineage in the first part of the talk i will describe some challenges in managing uncertain data in trio and how lineage helped us overcome them lineage allows for a simple yet expressive model for representing uncertain data and it enables efficient query processing the next part of the talk covers uncertain data management in the context of automated data integration i will describe a self configuring data integration system that produces high quality answers with no human intervention the system is based on probabilistic mediated schemas and schema mappings i will present results on the relative expressive power of probabilistic mediated schemas and mappings give algorithms for creating them and describe extensive experimental results finally i will describe briefly some of my other topics and results and my plans for future research
