report number cs tr 87 1188 institution stanford university department of computer science title experiments with a knowledge based system on a multiprocessor author nakano russell author minami masafumi date october 1987 abstract this paper documents the results we obtained and the lessons we learned in the design implementation and execution of a simulated real time application on a simulated parallel processor specifically our parallel program ran 100 times faster on a 100 processor multiprocessor the machine architecture is a distributed memory multiprocessor the target machine consists of 10 to 1000 processors but because of simulator limitations we ran simulations of machines consisting of 1 to 100 processors each processor is a computer with its own local memory executing an independent instruction stream there is no global shared memory all processes communicate by message passing the target programming environment called lamina encourages a programming style that stresses performance gains through problem decomposition allowing many processors to be brought to bear on a problem the key is to distribute the processing load over replicated objects and to incresase throughput by building pipelined sequences of objects that handle stages of problem solving we focused on a knowledge based application that simulates real time understanding of radar tracks called airtrac this paper describes a portion of the airtrac application implemented in lamina and a set of experiments that we performed we confirmed the following hypotheses 1 performance of our concurrent program improves with additional processors and thereby attains a significant level of speedup 2 correctness of our concurrent program can be maintained despite a high degree of problem decomposition and highly overloaded input data conditions ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 87 1188 cs tr 87 1188 pdf
