a leibnizian theory of concepts a leibnizian theory of concepts author edward n zalta reference philosophiegeschichte und logische analyse logical analysis and history of philosophy 3 2000 pp 137 183 abstract in this paper the author develops a theory of concepts and shows that it captures many of the ideas about concepts that leibniz expressed in his work concepts are first analyzed in terms of a precise background theory of abstract objects and once concept summation and concept containment are defined the axioms and theorems of leibniz's calculus of concepts in his logical papers are derived this analysis of concepts is then seamlessly connected with leibniz's modal metaphysics of complete individual concepts the fundamental theorem of leibniz's modal metaphysics of concepts is proved namely whenever an object x has f contingently then i the individual concept of x contains the concept f and ii there is a counterpart complete individual concept y which doesn t contain the concept f and which appears at some other possible world finally the author shows how the concept containment theory of truth can be made precise and made consistent with a modern conception of truth preprint available online in pdf
