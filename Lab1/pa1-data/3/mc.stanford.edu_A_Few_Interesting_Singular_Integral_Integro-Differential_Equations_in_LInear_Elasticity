mechanics and computation a few interesting singular integral integro differential equations in linear elasticity stanford mechanics and computation home people research teaching seminar schedule faq peter schiavone ph d university of alberta canada a few interesting singular integral integro differential equations in linear elasticity we review the contribution of various singular integral integro differential equations to a variety of interesting mathematical models in the linear theory of deformation of elastic solids in particular we include singular integral equations arising in the analysis of so called micropolar or cosserat materials singular integro differential equations developed from a linear theory of elastic boundary reinforcement for plane deformations of elastic solids and finally an interesting singular integro differential equation of cauchy type arising from a theory of linear elastic deformations incorporating surface mechanics via the surface elasticity model of gurtin and murdoch in each case we present analytical solutions of the corresponding boundary value problems in the form of either integral or complex potentials retrieved from http mc stanford edu cgi bin index php title a_few_interesting_singular_integral integro differential_equations_in_linear_elasticity&oldid 2361 member login log in page discussion view source history what links here related changes upload file special pages editing instructions
