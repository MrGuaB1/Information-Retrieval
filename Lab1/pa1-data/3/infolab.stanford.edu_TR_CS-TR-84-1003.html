report number cs tr 84 1003 institution stanford university department of computer science title parallelism and greedy algorithms author anderson richard author mayr ernst date april 1984 abstract a number of greedy algorithms are examined and are shown to be probably inherently sequential greedy algorithms are presented for finding a maximal path for finding a maximal set of disjoint paths in a layered dag and for finding the largest induced subgraph of a graph that has all vertices of degree at least k it is shown that for all of these algorithms the problem of determining if a given node is in the solution set of the algorithm is p complete this means that it is unlikely that these sequential algorithms can be sped up significantly using parallelism ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 84 1003 cs tr 84 1003 pdf
