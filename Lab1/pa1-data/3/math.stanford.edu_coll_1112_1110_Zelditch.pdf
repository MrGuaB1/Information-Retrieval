special topics in group theory page 1 department colloquium thursday november 10 4 15pm building 380 room 380 w steven zelditch northwestern university geometry of nodal sets of eigenfunctions abstract a classic problem on modes of vibration of drums or more generally on eigenfunctions of the laplacian on riemannian manifold is to determine how the nodal zero set snakes around the manifold after reviewing classic and new results on volumes of nodal hypersurfaces i will present results on the complex zeros of analytic continuations to the complex domain just as in algebraic geometry the complex zeros are more accessible than the real zeros
