swami abstract set oriented mining for association rules in relational databases dr arun swami silicon graphics inc mountain view ca 94120 6099 email arun cs stanford edu abstract data mining is an important real life application for businesses it is critical to find efficient ways of mining large data sets in order to benefit from the experience with relational databases a set oriented approach to mining data is needed in such an approach the data mining operations are expressed in terms of relational or set oriented operations query optimization technology can then be used for efficient processing in this talk we address the problem of developing set oriented algorithms for mining association rules in large databases we develop new algorithms that can be expressed as sql queries and discuss optimization of these algorithms after analytical evaluation an algorithm named setm emerges as the algorithm of choice algorithm setm uses only simple database primitives viz sorting and merge scan join the set oriented nature of algorithm setm makes it possible to develop extensions easily and its performance makes it feasible to build interactive data mining tools for large databases joint work with m houtsma telematics research center the netherlands papers related to talk data mining with silicon graphics technology using a challenge server to build a 200 gb data warehouse
