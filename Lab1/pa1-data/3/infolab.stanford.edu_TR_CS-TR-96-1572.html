report number cs tr 96 1572 institution stanford university department of computer science title caching and non horn inference in model elimination theorem provers author geddis donald f date june 1996 abstract caching in an inference procedure holds the promise of replacing exponential search with constant time lookup at a cost of slightly increased overhead for each node expansion caching will be useful if subgoals are repeated often enough during proofs in experiments on solving queries using a backward chainer on horn theories caching appears to be very helpful on average when trying to extend this success to first order theories however intuition suggests that subgoal caches are no longer useful the cause is that complete first order backward chaining requires goal goal resolutions in addition to resolutions with the database and this introduces a context sensitivity into the proofs for a subgoal a cache is only feasible if the solutions are independent of context so that they may be copied from one part of the space to another it is shown here that a full exploration of a subgoal in one context actually provides complete information about the solutions to the same subgoal in all other contexts of the proof in a straightforward way individual solutions from one context may be copied over directly more importantly non horn failure caching is also feasible so no additional solutions in the new context that might affect the query are possible and therefore there is no need to re explore the space in the new context thus most horn clause caching schemes may be used with minimal changes in a non horn setting in addition a new horn clause caching scheme is proposed postponement caching this new scheme involves exploring the inference space as a graph instead of as a tree so that a given literal will only occur once in the proof space despite the previous extension of failure caching to non horn theories postponement caching is incomplete in the non horn case a counterexample is presented and possible enhancements to reclaim completeness are investigated ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 96 1572 cs tr 96 1572 pdf
