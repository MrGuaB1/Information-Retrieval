report number cs tr 78 674 institution stanford university department of computer science title finite element approximation and iterative solution of a class of mildly non linear elliptic equations author chan tony f author glowinski roland date november 1978 abstract we describe in this report the numerical analysis of a particular class of nonlinear dirichlet problems we consider an equivalent variational inequality formulation on which the problems of existence uniqueness and approximation are easier to discuss we prove in particular the convergence of an approximation by piecewise linear finite elements finally we describe and compare several iterative methods for solving the approximate problems and particularly some new algorithms of augmented lagrangian type which contain as special case some well known alternating direction methods numerical results are presented ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 78 674 cs tr 78 674 pdf
