el gamal's research group at stanford university overview publications links 3d field programmable gate array fpga architecture design fpga can be used as flexible logic resources for encryption error corrections address generations etc though fpga based implementation requires fewer design iterations and has the advantage of shorter time to market the system performance and logic density in fpga based implementation is not as high as fullcustom designs due to the area and performance overhead of programmable interconnects in some recent studies it has been found that in sram based fpgas 40 80 of overall design delay and 90 of chip area are attributed to programmable interconnects one possible solution to solve this problem is to employ 3d ic technology to implement fpga a 3d implementation of the fpga will greatly improve the integration density and performance especially if the 3d integration technology supports a high density of vertical interconnects however in order to fully take advantage of 3d ic technology many design tradeoffs of fpga architecture have to be thoroughly understood this project aims to optimize the fpga architecture using 3d ic technology for general purpose and special signal processing applications faculty prof abbas el gamal student mingjie lin funding darpa
