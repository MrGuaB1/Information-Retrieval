report number csl tr 75 96 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title a rollback interval for networks with an imperfect self checking property author shedletsky john j date december 1975 abstract dynamic self checking is a technique used in computers to detect a fault quickly before extensive data contamination caused by the fault can occur when the self checking properties of the computer circuits are not perfect as in the case with self testing only and partially self checking circuits the recovery procedure may be required to roll back program execution to a point prior to the first undetected data error caused by the detected fault this paper presents a method by which the rollback distance required to achieve a given probability of successful data restoration may be calculated to facilitate this method operational interpretations are given to familiar network properties such as the self testing secureness and self checking properties an arithmetic and logic unit with imperfect self checking capability is analyzed to determine the minimum required rollback distance for the recovery procedure ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 75 96 csl tr 75 96 pdf
