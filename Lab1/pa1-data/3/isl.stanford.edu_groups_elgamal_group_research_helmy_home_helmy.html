el gamal's research group at stanford university overview publications links photometric biosensing lab on chip there is a growing interest in the development of inexpensive techniques and portable biosensors for environmental and biomedical diagnostics of interest is developing techniques and sensors not only to selectively identify target compounds ie for infectious disease detection but also to assay large numbers of samples problems remain in detection and quantification of low levels of biological compounds reliably conveniently safely and quickly despite efforts to develop chips for biological assay detection there continues to be a need to improve implementations of micro scale detection and processing systems for further convenience scaling and portability indeed current systems cost in excess of tens of thousands of dollars require large biological sample sizes are bulky high power require dedicated computers and are hence not suited for portability or massive parallelization to address these needs and in collaboration with the stanford genome technology center and the stanford nanofabrication group we are designing and building a portable cmos based lab on chip that is suitable for a variety of applications such as for dna sequencing gene expression analysis and pathogen detection the lab on chip consists of two substrates a high sensitivity cmos based luminescence detection soc and a tightly coupled microfluidic array for sample and reagent handling the detection soc is capable of detecting signals below 10 6 lux over a 30 second integration time at room temperature the system and associated developed chemistries and algorithms will be used to improve the throughput and significantly lower the cost of current de novo dna sequencing approaches faculty prof abbas el gamal prof ron davis dr peter griffin dr mostafa ronaghi students ali agah helmy eltoukhy khaled salama funding darpa nih
