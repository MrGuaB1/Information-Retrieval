report number cs tn 96 29 institution stanford university department of computer science title the optimization complexity of constraint satisfaction problems author khanna sanjeev author sudan madhu date december 1995 abstract in 1978 schaefer considered a subclass of languages in np and proved a dichotomy theorem for this class the subclass considered were problems expressible as constraint satisfaction problems and the dichotomy theorem showed that every language in this class is either in p or is np hard this result is in sharp contrast to a result of ladner which shows that such a dichotomy does not hold for np unless np p we consider optimization version of the dichotomy question and show an analog of schaefer's result for this case more specifically we consider optimization version of constraint satisfaction problems and show that every optimization problem in this class is either solvable exactly in p or is max snp hard and hence not approximable to within some constant factor in polynomial time unless np p this result does not follow directly from schaefer's result in particular the set of problems that turn out to be hard in this case is quite different from the set of languages which are shown hard by schaefer's result ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tn 96 29 cs tn 96 29 pdf
