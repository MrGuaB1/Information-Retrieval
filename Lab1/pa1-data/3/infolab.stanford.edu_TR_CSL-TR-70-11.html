report number csl tr 70 11 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title the spoof a new technique for analyzing the effects of faults on logic networks author clegg frederick w date august 1970 abstract in general one cannot predict the effects of possible failures on the functional characteristics of a logic network without knowledge of the structure of that network the spoof or structure and parity observing output function described in this report provides a new and convenient means of characterizing both network structure and output function in a single algebraic expression a straightforward method for the determination of a spoof for any logic network is demonstrated similarities between spoof's and other means of characterizing network structure are discussed examples are presented which illustrate the ease with which the effects of any stuck at fault single or multiple on the functional characteristics of a logic network are determined using spoof's ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 70 11 csl tr 70 11 pdf
