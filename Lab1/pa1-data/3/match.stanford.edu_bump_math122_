group representation theory math 122 group representation theory spring 2011 in addition to the book abstract algebra by dummit and foote i have written some lecture notes on group representation theory which you may find here group representation theory by daniel bump this should be viewable with most modern browsers if you need to print a page you may want to get out of its frame just change gind to gr in the url for example if you are looking at this page http match stanford edu bump group gind2_7 html and you want to print it first go to this page http match stanford edu bump group gr2_7 html then you should be able to print in the usual way office hours office hours my office is 383u i will have office hours tu w f from 10 30 11 30 subject to change homeworks homeworks will be due on wednesdays this is not a class day late homeworks will probably not be accepted after they have been given to the grader first homework due wed april 6 dummit and foote section 18.1 p 852 3 13 14 16 20 second homework due wed april 13 dummit and foote section 18.1 p 852 6 b and c also for this problem give the characters of the representations also p 852 17 and on page 863 16 17 18 third homework due wed april 20 problems on page 877 4 5 7 11 13 26 fourth homework due wed april 27 produce character tables for the following groups explain how you obtained the answer just writing down the character table with no explanation is not enough you need to find representatives for each conjugacy class the number of elements of the conjugacy class and then compute by one method or another all the irreducible characters the group d10 use the presentation g langle x y x 5 y 2 1 yxy 1 x 1 rangle the group d12 use the presentation g langle x y x 6 y 2 1 yxy 1 x 1 rangle the following group of order 55 g langle x y x 11 y 5 1 yxy 1 x 3 rangle this is similar to the nonabelian group of order 21 which i did in class on thursday or the nonabelian group of order 39 which is done in the notes the symmetric group s_5 hints you may find it useful to consider the permutation action on 5 sylow subgroups as i did in class there is a character of degree 6 that might be hard to find but remember there are tricks so that if you know all but one character you can compute the last one fifth homework one problem only page 886 number 17 this was not collected this week and will not be due until next week may 11 supplement it with the following problems on induced characters also due may 11 exercise a let g a_5 and let h be a cyclic subgroup of order 5 let psi h to mathbb c times be a nontrivial linear character choose an explicit one compute the induced character psi g this was done in class but write it up exercise b let g be a finite group and a an abelian subgroup let chi be an irreducible character of g show that there is a linear character psi of a such that left chi psi g right ne 0 hint use frobenius reciprocity ponder how exercise b might lead you to try the induced character in exercise a if you are trying to construct the three dimensional irreducible characters of a_5 project due may 20 pdf file last homework due wed may 25 page 902 2 3 4 lecture notes schur orthogonality i did not follow the book in proving schur orthogonality here is my lecture of april 12 exams there will be one in class midterm and a project which will be treated as a take home midterm the date for the in class midterm is may 5 what will be relevant for the midterm you will definitely be asked to compute a character table giving complete reasons for each character you will be responsible for understanding maschke's theorem schur's lemma including why it is true and applications of it you will of course be expected to know the orthogonality relations for characters and to be able to apply them however i will not ask you to prove the orthogonality relations you should understand the group algebra and why modules over the group algebra are the same as representations you should understand the regular representation and its character and characters of permutation representations group actions the project will be assigned right after the midterm and will be due 2 weeks later on may 20 final will be monday june 6 7 10 pm in 380d i made a statement about the final on thursday and privately repeated it to the one person who wasn t in class i find i don t have much to add to that there will be a character table an induced character and those portions of sections 9.2 and 9.3 that were covered in class will be fair game except that i won t ask you to prove the facts about algebraic integers nothing about hall's theorem since i didn t cover it if you have any further questions about the contents of the final please email me
