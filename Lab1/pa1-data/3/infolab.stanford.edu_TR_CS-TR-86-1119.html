report number cs tr 86 1119 institution stanford university department of computer science title simulation of an ultracomputer with several hot spots author rosenblum david s author mayr ernst w date june 1986 abstract this report describes the design and results of a time driven simulation of an ultracomputer like multiprocessor in the presence of several hot spots or memory modules which are frequent targets of requests such hot spots exist during execution of parallel programs in which the several threads of control synchronize through manipulation of a small number of shared variables the simulated system is comprised of n processing elements pes and n shared memory modules connected by an n x n buffered packet switched omega network the simulator was designed to accept a wide variety of system configurations to enable observation of many different characteristics of the system behavior we present the results of four experiments 1 general simulation of several 16 pe configurations 2 general simulation of several 512 pe configurations 3 determination of critical queue lengths as a function of request rate 512 pes and 4 determination of the effect of hot spot spacing on system performance 512 pes ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 86 1119 cs tr 86 1119 pdf
