stanford algebraic geometry seminar page 1 stanford algebraic geometry seminar drinfeld modular varieties and curves with many rational points mihran papikian stanford abstract almost 60 years ago andre weil proved a formula for the number of rational points on a smooth projective algebraic curve c of genus g over a finite field fq this formula known as the riemann hypothesis for curves provides an upper bound on the maximum number of rational points possible c fq q 1 2g q there are many cases in which weil's bound cannot be attained in fact when g is large compared to q this inequality can be improved significantly let nq g be the maximum number of fq rational points on any curve over fq of genus g the weil bound implies that for q fixed lim g nq g g 2 q but as drinfeld and vladut proved this bound can be improved to q 1 in order to test the sharpness of the drinfeld vladut bound it is necessary to produce curves with many points there are different approaches to this question manin and vladut used supersingular points on drinfeld modular curves to show that the drinfeld vladut bound is in fact sharp when q is a square in my talk which will be mostly expository i shall explain manin vladut construction and indicate a possible application of higher dimensional drinfeld modular varieties to the same question friday november 4 3 15 pm room 383 n http math stanford edu vakil s0506
