peritoneum & pelvic floor fascias & fat function the peritoneum has a secretory capability and its fluid usually about 5 10ml collects in the rectouterine pouch acting as a lubricant for preventing adhesions among mobile pelvic organs and permitting the bowel loops that hang into the pelvic sac to glide freely around them the absence of ovarian peritoneum allows the ovulatory function of the ovary to occur successfully the peritoneal sac constitutes an anatomic boundary of squamous epithelium that delimits its contents from surrounding structures it therefore serves patients by inhibiting the spread of some diseases and clinicians as a landmark for their diagnosis and therapy
