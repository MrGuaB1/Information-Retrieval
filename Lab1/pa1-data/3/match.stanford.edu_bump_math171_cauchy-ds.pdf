cauchy sequences in r page 1 cauchy sequences in r daniel bump october 14 2010 a sequence an of real numbers is called a cauchy sequence if for every  0 there exists an n such that an am  whenever n m n the goal of this note is to prove that every cauchy sequence is convergent this is proved in the book but the proof we give is different since we do not rely on the bolzano weierstrass theorem we will call the sequence an is increasing if whenever n m we have an am if whenever n m we have an am we will call the sequence strictly increasing similarly the sequence an is decreasing whenever n m we have an am and strictly decreasing if n m implies that an am proposition 1 i let an be a bounded increasing sequence of real num bers then the sequence an is convergent the limit of the sequence coin 1 page 2 cides with its least upper bound ii if an is a bounded decreasing sequence then the sequence an con verges to its greatest lower bound proof the proof of ii is similar to i we will prove i leaving ii to the reader since the set of an is bounded it has a least upper bound l we will prove that lim n an l let  0 be given we must show that there exists an n such that if n n then an l  first we note that there exists a positive integer n such that an l  indeed if no such an exists then l  is an upper bound for the set of an which is a contradiction since l is the least upper bound and l  l now we may show that if n n then an l  indeed we have an an since n n and the sequence an is increasing since an l  this means that an l  on the other hand an l since l is an upper bound thus l  an l this implies that an l  and the proof is complete d 2 page 3 lemma 1 a cauchy sequence is bounded proof let an be a cauchy sequence by the definition of a cauchy sequence with  1 there exists an n such that if n m n then an am 1 pick any n0 n we will show that for any n we have an b where b max a1 a2 an0 1 an0 1 there are two cases if n n0 then an b by the definition of b on the other hand if n n0 then n n0 n and so an an0 1 therefore an an0 an an0 an0 an an0 an0 1 b as required we have proved that an is bounded d theorem 1 let an be a cauchy sequence of real numbers then the se quence an is convergent proof let us associate with the sequence an two other sequences ln and rn we define ln to be the greatest lower bound of the subsequence an an 1 an 2 1 3 page 4 note that this greatest bound exists since by lemma 1 because this is a sub sequence of a bounded sequence hence bounded clearly ln min an ln 1 therefore ln ln 1 and so the sequence ln is increasing it is bounded since if an b for all n then ln b by proposition 1 the sequence ln is convergent similarly we define rn to be the least upper bound of the subsequence 1 by the same reasoning rn is a bounded decreasing sequence hence convergent let lim n ln l lim n rn r we will show that l r suppose that l r since ln is a lower bound of the subsequence 1 and rn is an upper bound we have ln rn for all n therefore l r thus l r implies that l r let  1 3 r l because the sequence an is cauchy there exists some integer n such that if n m n then an am  because ln is the greatest lower bound of the sequence an an 1 there exists n n such that an ln  recalling that by proposition 1 the limit l is the least upper bound of ln we have ln l and therefore an ln  l  similarly for some 4 page 5 m n we have am r  now am an am an r  l  r l 2  which is a contradiction we have proved that r l now we will prove that lim n an l 2 let  0 be given since l is the least upper bound of ln and the greatest lower bound of rn there exists a positive integer n such that 0 l ln  and 0 rn l  thus l  ln rn l  if n n then since ln is the greatest lower bound of an an 1 an 2 and rn is the least upper bound of this sequence we have ln an rn therefore l  an l  and so an l  this proves 2 d 5
