programming tips for paradis micro and nano mechanics group micro and nano mechanics group main page community portal current events recent changes random page help this page is intended to developers of the paradis code we share a few programming tips we discover in paradis the peach koehler force exerted on a dislocation line element  with burgers vector b by a stress  is given by the way this force is implemented in paradis is as follows see computesegsigbrem in nodeforce c consider two neighboring nodes node 1 and node 2 we want to compute the force on each of these nodes suppose these nodes have coordinates x 1 and x 2 respectively 1 the dot product is computed for each ordered pair node 1 node 2 each node gets the same where here b 1 is the burgers vector of node 1 note that nodes are ordered in paradis and only the pair node 1 node 2 is considered and not node 2 node 1 in this case 2 this dot product is then use to calculate the peach koehler force node 1 gets the force and node 2 gets the force retrieved from http micro stanford edu wiki programming_tips_for_paradis member login log in page discussion view source history what links here related changes upload file special pages
