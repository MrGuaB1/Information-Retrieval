mediation to deal with heterogeneous data sources mediation to deal with heterogeneous data sources gio wiederhold vckovski brassel and schek interoperating geographic information systems springer lncs 1580 proc interop 99 zurich march 1999 pages 1 16 paper the objective of interoperation is to increase the value of information when information from multiple sources is accessed related and combined however care is required to realize this benefit one problem to be addressed in this context is that a simple integration over the ever expanding number of resources available on line leads to what customers perceive as information overload in actuality the customers experience data overload making it nearly impossible for them to extract relevant points of information out of a huge haystack of data we cite architectural alternatives as database integration warehousing and then focus on a three layer mediated architecture in the interoperation paradigm we favor that information merging is performed as the need arises relying on articulation points that have been found and defined earlier in many applications geographical markers present such articulation points the architecture we presented allows multiple application hierarchies to be overlaid so that the structure forms a directed acyclic graph from client to resource although the information flow is in the opposite direction the complexity is still an order less than that implied by arbitrary networks simplifying composition both in terms of research and operational management
