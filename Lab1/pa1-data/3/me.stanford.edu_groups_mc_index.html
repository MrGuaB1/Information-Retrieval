mechanics & computation group index page stanford engineering intranet home people research teaching seminar schedule faq introduction teaching and research in the mechanics and computation group is devoted to the study of a broad range of mechanical phenomena including the behavior of solids fluids biological tissue and complex materials under the actions of loads the ultimate goals of this effort are to discover new scientific knowledge relevant to engineering problems of the future to enhance technological development in a broad range of industries to improve health in society and to advance national security and defense much of the research conducted within the group is interdisciplinary in nature reflecting a combination of concepts methods and principles that often span several areas of mechanics mathematics computer sciences materials science biology and numerous other scientific disciplines our approach often combines experimental or clinical studies with theoretical modeling and numerical simulation to create tools that both explain phenomena and predict behavior and that may be used to advance concepts and designs in industry to achieve our educational objectives our teaching and research encompasses computational mechanics multiphysics modeling computational bioengineering and microscale devices where to find us the mechanics and computation group is located in the william f durand building the building provides offices computer facilities research laboratories and seminar rooms for faculty research associates and graduate students of the group news and events check out our seminar more photo gallery click here for full gallery stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni themes that define us groups & programs biomechanical engineering design flow physics & computation mechanics & computation thermosciences faculty & research admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
