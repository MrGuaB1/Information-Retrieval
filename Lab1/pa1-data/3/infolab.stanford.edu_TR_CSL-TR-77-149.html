report number csl tr 77 149 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title interpretive machines author iliffe john k date june 1977 abstract these lectures survey attempts to apply computers directly to high level languages using microprogrammed interpreters the motivation for such work is to achieve language implementations that are more effective in some measure of translation execution or response to the user than would otherwise be obtained the implied comparison is with the established technique of compiling into a fixed general purpose machine code prior to execution it is argued that while substantial benefits can be expected from microprogramming it does not represent the best approach to design when the contributing factors are analyzed in a general system context that is to say when wide performance range multiple source language and stringent security requirements have to be satisfied an alternative is suggested using a combination of interpretation and a primitive instruction set and providing security at the microprogram level ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 77 149 csl tr 77 149 pdf
