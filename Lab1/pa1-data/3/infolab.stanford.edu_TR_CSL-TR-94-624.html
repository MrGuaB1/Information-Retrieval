report number csl tr 94 624 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title wsim a symbolic waveform simulator author franco piero author mccluskey edward j date june 1994 abstract a symbolic waveform simulator is proposed in this report the delay of faulty element is treated as a variable in the generation of the output waveform therefore many timing simulations with different delay values do not have to be done to analyze the behavior of the circuit under test with the timing fault the motivation for this work was to investigate delay testing by output waveform analysis where an accurate representation of the actual waveforms is required although the simulator can be used for other applications as well such as power analysis output waveform analysis will be briefly reviewed followed by a description of both a simplified and a complete implementation of the waveform simulator and simulation results ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 94 624 csl tr 94 624 pdf
