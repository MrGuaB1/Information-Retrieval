naturalized platonism vs platonized naturalism naturalized platonism vs platonized naturalism authors bernard linsky and edward n zalta reference journal of philosophy xcii 10 october 1995 525 555 forthcoming abstract naturalism is the realist ontology that admits only those objects required by the explanations of the natural sciences but both mathematical objects and properties are needed to explain scientific theories and scientific laws to account for our knowledge of properties and mathematical objects some naturalist philosophers have introduced these entities into the causal order arguing that truths about them are empirical discovered a posteriori and subject to revision this naturalized platonism has certain intrinsic problems in this paper we develop an alternative strategy platonized naturalism to account for our knowledge of mathematical objects and properties a systematic principled platonism based on a comprehension principle that asserts the existence of a plenitude of abstract objects is not just consistent with but required on transcendental grounds for naturalism such a comprehension principle is synthetic and it is known a priori its synthetic a priori character is grounded in the fact that it is an essential part of the logic in which any scientific theory will be formulated and so underlies our understanding of the meaningfulness of any such theory this is why it is required for naturalism moreover the comprehension principle satisfies naturalist standards of reference knowledge and ontological parsimony as part of our argument we identify mathematical objects as abstract individuals in the domain governed by the comprehension principle and we show that our knowledge of mathematical truths is linked to our knowledge of that principle preprint available online in pdf
