interbib release notes for 2007 overhaul interbib release notes for 2007 overhaul after operating for 12 years unattended interbib was out of commission for a while because python had changed so much that a python upgrade broke the code i fixed some features added some new ones but also left some languishing due to time constraints rtf conversion does not work right now mif has not been tested in a while html conversion of bibliographies and addition of bibliographies into html documents works interoperability with endnote has been greatly improved for local operation there are now endnote2bib and bib2endnote scripts the refer2bib and bib2refer facility now sticks to official refer we now call that format strict refer note interbib's default file extension for bibliography files that conform endnote's extensions to refer is enr for endnote refer local operation via the scripts is possible if you download and install interbib on your own machine see below the latex comment character is now recognized in bibtex files as a comment even when it's not at the start of a line percentage signs in strings are protected fixed a bug that misunderstood signs inside of strings regarding translations to and from endnote urls in a bibtex url field translate properly to u and vice versa bibtex keys are preserved via f for use in endnote string macros in bibtex work i did my best with the translation of latex special chars to from latin1 to migrate a bibtex file to endnote use interbib to convert the file to an endnote enr endnote refer file and import the result into endnote during this conversion process you can merge bibtex refer and other endnote refer exported bibliographies from local files and locations on the web into a single bibtex endnote or strict refer file on your local machine as an example for using the command line way of doing the bibtex to endnote conversion if you decided to install your local interbib copy bib2endnote mybiblio bib mybiblio enr you need to remove the few lines of error warning reports at the end of the resulting enr file importing the enr file to endnote using the application's built in referbibix input filter works ok you ll get better results if you use the interbib import filter that i put together it matches bibtex fields to endnote a bit better than endnote's standard refer filter after downloading the filter file you place it in the endnote installation directory's filters subdirectory to migrate an endnote bibliography to bibtex export it from endnote using the referbibix output style then use interbib to convert to bibtex see below for a couple of instructions on how best to do the export from endnote you can download a distribution of this interbib release from the interbib home page gunzip untar run make the system will work both on your local machine in command line mode under linux or cygwin or you can run it over the web you ll need python in either case python 2.5 1 under cygwin works fine so does python 2.2 3 under linux if you are a python programmer and willing to chip in i d like to resurrect the ability to add bibliographies into word documents a previous interbib version did this through rtf rather than fixing the rtf module i d love to have that module modified to work with word 2007's xml instead if you are interested please email me at endnote customization for importing interbib bibtex files get author names right edit import filters open filter manager select referbibix or interbib if you installed the interbib filter click edit under author parsing set name order to first always precedes last have endnote use the bibtex key instead of an internally generated record number edit preferences temporary citations check use field instead of record number select label endnote exporting for subsequent interbib translations to other formats like bibtex edit output styles open style manager select endnote export and click on it make sure no citation is selected or select all of them file export txt file
