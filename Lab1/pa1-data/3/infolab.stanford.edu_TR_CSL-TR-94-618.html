report number csl tr 94 618 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title optimum routing of multicast audio and video streams in communications networks author noronha ciro a jr author tobagi fouad a date april 94 abstract in this report we consider the problem of routing multicast audio and video streams in a communications network after describing the previous work in the area and identifying its shortcomings we show that the problem of optimally routing multicast streams can be formulated as an integer programming problem we propose an efficient solution technique composed of two parts i an extension to the decomposition principle to speed up the linear relaxation of the problem and ii enhanced value fixing rules to prune the search space for the integer problem we characterize the reduction in run time gained using these techniques finally we compare the run times for the optimum multicast routing algorithm and for existing heuristic algorithms ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 94 618 csl tr 94 618 pdf
