boundedness next up previous next paradoxes up sets previous sets boundedness as mentioned earlier the key difference between bounded and unbounded objects is that the former can be members of other sets while the latter cannot this fact establishes a necessary and sufficient test for boundedness an object is bounded just in case it is a member of a set however this is not very helpful since we often need to determine whether or not an object is bounded based on other properties not the sets of which it is a member in this section we look at some axioms that help us make this determination for sets first of all we have the finite set axiom any finite set of bounded sets is itself a bounded set bounded setof l the subset axiom assures that the set of all of subsets of a bounded set is also a bounded set bounded v bounded setofall u subset u v the union axiom tells us that the generalized union of any bounded set of bounded sets is also a bounded set since every finite set is bounded this allows us to conclude as a special case that the union of any finite number of bounded sets is a bounded set and bounded u forall x member x u bounded x bounded generalized union u the intersection axiom tells us that the intersection of a bounded set and any other set is a bounded set so long as one of the sets defining the intersection is bounded the resulting set is bounded and bounded u set s bounded intersection u s finally we have the axiom of infinity there is a bounded set containing a set a set that properly contains that set a third set that properly contains the second set and so forth in short there is at least one bounded set of infinite cardinality exists u and bounded u not empty u forall x member x u exists y and member y u proper subset x y vishal i sikka wed dec 7 13 23 42 pst 1994
