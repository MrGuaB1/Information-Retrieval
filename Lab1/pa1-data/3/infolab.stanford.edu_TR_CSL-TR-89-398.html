report number csl tr 89 398 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title the relative effects of optimization on instruction architecture performance author cuderman kj author flynn mj date october 1989 abstract the stanford architect's workbench is a simulation platform used to evaluate the impact of optimization on the relative performance of instruction set architectures the total impact optimization makes on an application is the combined interaction of the optimizer the architecture and the cache configuration the relative performance of seven architectures are compared using a suite of six application programs optimization reduces the number of executed instructions but its effectiveness varies with architecture register architectures capitalize on temporaries introduced by optimization without incurring penalties for moving data short instructions for register operations reduce the instruction bandwidth in addition to reducing the number of instructions reducing the number of executed instructions does not yield a reduction in memory traffic optimization only slightly alters the program working set size an instruction cache quickly masks the effect of optimization the result is that the instruction memory traffic remains almost constant for an application ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 89 398 csl tr 89 398 pdf
