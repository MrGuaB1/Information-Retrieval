report number csl tr 82 231 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title dynamic detection of concurrency in del instruction streams author wedig robert g date february 1982 abstract detection of concurrency in directly executed languages del is investigated it is theorized that if dels provide a minimal time space execution of serial programs then concurrency detection of such instruction streams approaches the minimum execution time possible for a single task without resorting to algorithm restructuring or source manipulation it is shown how del encodings facilitate the detection of concurrency by allowing early decoding and explicity detection of dependency information the decoding and dependency algorithms as applied to dels are developed in detail concurrency structures are presented which facilitate the detection process since all concurrency is capable of exploitation as soon as it is known that the code is to be executed ie the result of the branch is known it is proven that all explicit parallelism can be detected and exploited using the techniques developed ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 82 231 csl tr 82 231 pdf
