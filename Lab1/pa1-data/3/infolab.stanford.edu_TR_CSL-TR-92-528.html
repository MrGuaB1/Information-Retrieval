report number csl tr 92 528 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title binary multiplication using partially redundant multiples author bewick gary author flynn michael j date june 1992 abstract this report presents an extension to booth's algorithm for binary multiplication most implementations that utilize booth's algorithm use the 2 bit version which reduces the number of partial products required to half that required by a simple add and shift method further reduction in the number of partial products can be obtained by using higher order versions of booth's algorithm but it is necessary to generate multiples of one of the operands such as 3 times an operand by the use of a carry propagate adder this carry propagate addition introduces significant delay and additional hardware the algorithm described in this report produces such difficult multiples in a partially redundant form using a series of small length adders these adders operate in parallel with no carries propagating between them as a result the delay introduced by multiple generation is minimized and the hardware needed for the multiple generation is also reduced due to the elimination of expensive carry lookahead logic ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 92 528 csl tr 92 528 pdf
