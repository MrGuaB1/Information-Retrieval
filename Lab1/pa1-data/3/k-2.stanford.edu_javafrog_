jumping javafrog the jumping java frog game the jumping java frog game is an interactive 2 d java applet that teaches children about simple frog behavior eating jumping survival as well as simple projectile motion the goal of this game is to teach biology and physics in an integrative interdisciplinary manner and to motivate students to learn through the use of an entertaining and challenging medium you can read the instructions for playing or if you would like to jump right in and start playing the game simply click on the screen shot above there are two major modes of operation in this game the first mode is the skill development mode where the student learns about angular measures weight force and parabolic trajectories the student is taught how to make a frog jump in an optimal manner using a minimum amount of energy in the process the student develops an understanding of simple projectile motion the second mode is the survival game in which the student uses the skills he she has developed to help a frog eat and survive the student wins points for eating flies thereby increasing their energy store while at the same time must avoid being eaten by predators in this case birds when threatened by a bird the student must make the frog jump into a pond if the frogs misses the pond it becomes disabled for a certain number of seconds before jumping again if the frog eats too much food it becomes too massive to jump efficiently likewise if the frog eats too little it becomes weak and unable to jump effectively learning activities mensuration angles distances forces food energy survival physics motion laws design components background environment animated frog animated fly animated bird sound effects frog ribbit fly buzzing bird screech water splash control panel angle dial force dial energy meter food store scrolling background optional force feedback optional
