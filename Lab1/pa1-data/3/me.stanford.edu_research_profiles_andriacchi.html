department of mechanical engineering research profiles stanford engineering intranet printable pdf tom andriacchi new technology developments markerless motion capture the lab conducts pioneering work on the development of a markerless method for the capture of three dimensional human movements this technique avoids the problems inherent in conventional marker based methods while maintaining the same accuracy this new ability to capture unencumbered movement in a natural setting could open a new era in the study of human movement an illustration of the markerless motion capture methods applied to sports activities clinical applications osteoarthritis is a progressive degeneration of cartilage that afflicts a large portion of the aging population the lab has combined magnetic resonance imaging mri methods with gait analysis to identify relationships between gait mechanics and cartilage changes for healthy and injured diseased knees analysis of the walking patterns of patients with degenerative changes osteoarthritis of the medial compartment of the knee joint identified dynamic load factors that influence treatment outcome recent work has produced a shoe design to change walking mechanics to reduce the rate of progression of osteoarthritis at knee this shoe recently completed a successful clinical trial anterior cruciate ligament injury acl the acl is one of the four major ligaments of the knee and frequently injured during sports activity such as basketball soccer or volleyball while landing on a single limb and stopping or pivoting the lab is currently using the markerless motion capture method to analyze the mechanics of the acl injury we are also looking at the functional implications of acl surgical reconstruction to create objective guidelines for the surgical placement of the acl graft stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni themes that define us groups & programs faculty & research faculty directory affiliate programs faculty lookup by topic faculty open positions laboratories research centers ahpcrc cdr cits ctr research profiles research projects admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
