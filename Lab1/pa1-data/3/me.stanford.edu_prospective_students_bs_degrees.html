stanford mechanical engineering stanford engineering intranet bachelors degrees an undergraduate major in mechanical engineering can lead to one of three degrees bachelor of science mechanical engineering the undergraduate program in mechanical engineering at stanford exposes each student to intellectual and practical experiences and provides an environment that allows for the accumulation of knowledge to a variety of societal needs graduates have many options from entry level work as mechanical engineers to graduate studies in either an engineering discipline or in another field where a broad engineering background is useful regardless of the ultimate career choice graduates leave the with a solid grounding in the principals and practice of mechanical engineering equipped to embark upon a lifetime of learning while employing new concepts technologies and methodologies bachelor of science product design stanford's joint program in design dates from 1958 when it was started by professor robert mckim the program is jointly offered by the mechanical engineering department and the department of art and art history over the years it has graduated hundreds of undergraduates product design concerns itself with the conception and design of product experiences for the benefit of society it encourages creativity craftsmanship and personal expression while serving larger goals of common good students studying product design generally follow the mechanical engineering curriculum and focus on a process that resolves constraints arising from technical human aesthetic and business concerns the course work provides the skills necessary to carry projects from initial concept to completion of working prototypes for more information on the design program see joint program in design and the design group web sites bachelor of science biomechanical engineering the biomechanical engineering major integrates biology and clinical medicine with engineering mechanics and design research and teaching in the biomechanical engineering group are primarily focused on neuromuscular musculoskeletal cardiovascular biomechanics and cell and tissue mechanics research in other areas such as hearing vision ocean and plant biomechanics biomaterials biosensors and imaging informatics are also conducted in collaboration with associated faculty in medicine biology and engineering this degree introduces fundamental biological and biophysical principals while developing strengths in traditional engineering areas specifically mechanical engineering primarily geared toward the students interests this major offers a plethora of courses for students interested in specific fields of biology and mechanical engineering such as design biomechanics and medicine the biomechanical engineering major provides a fundamental understanding of mechanics in fields of biology and medicine however it is not normally recommended as a terminal degree this major is well suited for those interested in future graduate studies in bioengineering medicine or related areas the course of study allows students to satisfy many premedical pre dental or pre paramedical fields for more information on the biomechanical engineering program see http www stanford edu group biomech related topics joint program in design design group institute of design center for design research biomechanical engineering click to play click to play robot cockroaches the center for design research's sprawl robots program is one of the few laboratories that designs and manufactures robots that are biomimetic mimicking biology and hexapedal having six legs the program led by mechanical engineering professor mark cutkosky is attempting to capture the essence of what insects do in a simple mechanical structure so far the engineers have succeeded in imitating the intelligence of a roach's legs it takes a mere seven lines of computer code to instruct a robot to run read full story stanford home engineering home me home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni prospective students undergraduate students applying bachelors degrees financial support graduate students applying doctor of philosophy financial support masters of science careers in me meet our students themes that define us groups & programs faculty & research admissions giving to me contact us visiting us
