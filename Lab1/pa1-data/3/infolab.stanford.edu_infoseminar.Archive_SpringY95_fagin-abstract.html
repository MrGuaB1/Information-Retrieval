fagin abstract combining fuzzy information from multiple systems ron fagin ibm almaden research center abstract in a traditional database system the result of a query is a set of values those values that satisfy the query in a system with queries based on image content the result of a query is a sorted list for example the query might ask for objects that are a particular shade of red and the result of the query would be a sorted list of objects in the database sorted by how well the color of the object matches that given in the query a multimedia system must somehow synthesize both types of queries in a consistent manner in this talk we discuss the solution adopted by garlic a multimedia information system being developed at the ibm almaden research center this solution is based on graded or fuzzy sets issues of query optimization in a multimedia system are very different from those in a traditional database system this is because the multimedia system receives answers to subqueries from various subsystems which can be accessed only in limited ways as a first step in dealing with these fascinating new issues an optimal algorithm for evaluating an important class of garlic queries is presented this talk will be completely self contained
