tests of variances until now we have confined ourselves to hypothesis testing of means both z and t testing involved the usage of distributions which possessed similar traits the symmetrical shape and the central point equivalent to zero however when testing variance and standard deviation one requires a strikingly different distribution the chi square distribution properties of the chi square distribution the graph is assymetrical skewed to the right all values are nonnegative tests of the variance requires us to assume that the population has normally distributed values as you might expect the relevant statistics s 2 and 2 are present in the chi square equation 4 19
