report number cs tr 97 1597 institution stanford university department of computer science title the earth mover's distance lower bounds and invariance under translation author cohen scott author guibas leonidas date november 1997 abstract the earth mover's distance emd between two finite distributions of weight is proportional to the minimum amount of work required to transform one distribution into the other current content based retrieval work in the stanford vision laboratory uses the emd as a common framework for measuring image similarity with respect to color texture and shape content in this report we present some fast to compute lower bounds on the emd which may allow a system to avoid exact more expensive emd computations during query processing the effectiveness of the lower bounds is tested in a color based retrieval system in addition to the lower bound work we also show how to compute the emd under translation in this problem the points in one distribution are free to translate and the goal is to find a translation that minimizes the emd to the other distribution ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 97 1597 cs tr 97 1597 pdf
