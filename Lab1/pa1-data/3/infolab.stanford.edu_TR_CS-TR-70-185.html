report number cs tr 70 185 institution stanford university department of computer science title graph program simulation author nelson edward c date october 1970 abstract this reports the simulation of a parallel processing system based on a directed graph representation of parallel computations the graph representation is based on the model developed by duane adams in which programs are written as directed graphs whose nodes represent operations and whose edges represent data flow the first part of the report describes a simulator which interprets these graph programs the second part describes the use of the simulator in a hypothetical environment which has an unlimited number of processors and an unlimited amount of memory three programs a trapezoidal quadrature a sort and a matrix multiplication were used to study the effect of varying the relative speed of primitive operations on computation time with problem size the system was able to achieve a high degree of parallelism for example the simulator multiplied two n by n matrices in a simulated time proportional to n ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports cs tr 70 185 cs tr 70 185 pdf
