report number csl tr 76 119 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title a simulator for the evaluation of digital system reliability author thompson peter alan date august 1977 abstract this report describes a simulation package designed to evaluate the reliability of digital systems the simulator can be used to model many different types of systems at varying levels of detail the user is given much freedom to use the elements of the model in the way best suited to simulating the operation of a system in the presence of faults the simulation package then generates random faults in the model and uses a monte carlo analysis to obtain curves of reliability three examples are given of simulations of digital systems which have redundancy the difference between this type of simulation and other simulation techniques is discussed ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 76 119 csl tr 76 119 pdf
