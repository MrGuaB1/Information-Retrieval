stanford engineering joel h ferziger in memory of joel ferziger joel h ferziger professor of mechanical engineering passed away in august 2004 following a courageous battle with pancreatic cancer joel was an internationally renowned researcher in fluid mechanics a widely recognized teacher and a close friend to many of his colleagues here at stanford his presence is sorely missed by his family friends students and colleagues through a generous gift from joel's family the mechanical engineering department has established the professor joel h ferziger memorial fellowship to be awarded to an incoming graduate student each year we are actively soliciting contributions to build this endowment further and we welcome your participation to make a gift online with a credit card gift go to https goddard stanford edu givingtostanford index html during step 1 select school of engineering during step 2 please further designate this is a memorial gift for the professor joel h ferziger memorial fellowship fund to make a gift by check make check payable to stanford university please add in the memo portion of the check and in a short cover letter that your gift is intended for stanford engineering the professor joel h ferziger memorial fellowship fund and mail it to stanford university gift processing office of development frances c arrillaga alumni center 326 galvez street stanford ca 94305 6105 contact information frank scioscia associate director of major gifts 650 724 7703 frank scioscia stanford edu professor phone 650 723 3615 fax 650 723 4548 email ferziger stanford edu degrees bs the cooper union chemical engineering 1957 ms university of michigan nuclear engineering 1959 ph d university of michigan nuclear engineering 1962 awards and honors national science foundation fellow 1957 1960 fulbright fellow the netherlands 1967 1968 visiting professor queen mary college london 1979 alexander von humboldt award 1987 max planck research prize 1991 research interests computation and modeling of turbulent flows kinetic theory of gases combustion joel ferziger does simulations of turbulent flows and calls himself a numerical experimentalist to do simulations it is also necessary to develop new numerical methods and for large eddy simulations sub grid scale models are needed he is also interested in modeling turbulent combustion he has investigated the effect of turbulence on a flame surface models for turbulent combustion and flame extinction and heat transfer near a wall students professor ferziger's students past and present recent publications m peric and jh ferziger computational methods for fluid dynamics springer 1996 g bruneaux t poinsot and jh ferziger premixed flame wall interaction in a turbulent channel flow budget for the flame surface density evolution equation modelling j fluid mech 349 191 219 1997 w rodi jh ferziger m breuer and m pourquie status of large eddy simulation results of a workshop j fluids engineering transactions of the asme 119 248 262 1997 hong g im thomas s lund and joel h ferziger large eddy simulation of turbulent front propagation with dynamic subgrid models phys fluids 9 2 3826 3833 1997 da briggs jh ferziger jr koseff & sg monismith turbulent mixing in a shear free stably stratified two layer fluid j fluid mechs 354 175 208 1998 mixing and available potential energy in stratified flows simulation of coastal upwelling i linear stability and the early turbulent regime simulation of coastal upwelling ii effects of coastal geometry and turbulent mixing projects asci comments or questions about this site please email the webmaster
