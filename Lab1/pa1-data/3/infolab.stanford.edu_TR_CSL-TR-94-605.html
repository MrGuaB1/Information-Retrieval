report number csl tr 94 605 institution stanford university computer systems laboratory title performance and area analysis of processor configurations with scaling of technology author fu steve author flynn michael j date march 1994 abstract the increasing density of transistors on integrated circuits and the increasing sensitivity toward costs have stimulated interest in developing techniques for relating transistor count to performance this paper maps different processor configuration to transistor level area models and proposes an optimum evolution path of processor design as minimum feature size of technology is scaled a parameter for measuring incremental performance improvement with respect to increasing transistor count is proposed ftp reports stanford edu pub cstr reports csl tr 94 605 csl tr 94 605 pdf
