sulinux home page home documentation faq installation update mail archives about sulinux note on pubsw a note to redhat sulinux users from itss linux users and administrators please be aware that pubsw software is not supported on red hat 9 including the most current versions of sulinux much of it may work but much of it definitely does not work particularly but not limited to any software built against x libraries and we do not yet have an estimated date for when we will be able to support red hat 9 unfortunately the lack of backward compatibility and the degree of change in red hat 9 is considerably worse than we had originally anticipated we had originally thought that the only change we had to worry about was patching and rebuilding old packages with errno or resolver library problems for which red hat 9 also has a workaround we have since discovered that the glibc changes in red hat 9 have also broken the pubsw x libraries as well as various other shared libraries on which pubsw software relies there is not one simple cause for the breakage red hat appears to have made multiple changes to glibc that are not backward compatible with programs built with earlier versions these problems seem to be red hat specific other linux distributions may not be affected even if using the same version of glibc debian testing and unstable for example continue to run pubsw software without difficulties there is as yet no estimated time for red hat 9 support the amount of work that needs to be done to support red hat 9 is fairly extensive in some cases requires patching the original software not just rebuilding it and may require building a separate software tree solely for red hat 9 no resources have as yet been assigned to this work in the meantime users of red hat 9 who need pubsw software will need to look for alternatives many packages in pubsw are also available as rpms that can be installed locally red hat 7.3 or red hat 8 continue to work correctly with all pubsw software or one could switch to a different linux distribution with better backward compatibility questions about sulinux read docs faq first should be addressed to helpremovemefirst linux stanford edu note delete removemefirst before sending email site last modified sat feb 18 18 43 00 pdt 2006
