constant jacobian elements constant jacobian elements if all constraint gradients jacobian elements are know derivative level 2 or 3 any constant elements may be given to snopt in the array a if desired the jacobian array gcon are initialized from the appropriate elements of a if any are constant and have the correct value funcon need not reassign them in gcon note that constant nonzero elements do affect fcon thus if j ij is assigned correctly in a and is constant a linear term gcon i j x j or gcon l x j must be added to fcon i depending on whether gcon is a two or one dimensional array remember if derivative level 2 unassigned elements of gcon are not treated as constant they are estimated by finite differences at significant expense
