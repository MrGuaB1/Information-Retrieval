stats 200 stats 200 back to main page comments deals with basic estimation and hypothesis testing i found it very helpful it's quite challenging my impression is that it's more challenging than most of the other 200 level stats classes it's taught at a fairly brisk pace with some proofs and mostly just very thorough i would recommend it to anyone who wants a more theoretical understanding of estimation and hypothesis testing it's pretty mathematical though the examples definitely aren t polisci relevant for the most part stephen jessee covers techniques for statistical estimation maximum likelihood method of moments some specific estimators statistical inference and hypothesis testing assumes knowledge of probability at the level of stats 116 lecture course with weekly homework a midterm and a final a good course for getting the background needed to read statistical articles and begin to be able to create your own estimators for unique problems if you want to take more courses to get a stronger background in methods but don t have a specific topical interest this is a great place to start christina maimone
