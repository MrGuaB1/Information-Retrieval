hall thruster simulations sppl home sppl research projects hall thruster simulations radial axial hybrid simulations related papers hybrid simulations in the radial axial plane of an annular hall thruster based on the model developed by jm fife mit 1998 are used to study the interior and near field region of a hall thruster plasma in the past these simulations have been used to examine various phenomena such as channel wall erosion background pressure charge exchange collisions heavy particle wall interactions and neutral particle injection also measurements of the electron mobility in a laboratory hall thruster have permitted the study of electron cross field transport through comparison of simulated discharge properties using experimentally measured bohm type and classical mobilities presently active areas of interest include the study of axial resistive instabilities the use of novel propellants such as bismuth and nitrogen and the implementation of a time varying calculated electron mobility using an empirical shear based approach axial azimuthal fluid simulations related papers a high fidelity hall thruster simulation has been formulated in the axial azimuthal coordinate plane this numerical model incorporates the dynamic continuum equations for the both the electrons and ions and includes the often neglected contributions of electron momentum and unsteady electron flow the coordinate system selected for this simulation as well as the inclusion of non linear electron momentum terms allows this model to self consistently evolve fundamental plasma oscillations in the electron and ion fields and predict non linear wave coupling behavior the goal of this research is to understand the connection between plasma oscillations and the enhanced electron mobility observed in the hall thruster simulation of electron behavior in near field region related papers axial azimuthal hybrid simulations related papers
