the merit function the merit function after a qp subproblem has been solved new estimates of the np solution are computed using a linesearch on the augmented lagrangian merit function where d is a diagonal matrix of penalty parameters if x k s k p k denotes the current solution estimate and k k k denotes the optimal qp solution the linesearch determines a step a k 0 a k 1 such that the new point gives a sufficient decrease in the merit function when necessary the penalties in d are increased by the minimum norm perturbation that ensures descent for m 10 as in npsol s n is adjusted to minimize the merit function as a function of s prior to the solution of the qp subproblem for more details see 7 and 3
