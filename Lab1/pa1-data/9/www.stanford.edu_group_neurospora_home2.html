perkins lab home page the perkins lab neurospora genetics and biology department of biological sciences stanford university background research in the perkins laboratory concerns genetics and biology of the filamentous fungus neurospora with studies ranging from genome organization and cytogenetics to natural populations and species recognition our current work supported by nsf continues a nearly unbroken line of neurospora research that began at stanford in 1941 with the classic experiments of george beadle and edward tatum their use of neurospora biochemical mutants opened the field of microbial genetics led to the unification of genetics and biochemistry and earned them the nobel prize in 1958 the neurospora work inspired initiation of genetic studies in e coli and saccharomyces in the 1940s and neurospora continues today as the model organism of choice for filamentous fungi more in memoriam home history projects people publications photos links contacts back to top department home university home contact us 2004 david d perkins
