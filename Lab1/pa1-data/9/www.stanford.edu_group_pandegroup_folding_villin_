villin home download faq help education news stats science results papers press awards about simulations of the villin headpiece the villin headpiece is a small 36 residue alpha helical protein it has been heavily studied experimentally and by simulation since is perhaps one of the smallest fastest folding proteins it has a hydrophobic core made of 3 phenylalanines but also has two groups a tryptophan and another phenylalanine which are hydrophobic but are solvent exposed for functional reasons duan and kollman simulated 1 microsecond of md time in a ground breaking simulation however since the folding time is on the order of 10 microseconds it is not surprising that they did not see it fold our simulations contain hundred of microseconds of md time and we have seen 35 simulations which have folded below we detail the trajectory of one of these simulations mpeg movies we have several different sizes of movies to accomodate different user bandwidths please choose a size 200x200 1 mb 400x400 3.4 mb 300x300 2 mb 640x480 4.8 mb more detailed view from individual frames frames from a villin folding trajectory you can click on a picture about to get a zoomed view c 2000 2002 vijay pande and stanford university
