oxidation in a controlled humidity environment home oxidation in a controlled humidity environment importance of humidity in local oxidation processes field enhanced oxidation of silicon or anodization of metals is highly dependent on environmental conditions humidity is of particular importance since the availability of water in the air or adsorbed onto surfaces will directly affect the rate of oxidation we are exploring the effect of humidity control on local oxidation with scanning probes we suspect that operating in a high humidity environment will allow higher speed oxidation we are also investigating the effects of operating in a stable humidity environment and whether this affects oxidation repeatability humidity control apparatus we are using a bubbler fed with compressed air to adjust the humidity inside a commercial afm chamber a humidity sensor is placed inside the chamber near the tip the compressed air pressure is adjusted to maintain a constant relative humidity inside the chamber which can be varied from about 30 relative humidity up to almost 90 relative humidity and can be held fixed to within 0.5 here is a picture showing the setup for humidity control in the afm chamber oxidation of single crystal silicon parallel oxidation lithography home micromachining imaging lithography biosensors other work questions comments mail quatewebmaster
