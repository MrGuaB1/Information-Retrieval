retroviral generation of stable cell lines page 1 gozani lab 7 2005 retroviral generation of stable cell lines i generate retrovirus day 1 1 transfect 293t cells 40 60 confluent with 3 plasmids 9 g of retroviral plasmid eg pbabe ing2 4.5 g of gag pol plasmid and 4.5 g of vsv plasmid using transit293 transfection reagent day 2 2 optional the next day change the medium but only replace 4 5 ml dmem 10 fcs to keep virus concentrated the medium change is required to remove a growth inhibitory factor produced by 293 cells upon transfection 3 2 days after tranfection collect the supernatant medium with a 10 ml syringe and add 4 5 ml fresh dmed day 3 4 filter the medium through 0.45m filter 5 aliquote 2 ml each and freeze 80oc or use fresh 6 the next day harvest the virus as day 3 day 4 ii transduction 1 plate of ht1080 cells should be around 40 50 confluent mmlv based retrovirus cannot enter non dividing cells day 3 2 for a 10 cm dish remove media and add 6 ml of new medium containing 64 g polybrene 16 l of stock solution 4 mg ml at 20oc 3 thaw the virus in the medium at 37oc quickly and add 2ml into each plate final polybrene conc is 8 g ml 4 after 4 6 hrs add 4 more mls media 5 after 24 hrs change media and split if necessary day 4 iii stable line selection 1 24 hrs after the first media change 2 days after transduction start selection with proper drugs 2 g ml puromycin 1 to 1000 dilution from 2 mg ml stock for ht1080 may vary for different cell types 1 split cells if necessary cells need to be dividing for puro to be active 2 puro can be added 24 hrs or 48 hrs after transduction 3 1 mock tranfected plate can be used to ensure that the puro did its job day 5 day 6 8 2 change media every 1 2 days split cells when necessary 3 in 2 3 days all non transduced cells should have been killed and you have your stable population of cells
