stanford university nmr facility calibrate 90o 13 c pulse 13 c or 15 n pulses should also be calibrated however these pulse are less dependent upon sample than the 1 h so previous calibrations should be close since 13 c or 15 n is being pulsed on the 2nd 3rd channel direct detect calibrations should not be used thus the best way is to calibrate the pulse is to look for maximum signal in the hmqc or hsqc the parameter of the high power 90o pulse on 13 c in experiments is normally pwc or pwx pwn for 15 n check you parameter set to confirm this as there in not a standard convention on x nuclei 90o pulse parameter names the power of that pulse is not dpwr it is usually pwclvl or pwxlvl again there is no convention on parameter names except dpwr refers to the power of decoupling low power dpwr2 low power 15 n to measure 13 c high power 90 array the pwc or whatever the high power pulse is called in that experiment at high power level pwclvl 60 again dpwr is not the right parameter and should never be 49 this time look for maximum signal this is the best pwc to use nmr facility home stanford university department of chemistry stanford university all rights reserved stanford ca 94305 650 723 2300
