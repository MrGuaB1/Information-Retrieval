research spin gap compounds research spin gap compounds an interesting class of magnetic materials is those for which the spectrum of magnetic excitations is characterized by a separation of the first excited state from the ground state by a significant amount of energy the spin gap compounds that are composed of weakly interacting magnetic dimers fall in to this class of material the spin gap can be closed by applying a large magnetic field and several exotic magnetic states have been proposed for such compounds in this regime including a bec of delocalized triplets we are currently investigating several different families of complex oxides that are based on weakly coupled magnetic dimers with the aims of better understanding the magnetic excitations and high field states of such materials the figure shows the low field susceptibility of one of these materials sr2cu bo3 2 the red line is a fit to a model of isolated dimers from which the intradimer exchange constant can be estimated high field measurements are used to reveal the effects of weak interdimer coupling the inset shows a piece chipped from a larger single crystal grown via tsfz publications most recent pressure dependent diffraction and spectroscopy of a dimerized antiferromagnet persistence of magnons in a site diluted dimerized frustrated antiferromagnet heat capacity of the site diluted spin dimer system ba 3 mn 1 x v x 2 o 8 nonuniversal magnetization at the bec critical field application to the spin dimer compound ba 3 mn 2 o 8 anisotropic phase diagram of the frustrated spin dimer compound ba 3 mn 2 o 8 click for additional publications asymmetric quintuplet condensation in the frustrated s 1 spin dimer compound ba 3 mn 2 o 8 ordered magnetic phases of the frustrated spin dimer compound ba 3 mn 2 o 8 singlet triplet dispersion reveals additional frustration in the triangular lattice dimer compound ba 3 mn 2 o 8 dispersive magnetic excitations in the s 1 antiferromagnet ba 3 mn 2 o 8 nuclear magnetic resonance evidence for a strong modulation of the bose einstein condensate in bacusi2o6 geometric frustration and dimensional reduction at a quantum critical point multiple magnon modes and consequences for the bose einstein condensed phase in bacusi2o6 bose einstein condensation in bacusi2o6 role of anisotropy in the spin dimer compound bacusi2o6 dimensional reduction at a quantum critical point low temperature structural phase transition and incommensurate lattice modulation in the spin gap compound bacusi2o6 characteristic bec scaling close to qcp in bacusi2o6 high field behavior of the spin gap compound sr2cu bo3 2 contacts eric samulon ian fisher back to home page home fisher research group geballe laboratory for advanced materials dept of applied physics stanford university ca 94305 4045 last updated dec 31st 2011 tumblr stats
