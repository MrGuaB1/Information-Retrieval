the nonlinear les nles method a fundamental paradigm shift in turbulence modeling page 1 the nonlinear les nles method a fundamental paradigm shift in turbulence modeling gregory c burton lawrence livermore national laboratory livermore ca 94550 usa burton29 llnl gov llnl abs 401873 the talk will discuss the fundamental shift in turbulence modeling paradigm represented by the nonlinear les nles method the method represents a return to first principles in turbulence simulation in that the artificial viscosity paradigm used by most turbulence models of the past half century is replaced by direct solution of the nonlinear terms in the original filtered navier stokes and advection diffusion equations by solving ui uj and uj  in their original forms as nonlinear advective stresses rather than linear viscous stresses the nles method more closely re produces the advective mechanism governing most momentum and energy exchange in real high reynolds number hydrodynamic turbulence the talk will also outline the adaptive backscatter limiter that is used in the nles approach to control numerical errors arising during an actual sim ulation finally the talk will highlight two profound consequences of this paradigm shift first the nles method is the only method that can reproduce almost exactly the local structure of mo mentum and energy transfer between the resolved and subgrid scales with correlations exceeding  0.99 making the method particularly suited to combustion models that are parameterized by local values of the total scalar dissipation and or total scalar variance second the nles method has demonstrated the first ever capability of simulating high schmidt number turbulent mixing providing in the process the first les confirmation of k 1 scaling in scalar power spectra origi nally predicted by gk batchelor nearly 50 years ago figure 1 first ever large eddy simulation of high schmidt number turbulent mixing at red 2000 and sc 1024 using the nles method showing scalar field cross section
