untitled document human astrovirus serotypes 1 8 a colorized electron micrograph of astrovirus time line by the 1980s five human astrovirus serotypes were identified by immunofluorescence neutralization and immunosorbent enzyme immunoassay in 1989 serotype 6 was identified between 1991 and 1992 serotype 7 was identified an eighth serotype has been recently recognized presently there are a total of eight known serotypes other facts immunofluorescence tests and enzyme immunoassays have demonstrated the serotype specificity of antiserum derived from animals immunized with human serotypes 1 7 a monoclonal antibody produced by herrmann et al has served as a capture antibody in enzyme immunoassays in numerous seroepidemiologic studies this monoclonal antibody targets a viral structural protein and recognizes all 7 human serotypes serotypes detected in different geographic areas in general serotype 1 appears to be the most prevalent strain but serotype 4 has been associated with severe gastroenteritis in young adults serotype 1 appears to be the prevalent strain in the uk it is most common in europe the us australia and japan in europe serotype 3 is second or third most common serotypes 3 and 4 are increasing in importance in the uk serotype 2 appears to be prevalent in mexico and type 1 appears to be relatively rare in japan food borne outbreaks of serotype 6 have affected thousands of children and adults in the us human serotypes 1 5 have been detected
