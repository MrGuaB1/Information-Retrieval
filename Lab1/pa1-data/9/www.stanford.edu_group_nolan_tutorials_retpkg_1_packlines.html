introduction to packaging cell lines stanford university medical center dept of molecular pharmacology dept of microbiology & immunology nolan lab 1 packaging lines currently the most efficient gene transfer methodologies harness the capacity of engineered viruses such as retroviruses to bypass natural cellular barriers to exogenous nucleic acid uptake we have chosen to use retroviruses for several reasons first their derivation is easy second unlike adenovirus mediated gene delivery expression from retroviruses is long term as adenoviruses do not integrate adeno associated viruses have limited space for genes and regulatory units as well as there being some contro versy as to their ability to integrate 21 thus retroviruses offer the best current compromise in terms of long term expression 10 genomic flexibility and stable integration among other features the main advantage being of course for retroviruses is that their integration into the host genome allows for their stable transmission through cell division this ensures that in cell types which undergo multiple inde pendent maturation steps such as hematopoietic cell progression the retrovirus construct will remain resident and continue to express 10 11 related links home page interests members mta forms plasmid maps retroviral systems genetic screens library systems protocols tutorials publications contact virus chat
