microdocs diversity productivity diversity disturbance resilience home elements of sustainability diversity diversity diversity affects the amount of resources we can use sustainably because it influences ecosystem health resilience and productivity taking too much from an ecosystem decreases diversity and sustainability what is diversity diversity or biodiversity is the variation within and between living things it is measured on many levels from genetic variation to differences between individuals within populations to differences among species and among ecosystems why preserve diversity ecosystems supply us with resources we need like food and water building materials medicine cultural benefits and income however the global level of diversity has fallen by 27 over the last 35 years this means that we are losing resources because of the strong effect that diversity has on productivity maintaining ecosystem sustainability is the only way we can guarantee a continued supply of resources diversity is important to sustainability in 3 main ways diversity affects ecosystem productivity diverse ecosystems generally use resources more efficiently different species use resources in many different ways one species might use a resource that would be wasted by another species and vice versa this means intact ecosystems are usually more productive than ones that have lost diversity diversity increases ecosystem resilience diversity affects an ecosystem's ability to resist disturbance like fire storms etc different types of disturbance impact organisms in different ways also some species cannot live in disturbed areas where other species thrive diverse ecosystems are more resilient and have a better chance to recover after disturbance diversity maintains ecosystem health many interactions between species and their environment maintain ecosystem health these interactions called ecosystem services help to keep an ecosystem running sustainably and include recycling and storage of nutrients maintaining water purity stabilizing climate protection from weather hazards at present technology is unable to replicate most of these services but ecosystem services are free if the diversity of an ecosystem is maintained conclusion diversity is a key element of sustainability due to its effect on productivity resilience and preserving quality of life preventing diversity loss is crucial in preserving a sustainable ecosystem references brosi bj et al 2007 cultural erosion and biodiversity canoe making knowledge in pohnpei micronesia conservation biology 21 3 875 879 pdf retrieved 29 may 2008 from http www blackwell synergy com doi pdf 10.1111 j 1523 1739.2007 00654 x chapin fs et al 2000 consequences of changing biodiversity nature 405 234 242 hector a & bagchi r 2007 12 july biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality nature 448 188 190 retrieved 26 june 2008 from http www nature com nature journal v448 n7150 full nature05947 html lovejoy t 1996 may 15 biodiversity what is it in biodiversity ii reaka kudla wilson and wilson eds joseph henry press washington dc patrick r 1996 may 5 biodiversity why is it important biodiversity ii pdf file retrieved 1 may 2008 from http www nap edu readingroom books biodiversity part1 html pfeiffer w & mcclafferty b 2007 december 18 harvestplus breeding crops for better nutrition crop science society of america retrieved 1 may 2008 from http crop scijournals org cgi content full 47 supplement_3 s 88 wikipedia 2002 march 20 biodiversity wikipedia retrieved 1 may 2008 from http en wikipedia org wiki biodiversity wwf 2008 may 16 biodiversity plummets as resource use soars world wildlife fund retrieved 30 may 2008 from http www wwf org uk search_results cfm unewsid 633 all content property of microdocs project last updated september 12 2011
