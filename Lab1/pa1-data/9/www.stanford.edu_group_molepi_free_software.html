stanford center for tuberculosis research free software f ree software periodically i will be distributing software we and our collaborators have been developing hugh salamon may 1999 the stanford center for tuberculosis research probebrowser is useful for presentation and analysis of hybridization microarray experimental results we have found it particularly useful for our genomic dna data it should prove useful with rna hybridization data for expression profiling as well version 1.7 0 is available with supplementary data for the may 28th report in science on bcg vaccine genomics probebrowser version 1.7 0 for windows 95 nt may be downloaded for free stanford center for tuberculosis research molecular fingerprint analyzer j is software which extends sctr mfa utilties providing fingerprint analysis project management fully automated clustering genetic distance and nearest genetic distance calculations queries and plotting this package permits fragment length fingerprint data from different typing labs to be compared by exploiting an analysis of error in replicate typing data from each laboratory this is work in progress but we welcome a few testers at this stage mfa j is written in java and uses native c libraries for some calculations mfa j version 2.0 for windows 95 nt may be obtained from here if there is significant interest in using this software on other platforms we will be interested in providing the software for other operating systems please note mfa j is not a gel image analysis program it imports fragment length estimates exported from gel image analysis programs questions about the use of this software should be directed to melvin javonillo melvin molepi stanford edu questions regarding development of fingerprint comparison algorithms and software should be directed to hugh salamon now at hugh abasci com stanford center for tuberculosis research molecular fingerprint analyzer sctr mfa version 0.4 3 sctr mfa runs an error analysis program on replicate strain fingerprint data which in turn recommends a method to compare lanes and calculates parameter values to use with comparison methods sctr mfa also includes programs to compare fragment length data using one of two methods align and count or interpolated error calculate genetic distances and create lists of clustered fingerprints a number of rules are provided sctr mfa is extensible to include third party or user developed comparison methods genetic distance calculators and clustering rule programs sctr mfa does not present data visually eg with lane maps nor does it perform cluster refinement the following reference describes the align and count method introduces the clustering approach used by the software and describes cluster refinement salamon h segal mr ponce de leon a small pm 1998 error analysis in comparison and clustering of molecular fingerprints emerging infectious diseases 4 2 159 168 online version available at http www cdc gov ncidod eid vol4no2 salamon htm please register and download sctr mfa if you would like to test this software for windows 95 nt if you would like the command line programs which perform all the analyses for unix operating systems please email me here is the documentation distributed with sctr mfa version 0.4 1 you may also obtain software for analysis of sets of aligned sequence data here mincov implements the unique combinations method defining combinations of variants unique to a sequence with respect to a set of aligned sequences personnel research summary bibliography announcements institutions guestbook commercial tblinks free software home these pages were designed by hugh salamon copyright 1998 last updated february 8 2001
