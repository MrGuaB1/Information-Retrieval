celiac peptide delivery contact info useful links publications people professor khosla research interests home several gluten derived peptides have been identified as being both resistant toward gastrointestinal proteolysis and immunotoxic in celiac sprue but it is not known how these peptides are crossing the intestinal epithelium intact to elicit an immune response from the underlying lymphoid tissue to investigate this question we are using two complementary approaches first we are modeling the intestinal epithelium in vitro using epithelial cells cultured in monolayers on transwells to identify those molecular factors controlling epithelial permeability toward macromolecules second we are investigating various animal models of gluten sensitivity with the goal of interrogating intestinal permeability toward gluten peptides in vivo both mass spectrometry and immunologically based techniques are being developed to detect and quantify gluten peptides in complex biological samples we hope that a better understanding of gluten peptide transepithelial delivery will enable the identification of novel therapeutic targets for celiac sprue in the near future
