david s schneider lab stanford microbiology and immunology david s schneider lab stanford microbiology and immunology we study infectious diseases and look at both the physiological mechanisms that make us ill as well as those that help us recover we want to improve the way a host clears the infection as well as endures the symptoms of the infection our largest effort so far has been to separate the process of clearing microbes which we call resistance from the illness caused by infecting pathogens tolerance our future work is shifting towards the study of recovery from infections our lab uses a variety of infection models for hosts we rely upon fruit flies and mice for pathogens we use plasmodium chabaudi which provides us with a mouse model for malaria we also study a variety of bacterial pathogens that can infect fruit flies burkholderia francisella listeria salmonella staphylococcus and streptococcus species why do we get sick when we get infections
