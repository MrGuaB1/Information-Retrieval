electrical mechanical and optical studies of nanotubes with known chirality page 1 graphene nems resonators in the quantum hall regime james hone columbia university department of mechanical engineering jh2228 columbia edu with its combination of outstanding electrical and mechanical properties graphene is an excellent candidate for nano electromechanical devices and our group is working on many aspects of fabrication readout and applications of graphene nems in this talk i will briefly review these topics and focus on our studies of graphene nems in the quantum hall regime in this regime the mechanical motion is strongly coupled to the electronic state of the system such that we observe strong oscillatory frequency shifts of up to 1 mhz this response is over two orders of magnitude larger than the expected response in a standard torque magnetometry framework we find that the frequency shifts can be used to directly read out the chemical potential and compressibility of the system modeling of the effect produces excellent agreement with experiment using only the disorder as a free parameter we further use this novel mechanism to quantify the many body exchange interaction of broken symmetry qh states this new mechanism may prove to be a useful tool for magnetic studies across low dimensional materials and in sensing applications
