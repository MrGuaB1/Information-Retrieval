pmosfet fabrication process home 100 nm pmosfet fabrication process details of the fabrication process are shown in the figure below the pmosfets were fabricated using a five mask process incorporating mix and match lithography the gate level was patterned with a scanning probe while all other lithography levels were patterned with conventional photolithography locos isolation was performed followed by an arsenic channel implant the gate oxide thickness was 5.7 nm and the polysilicon thickness was 100 nm before gate patterning the polysilicon was implanted with bf2 followed by a rapid thermal anneal rta to electrically activate the dopants the polysilicon must be conductive for hybrid afm stm lithography to create the gate pad 50 nm of low temperature oxide lto was deposited and patterned by photolithography after gate lithography a 35 nm oxide spacer was formed by lto deposition and anisotropic rie shallow source drain junctions were created by bf2 implantation the final processing steps were lto passivation rta furnace anneal contact photolithography metallization and a forming gas anneal pmosfet fabrication gate lithography home micromachining imaging lithography biosensors other work questions comments mail quatewebmaster
