brunet lab molecular mechanisms of longevity and age related diseases role of the pro longevity foxo transcription factors in cognitive function cognitive function in particular memory declines during aging this cognitive decline may not only be due to the depletion of the nsc pool but also to defects in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity intriguingly the most recently discovered foxo isoform in mammals foxo6 is enriched in adult hippocampal neurons in a region critical for learning and memory however the role of this brain specific foxo isoform in the adult organism had never been tested we have recently made a crucial step in understanding the importance of foxo6 in learning and memory in vivo by generating mice with a deletion in the foxo6 gene we found that foxo6 is necessary for the retrieval of memories but dispensable for learning using a genome wide approach we identified the gene expression program regulated by foxo6 in the hippocampus before and after learning the foxo family of transcription factors was previously known for its role in longevity tumor suppression and adult stem cells our study identifies a new role for the brain enriched foxo transcription factor in memory and synaptic function which has pivotal implications for the connection between aging and cognitive function specific projects regulation of the foxo transcription factor network importance of pro longevity genes in aging neural stem cells role of foxo transcription factors in cognitive function mechanisms underlying longevity by dietary restriction in c elegans role of the energy sensor ampk unbiased screen to identify novel ampk substrates in mammalian cells epigenetic regulation of aging in c elegans development of the african killifish n furzeri as a genetic model to identify the genetic architecture of vertebrate aging
