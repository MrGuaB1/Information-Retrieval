roughgarden lab roughgarden lab department of biology school of humanities and sciences research issues and topics my lab has focussed in recent years on the evolution of social behavior particularly in aspects pertaining to reproduction such as family dynamics and courtship we have pioneered in introducing techniques from cooperative game theory for understanding how teamwork develops and in introducing techniques from the economic theory of the firm for understanding how a family is organized for my retirement in april 2011 i have moved to hawai i and will be continuing that research here i may be developing this web site for my laboratory to support virtual lab meetings to further the social selection project these virtual lab meetings will be open to students and colleagues worldwide who wish to further the aims of the project please contact me at joan roughgarden stanford edu if you are interested one of the two defining characteristics of the social selection project is to understand social behavior by beginning with offspring production and working back from there in the life cycle to the mating period in contrast the classic sexual selection approach begins with mating and works forward in the life cycle offspring if they are explicitly considered at all are viewed as occurring sometime after the critical mating stage instead the social selection perspective views mating as promoting offspring production not so much through the transfer of sperm as through the building of social bonds that enable successful offspring rearing the sperm transfer aspect of mating is often over emphasized relative to the other functions of mating in this vein courtship can be thought of as a job interview to establish work responsibilities rather than as a platform for potential mates to exhibit their so called good genes whose existence is dubious anyway the second defining feature of the social selection project is to model social behavior as a two tier process with the dynamics of learning and development at the lower tier and the dynamics of ordinary individual natural selection at the higher tier this framing of the theory allows solution concepts such as the nash bargaining solution to be used in the behavioral tier in addition to the more familiar nash competitive equilbrium the behavioral tier can feature animals working as teams whose members show some mutual regard rather than solely as individuals whose self regard is their only motivation for a list of the publications from my laboratory please see my cv website which is found here thanks for your interest joan updated aug 5 2011
