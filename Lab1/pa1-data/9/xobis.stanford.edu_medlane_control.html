the medlane project control return to xobis main page xobis root element and general organization the xobis root element is recordlist it was chosen to permit processing of both single records and record sets it consists of one or more record elements each record consists of three required components first controldata contains metadata concerning the record itself information such as date created and maintained record type and its status history is included within controldata's three container elements id types and actions this should not be confused with marc's fixed fields secondly principal elements is a variable representing any one of 10 defined essential categories of information content generally recorded by archives libraries museums and organizations performing similar roles in order to provide bibliographic informational access and authority control to a wide variety of resources regardless of format thirdly the relationships element accommodates links between any pair of the principal elements this single element replaces three different features of marc 1 linking entries associating different bibliographic records 76x 78x 2 implicit relationships existing between traditional access points and the work represented by a record 65x 7xx etc and 3 see related entries found in authority records 5xx thus the tripartite record element is central to the fundamental structure of xobis shown in figure 1 figure 1 xobis fundamental structure this basic arrangement provides a consistent framework unifying all principal elements into a simple infrastructure while delineating fundamental differences in the data characteristics necessary to support envisioned functionality
