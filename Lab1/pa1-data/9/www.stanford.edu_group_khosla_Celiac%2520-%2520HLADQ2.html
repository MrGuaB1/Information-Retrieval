celiac hladq2 because 90 95 of celiac sprue patients express the class ii major histocompatibility complex mhc protein hla dq2 which readily binds to deamidated gluten peptides and presents them to mucosal cd4 t cells one potential strategy to curtail the t cell mediated inflammatory response typically found in the small intestines of celiac sprue patients is to block gluten peptide presentation by hla dq2 to this end our lab has designed and synthesized hla dq2 blocker peptides meant to compete with gluten epitopes for hla dq2 occupancy without causing a t cell response the design of these blockers is based upon a variant of a highly inflammatory 33 residue gluten peptide in which the amino acid side chains of residues typically recognized by the t cell receptor are modified with bulky functional groups to sterically disrupt t cell receptor affinity without affecting hla dq2 binding affinity xia 2006 13 siegel 2007 5 marti 2005 25 contact info useful links publications people professor khosla research interests home xia j siegel m bergseng e sollid lm khosla c inhibition of hla dq2 mediated antigen presentation by analogues of a high affinity 33 residue peptide from alpha2 gliadin j am chem soc 2006 128 6 1859 67 siegel m xia j khosla c structure based design of alpha amido aldehyde containing gluten peptide analogues as modulators of hla dq2 and transglutaminase 2 bioorg med chem 2007 15 18 6253 61 xia j bergseng e fleckenstein b siegel m kim cy khosla c sollid lm cyclic and dimeric gluten peptide analogues inhibiting dq2 mediated antigen presentation in celiac disease bioorg med chem 2007 15 20 6565 73
