multiuser diversity in wireless networks multiuser diversity in wireless networks professor david tse eecs university of california berkeley a central feature of mobile wireless networks is the random fading of the channel strengths of the underlying communication links channel fading has traditionally been viewed as a form of unreliability that has to be compensated for in this talk we argue a different point of view that channel fading is a form of randomization that can be taken advantage of in the design of wireless networks this viewpoint is particularly relevant in a network with multiple users each having independent fading channels we first motivate this notion of multiuser diversity from information theoretic considerations we then discuss how this concept is used in the design of a downlink packet scheduling algorithm for qualcomm's hdr wireless data system finally we show how the idea of multiuser diversity can be used to greatly increase the throughput of mobile ad hoc networks for delay tolerant applications last modified sun apr 8 23 08 40 pdt 2001
