on the developement of numerical algorithms a personal voyage page 1 on the developement of numerical algorithms a personal voyage gene golub feburary 8 2007 abstract for over 40 years i have been actively involved in developing numerical algorithms the methods developed came about through the need of solving problems which often came from applications interestingly enough each method often led to the need of others in this talk i will describe how these algorithms were developed sequentially here are some algorithms methods i shall describe 1 cyclic reduction 2 fast poisson solvers 3 domain decomposition 4 generalized cg 5 bidiagonalization of matrices 6 singular value decomposition there are others and i will welcome questions 1
