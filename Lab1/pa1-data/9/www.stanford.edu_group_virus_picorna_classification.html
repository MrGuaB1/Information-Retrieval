classification and taxonomy classification and taxonomy picorna viridae is divided into five different genera aphtovirus cardiovirus enterovirus hepatovirus and rhinovirus for more information see the tulane university picorna virus page three of them enterovirus rhinovirus and hepatovirus include human pathogens see associated viruses and diseases for a list of human viruses and diseases associated with each genus genome ssrna infectious positive sense linear nonsegmented poly a tail protein covalently linked at 5 end vpg morphology icosahedral naked 32 capsomers made up of four polypeptides vp1 vp2 vp3 and vp4 12 pentons with five copies of vp1 each 20 hexons consisting of vp2 and vp3 vp4 underneath surface of the capsid face 7.5 8.5 kb 25 30 nm in diameter the smallest rna virus appears smooth and round under electron microscopy replication replication takes place in the cytoplasm the positive sense single stranded rna functions as mrna and therefore does not require transcriptase in the virion following adsorption penetration and uncoating vpg is removed by enzymes and the mrna is translated into a polyprotein it is then cleaved into p1 p2 and p3 which act as intermediates they are further cleaved to eventually form structural and nonstructural proteins as well as an rna dependent rna polymerase vp4 vp2 vp3 vp1 2a 2b 2c 3a vpg 3c and 3d synthesis of the complementary strand uses the vpg protein as a primer and is initiated at the 3 end this strand acts as a template for the virion rna see diagram below 1996 courtesy of dr alan cann university of leicester return to picorna virus page
