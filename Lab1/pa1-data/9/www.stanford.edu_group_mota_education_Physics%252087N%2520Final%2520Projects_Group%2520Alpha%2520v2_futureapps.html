future applications future applications a promising idea for future applications of dpn is creating parallel arrays the simplest form of this is a passive probe array in this procedure the probe tips are all brought into contact with the surface simultaneously allowing for the duplication of a pattern multiple times research has been done by ibm and at stanford speculating about the kinds of products that this parallel array patterning can be applied to ibm is looking into using dpn for high intensity data storage through thermal data transfer at stanford imaging and lithographic applications are being explored using current induced lithography further expanding upon the idea of using parallel arrays the next useful development is being able to independently control each probe tip by heating up a multilayered cantilever the probe will bend this provides for the possibility of creating complex arrays at a high speed since the interaction of each tip with the surface can be independently controlled to completely integrate dpn into micro electromechanical system mems technology it is essential that automated tip coating and ink delivery be created researchers believe that the currently developing technology of microfluidic 1 systems will be able to assist in this area they see custom microfluidic systems as the future solution for controlling the inking of individual cantilevers in a parallel probe array new microfluidic inkwell arrays into which the probe tips can be dipped necessary for this endeavor are currently being developed additionally mems engineers are also looking at the possibility of integrating microfluidics directly into the tips of the dpn probes so that a supply of ink can be constantly fed to the tip much like a conventional fountain pen 1 microfluidics is the study of fluids at extremely small volumes thousands of times smaller than a droplet this field also includes the design of systems in which these small volumes will be used
