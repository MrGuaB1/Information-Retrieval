axelrod lab home home research people publications contact info welcome to the axelrod lab the axelrod lab is studying developmental patterning events at the level of morphogenesis using a combination of genetic molecular cell biological and mathematical approaches we wish to understand how genes orchestrate the elaborate choreography of development to reproducibly give rise to morphological patterns seen in multicellular organisms we use the fruitfly drosophila melanogaster and the mouse as model systems in these investigations our primary focus is on planar cell polarity pcp a signaling mechanism that orients cells within tissues and organs our studies aim to understand the mechanisms responsible for providing interpreting and executing orientation signals furthermore these signals are important not only in development but also are of central importance to a variety of developmental defects and disease states including neural tube closure defects congenital deafness polycystic kidneys ciliary dyskinesia and cancer in which pcp mechanisms are mis regulated please contact jeff axelrod if you are interested in opportunities
