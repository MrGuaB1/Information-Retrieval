faq cannot reach intranet web server faq cannot reach intranet web server from no slac network 12 may 2003 slac windows home question cannot reach slac intranet servers eg slac protected web servers requiring windows authentication such as www internal slac stanford edu from a non slac network if an offsite user or one on slac's visitor network is having problems using internet explorer to connect to a protected directory on a windows web server the solution is to select internet options from the tools menu click the advanced tab scroll down to the security section uncheck the box enable integrated windows authentication requires restart restart the computer otherwise ie tries to negotiate an authentication with the windows domain controllers on the ldap port and fails since it is blocked connecting via vpn would also solve this but would require further setup owner desktop admin www admin feedback desktop admin
