polyketides type 1 in a modular pks such as the 6 deoxyerythronolide b synthase sets of catalytic domains are organized into modules the catalytic domains from a given module cooperate to synthesize polyketides via a thiotemplate mechanism similar to that of fatty acid synthesis the nascent polyketide intermediates are then passed down to the next module in the protein assembly line organized into three polypeptides debs1 3 debs consists of six catalytic modules each containing a unique set of covalently linked catalytic domains together the six modules of this megasynthase approximated 2mda produce 6 deoxyerythronolide b 6 deb the polyketide portion of the antibiotic erythromycin 1 khosla c tang y chen ay schnarr na cane de structure and mechanism of the 6 deoxyerythronolide b synthase annu rev biochem 2007 76 195 221 contact info useful links publications people professor khosla home modular organization of 6 deoxyerythronolide b synthase debs from saccharopolyspora erythraea
