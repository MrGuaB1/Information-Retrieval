bornavirus replication bornavirus replication entry bornavirus enters the host cell via endocytosis entry of an enveloped virus into animal cells usually requires membrane fusing activity of viral surface glycoproteins bdv's glycoproteins are gp 84 and gp 43 since gp 43 is present at the surface of bdv infected cells it is probably responsible for triggering fusion events gp 84 is postulated to be involved in the attachment of to the cell surface receptor whereas gp 43 is involved in the ph dependent fusion after internalization of the virion by endocytosis after internalization the virus is delivered to endosomes genomic map of borna virus illustrating early replication and transcription taken from http jvi asm org cgi content full 72 1 783 f1 viral replication only known animal human rna virus with a nonsegmented genome of negative polarity which replicates in the nucleus of host cell in situ hybridization of infected rat brain showed that positive and negative stranded rnas were differentially located within the nucleus sense strand rna was preferentially localized to nucleolar regions while genomic sensed rnas were found in both nuclolar and nonnucleolar regions suggesting a role for the nucleolus in bdv replication it is also known that bdv's rna has an overlap of open reading frames and transcriptional units two antigens specific for borna were isolated one class corresponds to a 40 kda protein open reading frame orf p40 the other to a 24 kda protein orf p24 replication also includes posttranscriptional modification of subgenomic rnas by rna splicing specifics on replication and splicing mechanisms are still unknown
