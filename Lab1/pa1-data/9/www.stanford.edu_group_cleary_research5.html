research html mll hrx fusion proteins in leukemogenesis alterations of the mll gene also called all 1 or hrx define a subset of acute leukemias with distinctive clinical and biological features our cloning of the mll gene showed that the encoded protein shares structural similarities with drosophila trithorax which genetic studies implicate in the maintenance of hox gene expression over 20 different partner proteins are fused with mll as a result of chromosomal translocations in leukemias using retroviral mediated gene transfer we have shown that several mll fusion proteins immortalize primary myeloid progenitors in vitro cells expressing these fusion proteins cause fatal myeloid leukemias in mice our studies indicate that leukemic translocations affecting mll result in a gain of function dependent on transcriptional effector domains of the fusion partner that are critical for transformation we are investigating whether select hox genes are subordinate to mll and required for its oncogenic effects other interests also focus on the molecular mechanisms by which mll maintains hox gene expression and identification of other mll subordinate genes that contribute to leukemogenesis link to some of our publications on this topic pbx1 ko studies
