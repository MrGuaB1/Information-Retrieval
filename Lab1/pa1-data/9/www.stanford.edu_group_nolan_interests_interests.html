interests stanford university medical center dept of molecular pharmacology dept of microbiology & immunology nolan lab the laboratory focuses on signaling in the immune system and study of oncogenic process study of cancer autoimmunity and the manners in which single cells can be distinguished from normal human tissues and their biology understood thereby are prominent in our studies we use advanced flow cytometric analysis facs of phosphoproteins in single cells and dominant effector genetics to achieve many of our goals for this we have developed a range of facs assays cdna and peptide expression systems using advanced signaling analysis at the single cells level coupled to high throughput proteomics technologies and bayesian mathematics to study pathways of interest to us and derive signaling structures in normal and diseased cells proteomics multiparameter phosphoprotein analysis in single cells by flow cytometry and facs signaling systems can now be analyzed directly by flow cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting we have developed a series of methods for following multiple phosphoproteins in complex populations of primary cells up to 11 simultaneous parameters can be followed in single cells including multiple kinases phosphoproteins cell cycle and other parameters allow for exacting resolution of cellular activation states we are using these techniques to study b and t cell signaling dendritic cell function and other immune parameters by analysis of biochemical functions at the single cell level we currently have efforts in acute myelogenous leukemia adult and pediatric juvenile monomyelocytic leukemia follicular lymphoma colon cancer high throughput drug screening against kinases in complex cell populations normal stem cell development single cell kinetics and the cell cycle so called cancer stem cells use of raman spectroscopy for multiparametric cell imaging among many other projects a critical component of our work is the merging of complex biology assays with advanced computational methods for automated delineation of signaling networks see our papers in science and cell for details on the reference pages stanford university proteomics center web page related links home page interests members mta forms plasmid maps retroviral systems genetic screens library systems protocols tutorials publications contact virus chat
