splicing patterns of retroviruses stanford university medical center dept of molecular pharmacology dept of microbiology & immunology nolan lab 4 splicing pattern of different retroviruses the genome is transcribed as a full length mrna a proportion of this mrna is dedicated to translating viral proteins full length mrna can also be used as genomic rna for encapsidation although it is not clear whether the same mrna that has been translated can later be packaged post transcriptionally the mrna can be spliced to give rise to message capable of expressing envelope protein in some lentiviruses the mrna can be multiply spliced to give rise to a variety of different regulatory proteins tat rev vpu etc splicing removes sequences necessary for packaging of the genome hence only full length virus is packaged by virtue of the psi packaging signal related links home page interests members mta forms plasmid maps retroviral systems genetic screens library systems protocols tutorials publications contact virus chat
