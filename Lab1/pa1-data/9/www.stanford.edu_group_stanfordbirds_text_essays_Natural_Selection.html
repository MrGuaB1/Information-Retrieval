natural selection natural selection the characteristics of birds result from evolutionary processes the most important process being natural selection it was charles darwin who first pointed out that just as stockmen shaped their herds by selecting which animals would be allowed to breed so too nature shaped all organisms by selecting the progenitors of the next generation darwin's thinking had been influenced by the great economist thomas malthus who emphasized the capacity of people and other organisms to multiply their numbers much more rapidly than their means of subsistence darwin realized therefore that most individuals born of any species could not have survived long enough to reproduce he concluded that those that had been able to survive and reproduce had not been a random sample of those born but rather variants especially suited to their environments darwin knew nothing about genetics the work of gregor mendel remained undiscovered until early in this century almost 50 years after the publication of origin of species we now know that variation among individuals is due to both environmental and hereditary factors the latter result from the joint action of mutation changes in the genes themselves and in birds and all other sexually reproducing organisms recombination basically recombination is the reshuffling of genes that occurs during the process of sperm and egg production because of mutation and recombination each individual bird is genetically unique that is each has a unique genotype geneticists typically examine only a small portion of the genetic endowment of an individual such as the two pairs of genes out of many thousands that cause a cock's comb to be single and large or pea shaped and small thus one might speak of the single comb and pea comb genotypes in modem evolutionary genetics natural selection is defined as the differential reproduction of genotypes individuals of some genotypes have more offspring than those of others natural selection would be occurring if in a population of jungle fowl the wild progenitors of chickens single comb genotypes were more reproductively successful than pea comb genotypes note that the emphasis is not on survival as it was in herbert spencer's famous phrase survival of the fittest but on reproduction thus while selection can occur because some individuals do not survive long enough to reproduce sterile individuals also lack fitness in an evolutionary sense as do individuals unable to find mates we emphasize that fitness here refers only to the reproductive success of a kind of individual if big handsome male grouse madly displaying on a lek turn out to have fewer offspring than smaller drab males that skulk in the bushes and waylay females it is the wimpy males that are more fit natural selection provides a context in which to view the physical and behavioral characteristics of birds whether it is the large size of a female harris hawk in comparison with the male the territorial behavior of a sandpiper the bill shape of a clark's nutcracker or the coloniality of a common murre a key question to ask is how did natural selection manage that see sexual selection coevolution size and sex in raptors copyright 1988 by paul r ehrlich david s dobkin and darryl wheye
