hybrid afm stm mode lithography home noncontact afm lithography we have demonstrated that the afm operating in air may be used to pattern narrow features in resist in a noncontact lithography mode a micromachined afm cantilever with an integrated silicon probe tip acts as a source of electrons the field emission current from the tip is sensitive to the tip to sample spacing and is used as the feedback signal to control this spacing feature sizes below 30 nm have been patterned in 65 nm thick resist and transferred through reactive ion etching into the silicon substrate the same afm probe used for noncontact patterning can be used to image the sample in addition to eliminating the problem of tip wear the noncontact system is easily adapted to multiple tip arrays where each cantilever has an integrated actuator to adjust the probe height the above diagram is a schematic of the noncontact lithography system the tip sample voltage bias is kept high enough to ensure that the tip is off the surface of the resist results of noncontact lithography of sal601 resist and subsequent pattern transfer through a dry etch are shown below a top down image of 28 nm wide lines written with an exposure dose of 20 nc cm and a sample bias of 84 v b higher magnification image showing pattern continuity and uniformity c the sample was tilted to show the ends of the zig zag patterns d a higher magnification of the turn around point the feature is 32 nm wide and etched 320 nm deep into the silicon yielding a 10 1 aspect ratio high speed patterning of sog comparison of ebl and spl home micromachining imaging lithography biosensors other work questions comments mail quatewebmaster
