polyketides cross linking over the past decade there has been a growing realization of the importance of protein protein interactions domain domain domain linker etc in pks catalysis as such deconvoluting the mechanism and features of intra and inter modular communication has emerged as a critical issue in the successful protein engineering of these enzymes to this end our research aims to ascertain the structural features responsible for protein protein interaction specificity in debs utilizing x ray crystallography and chemical biology one of the key steps in pk synthesis is the decarboxylative condensation between acp tethered methyl malonyl and the growing polyketide chain tethered to the ks to circumvent the issues associated with the inherent domain mobility the acp domain specifically we have taken the approach of chemically cross linking these domains with their cognate ks partners utilizing the natural catalytic activities of these domains to obtain functionally relevant and relatively constrained adducts that are more amenable to structural studies this project is a collaborative effort with the burkart laboratory at ucsd contact info useful links publications people professor khosla research interests home figure cross linking of acp and ks at domains from debs by crystallizing the resulting complex we hope to ascertain the structural determinant of specificity for these domains
