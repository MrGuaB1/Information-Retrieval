why don t you papova and see me some time on second thought maybe i should get to know you better well do you like what you see double stranded dna virus the dna is circular supercoiled it can bind to all histones except h1 this naked virus has an icosahedral capsid with 72 capsomers a true manipulating thief it doesn t even bother to encode its own polymerase it steals its poor host's polymerase for viral replication it carries the t antigen this infamous protein can bind tumor suppressor proteins such as rb and wreck havoc on cell cycle regulation papova is a tough cookie resistant to formalin and heat inactivation you never get a second chance to make a first impression unless of course you re hpv did you know about the multiple personalities papilloma virus 8000 nucleotide powerful coding capacity capsid is about 55 nanometers in diameter hpv human papilloma virus causes warts of all sorts polyoma virus 5000 nucleotides of potential coding capacity capsid is about 40 nanometers in diameter jc and bk viruses usually goes unnoticed but occasionally will hit you with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml especially if you re immnosuppressed sv40 simian virus 40 a vacuolating virus nobody really knows what it does but everyone's trying to figure it out cancer anybody so how do you like me now
