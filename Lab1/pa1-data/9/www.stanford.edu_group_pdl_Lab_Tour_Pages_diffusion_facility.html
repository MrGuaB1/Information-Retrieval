diffusion pump facility sppl home tour sppl diffusion pump facility this experimental facility consists of a nonmagnetic stainless steel tank approximately 1 m in diameter and 1.5 m in length pumped by two 50 cm diameter diffusion pumps and backed by a 425 l s mechanical pump the facility is equipped with several viewports and feedthroughs for optical and probe access to a plasma discharge the base pressure of the facility with no gas flow is approximately 10 6 torr as measured by an ionization gauge uncorrected for gas species the background pressure during discharge operation at a xenon flow rate of 2.3 mg s is typically 10 4 torr as you can see i used to be owned by nasa but those stickers got torn off or photoshopped away the heart of this chamber is a red hot bismuth thruster but the plasma it makes is blue add some white and that spells america
