bland theta eeg activity is observed during learning especially for movement directed tasks this eeg activity is generated by synchronized synaptic oscillations and discharge activity among many thousands possibly millions of midbrain hippocampal and neocortical neurons subserving navigation motor planning and limbic system integration the sensory motor integration circuitry that drives theta eeg activity can be separated into two ascending pathways type 1 and 2 distinguished by behaviour and drug sensitivity based on different synaptic circuit and network properties associated with these two brain oscillation rhythms see bh bland for details bland bland lab maciver lab buzsaki lab lueng lab vertes lab hasselmo lab
