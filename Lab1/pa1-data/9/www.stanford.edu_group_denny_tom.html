the denny lab home overview people instruments teaching publications links tom hata phd student tom's primary research interest is in the ecological consequences of variability of flow velocities in the intertidal at sub millimeter scales this degree of resolution is necessary to accurately describe the environment experienced by planktonic organisms especially those that must eventually settle on exposed surfaces however equipment typically used to measure flow velocity in the lab settings are too delicate to place in the wave swept intertidal to this end tom is developing novel methods to measure flows in the field that are less than a millimeter above a submerged surface tom received his ba in integrative biology from uc berkeley in addition he was a visiting researcher for a year in mimi koehl's lab at berkeley before joining the denny lab
