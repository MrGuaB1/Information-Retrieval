the interaction point special features slac home research program scientific information working at slac organization phone book search spear3 breathes in response to temperature changes by matthew early wright as the sun rises each day warming the grounds and buildings of slac the entire spear3 facility expands in response the change is minuscule on the scale of a few microns far too slight to observe with the naked eye this expansion doesn t escape the watchful gaze of the spear3 feedback regulation system in fact the system responds by breathing in time with daily fluctuations in temperature spear3 team members in the control room shown back row left to right clemens wermelskirchen jeff corbett laurent nadolski soleil light source france james safranek bob hettel fernando rafael helmut wiedemann harvey rarback greg portmann shown front row left to right nadine kurita stephanie allison piero pianetta all ssrl unless otherwise noted photo by keith hodgson as the infield area and the shielding tunnel of spear3 heat up and expand radially the lattice of magnets that keeps the beam focused expands with it due to the megawatt rf system the beam stays put becoming slightly displaced in relation to the magnets in order to stay centered within the magnets the beam also has to expand in circumference an array of sensitive beam position monitors bpms keeps an eye on the displacement of the beam as they move outward they relay information to the feedback system the bpms signal that the beam is not where it's supposed to be explained jeff corbett acp the beam circumference is set by radiofrequency so the feedback system adjusts the radiofrequency to keep the beam centered in the bpms the feedback signal from the bpms cycles every six seconds while the sun is rising and spear3 is expanding the radiofrequency drops by about half a hertz per cycle then as temperatures begin to cool off in the early afternoon the radiofrequency rises again as the building contracts recent plots of the daily frequency shift confirm the pattern corbett expects to see a similar effect in response to the change in seasons over an annual time scale we suspected this was happening with spear2 but couldn t see it corbett said spear2 experienced more irregular temperature fluctuations than spear3 largely due to gaps in the thick concrete shielding this made it difficult to discern a pattern in radiofrequency fluctuations the effect is roughly proportional to the circumference of the machine corbett explained with a bigger machine a bigger shift in frequency is generally observed the lep ring at cern and the aps in chicago have even been observed to breathe in circumference due to lunar gravitational effects according to corbett spear3 recently celebrated its first year of operation relative to spear2 it is performing orders of magnitude better in terms of reproducibility stability and small spot size corbett said it has run like a champ for more information see http www ssrl slac stanford edu spear3 the stanford linear accelerator center is managed by stanford university for the us department of energy last update wednesday march 02 2005 by emily ball
