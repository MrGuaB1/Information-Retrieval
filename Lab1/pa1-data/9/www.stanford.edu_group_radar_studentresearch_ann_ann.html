howard a zebker radar remote sensing go to stanford homepage home projects people opportunities undergrads group meeting resources software links ann chen i am currently a phd student in department of geophysics i joined the stanford radar interferometry group in fall 2008 phase measurements from interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar can potentially measure centimetre scale changes in deformation over timespans of days to years at present i am using the repeat orbit interferometry package roi_pac to process insar data from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar instruments like the european remote sensing satellite ers and the advanced land observation satellite alos the l band alos data can be further used to study effects of the earth's atmosphere and ionosphere on insar data the interferograms generated from alos data show the phase changes that might be caused by the atmosphere or ionosphere with global positioning system gps data in hand i hope to measure the electron density in the ionosphere on a given day based on ionospheric delay estimation with dual frequency measurements comparing the interferograms and the electron densities of these days i am trying to distinguish between the ionosphere's effects and atmospheric effect the different colors in the figure shows the phase changes that are caused by effects of atmosphere and ionosphere these are mainly due to the atmosphere probably department of electrical engineering department of geophysics contact maps & directions
