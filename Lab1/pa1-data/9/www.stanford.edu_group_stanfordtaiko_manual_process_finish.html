stain and finish building drums with stanford taiko introduction history process thank yous staining and finishing staining the drum is an aesthetic step a darker stain will hide differences in grains and hide the glue lines however some groups prefer not to hide the origin of their drums it is a matter of group preference applying finish to the drum is a practical step finish protects the surface of the drum from moisture and dirt and will definitely extend the life of the drum on our drums a few gaps formed where the staves separated this was because we tried to force the barrel into a rounder shape by wedging 2x4's inside during the gluing process to push out the sides this made the barrel very round at the expense of some gaps on the outside an unforseen result we used a toothpick to apply a mixture of sawdust and wood glue to the cracks sand the barrel with 220 grit sandpaper and wipe it down to ensure that it is as smooth as possible apply the stain and let it dry for 1 day it is best to apply at least 3 coats of polyurethane finish apply it as thinly as possible to avoid drips and runs and to speed up the drying time let it dry 1 4 days between coats depending on temperature and humidity and sand the drum surface lightly with 220 grit sandpaper in between coats this will smooth out brushstrokes and drips the polyurethane is dried enough when it doesn t gum up the sandpaper too quickly it will be very dusty also apply polyurethane to the inside of the drum to protect the glue and wood from moisture after the last coat do not sand let the drum dry for 4 days and it will be ready to skin back drum manual written by alix koyama and dylan solomon please visit the acknowledgements page to see the many people who helped us with this project
