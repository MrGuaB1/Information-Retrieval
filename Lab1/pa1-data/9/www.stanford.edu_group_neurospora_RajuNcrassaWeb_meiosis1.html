heterothallic meiosis page 1 the perkins lab neurospora genetics and biology department of biological sciences stanford university normal meiosis and ascospore development in heterothallic species of neurospora nb raju dodge 1927 initiated studies on ascus development and mcclintock 1945 and singleton 1953 showed that meiosis and chromosome behavior in neurospora are very similar to those of higher plants and animals see raju 1980 1992 after fertilization haploid nuclei from the two parents proliferate in ascogenous hyphae these give rise to asci in which two nuclei of opposite mating type fuse to produce a diploid nucleus the diploid nucleus immediately undergoes meiosis two divisions and a postmeiotic mitosis resulting in eight haploid nuclei which are then sequestered into eight ascospores a second mitosis in the young ascospores makes them binucleate and four or five additional mitoses occur later as the black ascospores mature each perithecium produces over 200 asci the alignment of spindles at the three divisions and the linear ordering of ascospores in the elongated narrow asci make neurospora ideal for visually demonstrating the cytological basis of crossing over at the four strand stage in meiotic prophase ascus development and nuclear events are nearly identical in all eight spored species of neurospora except n pannonica raju 2000 where the immature asci are swollen and the ascospore order in mature asci may not reflect nuclear events in the ascus a nearly complete sequence of chromosome behavior in asci and ascospores is illustrated here with two diagrams and 48 photographs 38 from n crassa and 10 from n discreta figs 13 14 22 24 32 33 35 38 42 return to the photos page to view other series of photographs for permission to use these photos and copyright information click here click on thumbnails to view enlarged photos with captions previous page 1 2 3 4 next fig 1 schematic ascus diagrams fig 2 croziers young ascus fig 3 croziers young asci fig 4 pachytene hematoxylin stain fig 5 pachytene acriflavin stain fig 6 pachytene orcein stain fig 7 pachytene orcein stain fig 8 mcclintock's drawings fig 9 diplotene fig 10 diplotene acriflavin stain fig 11 diakinesis acriflavin stain fig 12 diakinesis orcein stain permission and copyright you may use any of these photos for educational purposes not for profit we ask that you use a credit line citing the original reference and the photographer high resolution versions of these photos are available upon request from nb raju's photo collection see contacts if previously published photos are to be used in publication permission will of course be required from the publisher see the captions of enlarged photos perkins lab home department home university home contact us 2004 david d perkins
