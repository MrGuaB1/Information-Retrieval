the dcdhf class of sm fluorophores dcdhfs are brighter in rigid left liquid vs frozen or more viscous right qy vs viscosity environments when the dicyano bond on the furan has a lower barrier to rotate the fluorophore is able to nonradiatively relax via a twisted intramolecular charge transfer tict state this effect can help lower background from unbound copies in solution willets callis moerner j phys chem b 2004 108 10465 10473 dcdhf environment sensitivity
