hypersonic supersonic transports propulsion system research in japan hypersonic supersonic transports propulsion system research in japan yoshiyuki fujitsu n a general manager eng dept engineering research association for s upersonic transport propulsion system abstract propulsion system researches for hypersonic supersonic t ransports have been carried out almost these 20 years in japan as for hypersonic transport propulsion so called hypr project was carried out from 1989 to 1998 10 years achievements of hypr progra m are as follows viz mach 5.5 propulsion capability was demonstrated by the following engine tests tit 1700 test of high temperature core engine was successfully completed atf test of combined cycle engine was also successfully completed to demonstrat e smooth turbo ram mode transition atf test of ram combustor engine was also successfully completed up to mach 5.5 in addition nal and isas both are now jaxa carried out air turbo ram engine so called atrex and scram engine researches as for supersonic transport propulsion system so called espr project was carried out from 1999 to 2004 5 years innovative technologies were developed through engine and rig tests to realize the following targets viz low noise 18db quieter than concorde icao chapter4 level low nox cruise nox emissions 5ei one seventh of the current technology level less fuel consumption 25 reduction after 5 years all objectives above have been achieved successfully currently feasibility study for m1 6 sst is carr ied out by jadc espr and environmentally friendly technologies for noise and nox reduction are studied in espr moreover q uite soon s3td program will start in jaxa to realize sonic boom reduction by half
