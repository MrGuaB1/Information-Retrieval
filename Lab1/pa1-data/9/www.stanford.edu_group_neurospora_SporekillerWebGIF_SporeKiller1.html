spore killer page 1 the perkins lab neurospora genetics and biology department of biological sciences stanford university the expression of spore killers in n crassa n sitophila and n intermedia nb raju turner and perkins 1979 first showed that ascospore death in certain crosses of n sitophila and n intermedia resulted from the action of an ascospore abortion factor they named spore killer sk three different spore killers are known in neurospora sk 1 in n sitophila and sk 2 and sk 3 in n intermedia sk 2 and sk 3 have since been introgressed into n crassa and n tetrasperma for genetic analysis see turner and perkins 1991 raju ad perkins 1991 as with other segregation distorters in animals and plants fungal spore killers have been found only among strains from nature turner and perkins 1979 turner 2001 when a cross is heterozygous for a killer element sk k x sk s each ascus produces four large black viable ascospores and four small hyaline inviable ascospores figs 1 3 12 13 16 19 the result is gross distortion of allele ratios for genes linked to sk on linkage group iii there is little or no ascospore death in homozygous killer x killer figs 4 5 9 10 or sensitive x sensitive fig 11 crosses in crosses heterozygous for a spore killer crossing over is blocked in a 30 map unit region that spans the centromere of lg iii in sk k x sk s where killing occurs chromosome pairing meiosis and the postmeiotic mitoses are completely normal and eight apparently normal ascospores are cut out in each ascus the four ascospores that carry sk s are arrested shortly after the first mitosis in the young ascospores and they gradually shrink and abort figs 16 19 a sensitive nucleus that would otherwise die is rescued unchanged if a killer nucleus is also included in the same ascospore raju 1979 this has been shown for a developmental giant ascospore mutant of n crassa fig 20 and for the naturally heterokaryotic ascospores of n tetrasperma and podospora anserina raju and newmeyer 1977 raju and perkins 1991 raju 1994 2002 spore killer 2 has been used to map centromere distances of mutant genes in n crassa from unordered tetrads that have been ejected from asci figs 21 22 perkins et al 1986 photographs of spore killer expression in various crosses are shown here in figs 1 22 return to the photos page to view other series of photographs for permission to use these photos and copyright information click here click on thumbnails to view enlarged photos with captions previous page 1 2 next fig 1 n sit sk1 x wt fig 2 n sit sk1 x wt fig 3 n sit sk1 x wt fig 4 n sit sk1 x sk1 fig 5 n sit sk1 x sk1 fig 6 n cra sk2 x wt fig 7 n cra sk2 x wt fig 8 n cra sk2 x wt fig 9 n cra sk2 x sk2 fig 10 n cra sk2 x sk2 fig 11 n cra wt x wt fig 12 n int sk3 x wt permission and copyright you may use any of these photos for educational purposes not for profit we ask that you use a credit line citing the original reference and the photographer high resolution versions of these photos are available upon request from nb raju's photo collection see contacts if previously published photos are to be used in publication permission will of course be required from the publisher see the captions of enlarged photos perkins lab home department home university home contact us 2004 david d perkins
