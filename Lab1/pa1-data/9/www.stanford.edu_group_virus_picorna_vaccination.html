vaccination vaccination poliovirus during the 1940's and 1950's poliomyelitis became a highly feared childhood disease especially in the united states because of its association with paralysis as a result a very strong effort was made to research the possibility of a vaccine the first effective vaccine to be developed was the salk vaccine which was introduced in 1954 known as ipv or inactivated polio vaccine it was about 80 90 effective the second vaccine opv oral polio vaccine was a live attenuated vaccine know as the sabin it is trivalent and contains strains of all three serotypes of poliomyelitis although it produces more effective immunization there have been casses of opv recipients acquiring poliomyelitis current cdc vaccination recommendations two doses of ipv at 2 and 4 months of age followed by two doses of opv at 12 18 months and 4 6 years the use of ipv is recommended to boost immunization before opv generally the more effective vaccine is used rhinovirus there is currently no vaccine for rhinovirus it is especially difficult to develop a vaccine for rhinovirus as there are over 100 serotypes there are also other viruses that are also associated with the common cold like corona virus and some enteroviruses with so many different causes the common cold has been able to baffle scientists in the search for a cure or vaccine hepatitis a the hepatitis a vaccine was licensed in 1992 it's an inactivated vaccine that is pretty expensive and is only administered to those at high risk to get fairly effective immunization that lasts for a few years two doses must be given about a month apart with a possible booster 6 months later because of the high costs and the limited duration of immunization from the vaccine general childhood vaccination probably won t be realistic until after a live attenuated or recombinant vaccine is created return to picorna virus page
