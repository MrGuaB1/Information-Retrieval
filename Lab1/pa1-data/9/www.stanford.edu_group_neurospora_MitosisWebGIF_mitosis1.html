n crassa mitosis page 1 the perkins lab neurospora genetics and biology department of biological sciences stanford university mitosis in enlarged cells of neurospora crassa nb raju neurospora nuclei in hyphae and conidia are small 2 m diameter making observations of mitosis difficult the genome is small the nuclear envelope persists cells are highly multinucleate and divisions are asynchronous these difficulties have been partially overcome by using stages when the nuclei and chromosomes are exceptionally large as in the ascus by observing synchronous mitoses in the enlarged ascogenous cells of the mutant banana and by using ethylene glycol to induce giant cells and nuclei mitotic divisions studied in these different cell types clearly resemble the prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase stages of higher eukaryotes ascus divisions the ascus is an exceptionally large cell and the four large postmeiotic nuclei show conventional division stages the second postmeiotic mitosis occurs in the young immature ascospores divisions within an ascus are synchronous following mcclintock's 1945 initial description of postmeiotic mitoses in the ascus detailed observations were made by singleton 1953 the spindles nucleolus and individual chromosomes are clearly resolved in favorable nuclei figs 1 6 raju 1980 croziers in the banana mutant the giant ascospore mutant banana makes enlarged multinucleate crozier cysts that are particularly suitable for observing mitosis raju and newmeyer 1977 in crosses of wild type x ban the first formed croziers and asci develop normally the later formed precrozier and crozier cells however do not develop into asci instead they revert to mitosis producing swollen cysts containing many nuclei all nuclei in an individual cyst divide synchronously providing replicate information for unambiguous identification of division stages figs 7 10 ethylene glycol induced giant cells when neurospora conidia are cultured in liquid medium containing 3.22 m ethylene glycol they grow without cell division forming giant spheres with multiple nuclei bates and wilson 1974 in a few giant cells nuclear numbers remain small 1 3 but the nuclei become very large figs 11 25 seven large chromosomes are seen in some nuclei suggesting polyteny and 14 or more chromosomes are seen in other large nuclei indicating polyploidy cell volume and nuclear volume are positively correlated in giant cells nuclear divisions are not synchronous within individual multinucleate giant cells spindles and spindle pole bodies which are normally conspicuous in asci are also seen in normal and reverted croziers but they have not been clearly identified in the ethylene glycol induced giant cells raju 1984 return to the photos page to view other series of photographs for permission to use these photos and copyright information click here click on thumbnails to view enlarged photos with captions previous page 1 2 next fig 1 interphase ii ascus fig 2 prometaphase iii fig 3 metaphase iii fig 4 anaphase iii fig 5 metaphase iv ascospore fig 6 telophase iv fig 7 crozier mitosis prophase fig 8 metaphase fig 9 metaphase fig 10 telophase fig 11 macroconidia fig 12 enlarged nuclei permission and copyright you may use any of these photos for educational purposes not for profit we ask that you use a credit line citing the original reference and the photographer high resolution versions of these photos are available upon request from nb raju's photo collection see contacts if previously published photos are to be used in publication permission will of course be required from the publisher see the captions of enlarged photos perkins lab home department home university home contact us 2004 david d perkins
