about us reijo pera lab research reijo pera lab home hot links hesc center protocols news & events job openings our research is focused on the genetics of human embryo and germ cell oocyte and sperm development we identified and characterized novel genes that are required for formation and or differentiation of premeiotic germ cells some of the proteins encoded by these genes such as dazl deleted in azoospermia like pumilio and nanos are homologs of germ plasm components in lower organisms that are required for germ cell formation and differentiation in males and females subsequently our analysis of these genes led us to human embryonic stem cell biology as we tracked gene function to the birth of germ cells and sought a developmental system to manipulate genes against a human genome background we explored whether human embryonic stem cells might provide a human genome based system with which to manipulate the genetics and epigenetics of human germ cell development these studies are valuable to the understanding of human reproductive failure one of the most common health problems in men and women and a common cause of birth defects in addition these studies may allow generation of novel human embryonic stem cell lines through somatic cell nuclear transfer the ability to produce germ cells in vitro would circumvent the limited availability and potentially allow production of diverse stem cells in vitro for therapeutic uses nih infomation about stem cells see current members for more details blastomere formation after somatic cell nuclear transfer scnt home about us links members publications protocols contact us feedback copyright 2007 rpl stanford university
