research negative u superconductivity research negative u superconductivity high tc has left us with a series of unanswered questions and developing model systems to address some of these issues is an important task one particular question that we are currently addressing is whether charge transfer layers play a totally passive role in achieving the highest tc values negative u interactions due to heavy ions in these layers could possibly enhance tc but the cuprates are very complex materials to investigate such an effect pbte lightly doped with tl and more recently snte doped with in provide simpler model systems to explore the possibility of pairing interactions due to the action of valence skipping elements publications most recent correlation of anomalous normal state properties with superconductivity in pb 1 xy tl x in y te microwave surface impedance measurements of tl x pb 1 x te a proposed negative u induced superconductor evidence for a charge kondo effect in pb 1 x tl x te from measurements of thermoelectric power enhanced superconducting pairing interaction in indium doped tin telluride click for additional publications type ii superconducting parameters of tl doped pbte spie conference proceedings evidence for charge kondo effect in superconducting tl doped pbte contacts ian fisher ted geballe alum yana matsushita alum ann erickson back to home page home fisher research group geballe laboratory for advanced materials dept of applied physics stanford university ca 94305 4045 last updated tumblr stats
