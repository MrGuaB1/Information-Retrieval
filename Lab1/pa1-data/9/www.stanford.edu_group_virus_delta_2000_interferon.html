interferon alpha interferon alfa interferons infs are naturally occurring glycoprotein cytokines that inhibit viral replication interferon alpha like all interferons has a variable and broad spectrum antiviral effects interferons appear to be effective at slowing the replication of almost any human virus however its clinical efficacy is decreased by the serious side effects for example while inf alpha may be effective at stopping the symptoms of the common cold this treatment is not practical since the side effects are generally more disturbing than an average cold infection the side effects include an immediate influenza like syndrome with fatigue fever chills headache anorexia myalgia arthralgia nausea vomiting diarrhea and diaphoresis prolonged therapy can lead to myelosuppression hepatitis nuerotoxicity depression ataxia tremor seizures sedation coma cardiac toxicity neurasthenia and chronic fatigue interferon alpha has been shown to be an effective treatment for the following viral infections chronic active hepatitis b infection hepatitis c infection non a non b viral hepatitis condlyomata acuminata human papilloma virus infection kaposi's sarcoma hhv 8 interferon alpha is a substance produced naturally by virally infected macrophages it induces its antiviral effect by a variety of means that include induction of mhc class i and ii macrophage activation natural killer cell activation and the activation of cd8 and cd4 t cells source page et al integrated pharmacology 1994 p 320 455 456
