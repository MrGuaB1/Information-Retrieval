a handoff algorithm using pattern recognition accurate and efficient handoff algorithms are necessary to increase the realized system capacity of cellular and personal communication systems in order to reduce the network signalling load the number of handoffs must be kept to a minimum while maintaining the quality of the radio link current handoff algorithms based on the conventional hysteresis rule present a tradeoff between the number of handoffs and the call dropping probability this tradeoff can be overcome by the use of pattern recognition in this presentation a handoff algorithm is described which is based on the recognition of patterns in received signal power the handoff algorithm uses the repeatability of the large scale signal variation with respect to a base station to predict when a handoff is necessary a pattern consists of average signal strength samples collected at the mobile station within a spatial window recognizing a sequence of patterns along a given path indicates the approximate position and direction of travel of the mobile station an outage probability criterion determines the acceptable serving base stations for each location this handoff algorithm performs fewer handoffs than a hysteresis absolute threshold method while maintaining link quality last modified tue nov 2 19 38 11 pst 1999
