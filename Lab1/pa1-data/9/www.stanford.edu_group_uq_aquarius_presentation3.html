aquarius aquarius numerical methods for uncertainty quantification and prediction of high reynolds number flows aquarius is an associate team between inria project team bacchus the uncertainty quantification laboratory and charbel farhat group in stanford university funded from 2011 to 2013 presentation of the collaboration this research project deals with uncertainty quantification and numerical simulation of high reynolds number flows it represents a challenging study demanding accurate and efficient numerical methods the first topic concerns the simulation of flows when only partial information about the physics or the simulation conditions initial conditions boundary conditions is available in particular we are interested in developing methods to be used in complex flows where the uncertainties represented as random variables can have arbitrary probability density functions the second topic focuses on the accurate and efficient simulation of high reynolds number flows two different approaches are developed one relying on the xfem technology and one on the discontinuous enrichment method dem with the coupling based on lagrange multipliers the purpose of the proposed project is twofold i to conduct a critical comparison of the approaches of the two groups stanford and inria on each topic in order to create a synergy which will lead to improving the status of our individual research efforts in these areas ii to apply improved methods to realistic problems in high reynolds number flow top menu home page presentation of the collaboration members program and results 2011 2012 publications phd thesis visits internships workshops events see also the associate team program on inria's website contact pietro marco congedo pietro congedo inria fr members area restricted access to members only inria team bacchus web site stanford team uq web site
