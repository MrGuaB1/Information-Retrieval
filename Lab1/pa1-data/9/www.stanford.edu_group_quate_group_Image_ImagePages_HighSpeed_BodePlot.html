conventional way home the plot above compares the frequency responses of the piezotube actuator and the integrated zinc oxide actuator the piezotube actuator has its first resonance around 1 khz while the zno actuator doesn t see its first resonance until about 60khz this coresponds to constant force mode tip speeds of about 100 um s for the piezo tube and 1cm s for the zno actuator the dip in the piezotube amplitude response before the mechanical resonance peak is caused by mechanical electrical coupling between the piezotube electrodes and the tube itself the conventional afm high speed images home micromachining imaging lithography biosensors other work questions comments mail quatewebmaster
