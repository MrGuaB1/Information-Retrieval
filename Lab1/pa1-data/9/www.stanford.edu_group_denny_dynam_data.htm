untitled document in order to collect wave force data that can be compared to other data and converted into water velocities it is necessary to calibrate the springs and to convert the data using equations provided by bell and denny 1994 dynamometer spring calibration though the springs are manufactured to specific tolerences it is important to verify the stretch and initial load constants for each spring pre stress the dynamometer see below before measuring the extension lengths to tighten the knots in the string to calibrate a spring hang each of five known masses from the meter containing the spring and measure the resulting extension of the spring the same way you would measure the meter in the field see field section on reading meters multiply masses by the acceleration due to gravity 9.8 m s 2 to convert to units of force n fit the force and extension measurements to a linear regression f kx c where k is the spring constant and the constant c reflects the force required to overcome the initial compression of the spring we have found that the spring constant does not seem to change significantly after spending time in the intertidal to calculate forces for the meters with small polypropylene balls divide these wave force numbers by the ratio of the area of a polypropylene ball to that of a wiffle ball note area refers to the area an approaching wave faces if the diameter of the ball is 1 then the area is  1 2 2 0.7855 data translation to use the extension measurements to calculate max water velocity u use the following equation from bell and denny 1994 u kx c a 1 b where a and b describe hydrodynamic properties of the particular ball on the dynamometer best estimates of a and b for wiffle balls from bell and denny 1994 are 0.575 and 1.93 respectively
