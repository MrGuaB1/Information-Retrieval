supplementary figure 1 centriole configuration in the cell cycle supplementary figure 1 centriole configuration in the cell cycle a diagrammatic representation of the centriole cycle showing how engaged centrioles s g2 and m phases can be distinguished from disengaged centrioles g1 phase based on the localization patterns of centrin c nap1 and pericentriolar material pcm daughter centrioles grow from mother centrioles in s phase and are initially shorter than mother centrioles and have less centrin protein c nap1 level on centrioles is reduced during mitosis indicated by the smaller red sphere b c early g1 cells released from mitotic shake off b cells arrested in s phase with aphidicolin b and centrosomes purified from unsynchronized hela cells c were stained with antibodies against indicated proteins d centrosomes purified from hela cells arrested in s phase were stained with anti centrin and anti c nap1 antibodies centriole configuration in centrosomes was determined n 200 percentage of doublets is shown in the upper left percentage of singlets in lower right scale bars 1 m m supplementary figure 2 a model for regulation of centrosome duplication the diagram shows separase dependent centriole disengagement licensing cdk2 e dependent centriole growth and centrosome separation during g2 m transition the key feature of this model is that centriole disengagement and centriole growth are distinct activities occurring at non overlapping stages of the cell cycle
