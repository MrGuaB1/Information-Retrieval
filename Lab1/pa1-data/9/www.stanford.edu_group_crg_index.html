stanford university research group on climate tectonics and landscape evolution home professor chamberlain people laboratory publications the members of the stanford university research group on climate tectonics and landscape evolution study the relationships and coupling between climate tectonics and landscape evolution at present these studies are concentrated into three broad themes 1 the relationship between topographic evolution of cenozoic mountain belts and climate here we use stable isotope records from intermontane basins to extract large scale topographic growth of mountain belts field studies include the western us cordillera the andes and the himalaya tibetan system 2 the development of numerical models for chemical weathering in active mountain belts and application of these models to field areas this research is directed toward understanding how chemical weathering tectonics and climate are linked moreover we are also applying these models to modern ecosystems to examine how uplift and weathering of rocks influences forest growth we are currently conducting this research in new zealand hawaii the cascades and the southeastern margin of tibet 3 the cenozoic climate change of western us we are constructing long term terrestrial climate records of the western us with emphasis on times when carbon dioxide was considerably higher than present these studies are directed toward how the western us has responded in the past to warmer conditions and how it might therefore respond in the future copyright 2007 climate tectonics and landscape evolution research group of leland stanford junior university all rights reserved
