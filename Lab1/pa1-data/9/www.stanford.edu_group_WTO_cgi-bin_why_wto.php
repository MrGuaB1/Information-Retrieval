work technology & organization about why wto well there are lots of reasons wto offers the only doctoral program in organizational studies in the united states located in an engineering school wto faculty have international reputations as leading researchers in the field of organization studies wto doctoral students combine studies in engineering management sociology and psychology to build a unique and balanced perspective on work technology and organizations wto doctoral students have full access to stanford's entire organization studies community which is one of the largest in the country wto welcomes applications from students with either social science or technical degrees the mixing of engineering and social science is the department's trademark wto faculty work closely with a tightly knit cohort of wto doctoral students if we are to successfully adapt to today's new technical environment we must understand how technologies affect day to day activities and perceptions at the center for work technology & organization you will learn to understand the important interactions among technology work and organizing so that some day you can potentially affect the course of these changes directly testimonials siobhan o mahony boston university graduated in 2002 advisor steve barley i came to wto because i knew that i wanted to do field research and i was interested in how technology was affecting people's lives at work or at home what i did not know was that i would be trained among the very best in the field since i have left and become a faculty member i have developed a renewed appreciation for the type of training that wto offers there are very few institutions like it doing field work is hard the rules that are written are inadequate to describe the process thus you need to learn by doing and doing so with the best is just invaluable i realize now that the degree of care and attention that the wto faculty spends with graduate students is not the norm but that it is essential to the training of a doctoral student in addition as a social scientist in an engineering school you develop a behind the scenes appreciation for engineering culture and how technologies are developed interpreted and adapted i learned far more than i realized and i miss that now top mark mortensen insead graduated in 2004 advisor pam hinds choosing to get pursue my degree within the wto was one of the best and easiest decisions i ve made when i arrived at the wto trained as a computer scientist i was completely unfamiliar with organizational theory or behavior during my time in the wto my interactions with the faculty and students were an ideal mix of intellectual rigor curiosity freedom and support the wto's intellectual vibrancy was matched only by the tireless mentoring of its world class faculty who helped me find my intellectual interests and voice with access to stanford's diversity of disciplines and scholars and immersed in the technology hub of silicon valley i couldn t have found a better intellectual environment for the study of work technology and organization top victor seidel university of oxford graduated in 2005 advisor bob sutton during my doctoral studies the stanford center for work technology and organization provided an always engaging and truly collegial environment in which to learn the craft of scholarship in these important areas indeed the center set the standard for the type of academic community i hope to foster myself in the years ahead top paul leonardi northwestern university advisors steve barley and diane bailey i came to wto with a background in communication studies and was a bit apprehensive about joining a ph d program in an engineering school i quickly discovered that i actually had a lot to say to engineers and that they were quite interested in how social science research could provide insights that could help design better technologies and better organizations just like ethnographers engineers are empiricists who want to understand how and why the world works after nearly four years working in the wto i am now confident in my ability to translate insights from social scientific research into implications for technology design implementation and use i would encourage anyone who has an interest in the study of work in technical settings to consider all they can learn from studying at wto top overview wto interests colloquia lab meetings faculty students alumni partners current projects past projects publications resources why wto admissions requirements courses copyright 2008 11 stanford university
