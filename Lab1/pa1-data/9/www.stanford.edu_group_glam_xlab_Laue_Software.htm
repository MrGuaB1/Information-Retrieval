x ray lab laue the northstar real time orientation system northstar is a menu driven program which provides real time viewing of a laue x ray diffraction pattern images can be collected for a few seconds and then displayed program also allows storage and retrieval of images the northstar program also provides analysis routines which may be used to determine the crystal orientation from a laue pattern the program can assign miller indices hkl for both cubic and non cubic systems the northstar program can take the resultant solution and generate a stereographic projection of that orientation the stereographic projection can be manipulated through various rotations to allow viewing of other orientations the display screen output can be directed to the printer
