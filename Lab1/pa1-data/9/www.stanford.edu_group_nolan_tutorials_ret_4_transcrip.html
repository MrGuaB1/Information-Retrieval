general transcription of retroviruses stanford university medical center dept of molecular pharmacology dept of microbiology & immunology nolan lab 4 general transcription and proteins encoded from spliced mrna of retroviruses transcription proceeds through the genome and mrna is polyadenylated and processed using signals in transcribed regions from the 3 ltr at the end of the transcribed r the full length message can be spliced to lead to production of envelope proteins or other proteins depending upon retroviral class unspliced full length mrna can give rise to gag pol proteins gag and pol are made as either gag protein or a gag pol precursor a viral protease cleaves the precursor into multiple subunits with varying functions the env protein is also translated as a precursor which is cleaved by endogenous proteases to yield the mature surface glycoprotein see below translated proteins assemble a retroviral particle at the cell surface full length genomic unspliced mrna containing a packaging signal termed psi is bound by gag derived proteins and incorporated into the budding particle related links home page interests members mta forms plasmid maps retroviral systems genetic screens library systems protocols tutorials publications contact virus chat
