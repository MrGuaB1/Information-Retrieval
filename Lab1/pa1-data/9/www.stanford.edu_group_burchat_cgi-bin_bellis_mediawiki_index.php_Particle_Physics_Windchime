particle physics windchime matt bellis matt bellis particle physics windchime from matt bellis jump to navigation search the particle physics windchime ppw project grew out of a first order version developed at the science hack day sf in 2010 the ppw is being developed and maintained by matt bellis and david harris ppw 3d image jpg ppw 2d image jpg join the google discussion group on this work contents 1 download 2 running 3 using the particle physics windchime 3.1 run it 3.2 change it 3.3 coming soon 4 known bugs 5 thanks download the ppw is written using the processing programming language one very nice feature is that it can create a transferable application using java for different platforms the 2d version is now deprecated no further development will be done with that version linux 3d zip mac osx 3d zip windows 3d zip running when you have downloaded the zip file uncompress it using the tool of your choice unzip stuffit this creates a directory called app_ppw_2d_ os or app_ppw_3d_ os where os is the operating system linux macosx or windows running the app is slightly different depending on your operating system os linux go into this directory and run the executable cd app_ppw_2d_linux ppw_2d mac osx go into the app_ppw_2d_macosx app_ppw_3d_macosx directory in here you should see an application actually it's directory called ppw_2d app or ppw_3d app double click on the icon name to run the program windows go into the app_ppw_2d_windows app_ppw_2d_windows directory in here you should see an executable called ppw_2d or ppw_3d double click on the icon name to run the program using the particle physics windchime run it select a file using the select a file dropdown menu at the top note that these files represent simulations of different particle physics processes press play change it try different files physics processes do they look sound different try different mappings using the mapping drop down menu at the top these are presets that take different particle physics detector properties and map them onto the sonic characteristics change the speed using the tempo slider in the lower left in the 3d version you can change the view using the mouse and the mouse buttons peasycam libraray in processing left button rotate middle button translate right button zoom coming soon the purple dropdown menus will be enabled in a future release so that you can select your own sonic mappings known bugs the purple dropdown menus don t do anything right now they re just placeholders the text is blurry on the gui in the 3d app this is a known issue related to my using the p3d renderer the problem goes away if i use the opengl renderer but with that i get some crashes it could be related to my linux java installation processing forum discussion about blurry text thanks this project makes use of the following tools the processing language some extra processing libraries soundcipher for the sound controlp5 for the gui peasycam for the camera control on the 3d version thanks to everyone who helped on this project during the science hack day sf not just our group of developers but the organizers of the event itself retrieved from http www stanford edu group burchat cgi bin bellis_mediawiki index php particle_physics_windchime views page discussion view source history personal tools log in login with webauth search this wiki navigation main page community portal current events recent changes random page help search toolbox languages toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki this page was last modified on 29 june 2011 at 10 38 this page has been accessed 9741 times privacy policy about matt bellis disclaimers
