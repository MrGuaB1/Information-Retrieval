stanford center for magnetic nanotechnology center for magnetic nanotechnology home news our mission field of study faculty and research groups nanomagnetics facility memberships industry affiliates field of study the stanford center for magnetic nanotechnology is organized on the successful foundation of the center for research on information storage materials founded in 1991 the changes in the center's name and its operation mode are motivated by the rapidly evolving landscape in the industry and the intellectual environment at stanford in particular as magnetic recording industry prospers and matures new industries are emerging most notably in spintronics biomagnetics energy and environment we envision that our center should be positioned to effect or lead new waves of magnetics related technologies before the emerging technologies blossom into mainstream industries consequently our strategic research topics include but are not limited to the following new materials and mechanisms for magnetic random access memory mram and spin transfer torque ram stt ram spin filters and spin transistors high saturation high resistivity soft magnetic materials for integrated inductors transformers and energy conversion bio magnetic interface concepts detection of magnetic nanoparticles by spin valve sensors and other spintronics sensors in vitro diagnostics of cancer cardiovascular diseases infectious diseases etc application of magnetic nanotechnology to biomedicine including genomics and proteomics cell sorting including of circulating tumor cells and stem cells spin electronics including using photoelectron emission microscopy peem for direct imaging of spin injection and investigation of spin configuration in antiferromagnets x ray circular magnetic dichroism studies of magnetic multilayers element specific magnetic moments and orientations stxm new materials for information storage at atomic or molecular level high resolution scanning magnetic probes new magnetoresistive materials and read heads including magnetic tunnel junctions half metal and high spin polarization materials current perpendicular to plane cpp gmr spin valves new materials to extend the superparamagnetic limit such as new high saturation soft magnetic materials for inductive write heads and perpendicular recording disks patterned magnetic media nanocharaterization of advanced magnetic media including high resolution tem studies of magnetic media magnetization dynamics probed with ultra short picoseconds high field pulses high data rate magnetic recording copyright stanford university all rights reserved
