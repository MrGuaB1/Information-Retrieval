the structure of the retrovirus stanford university medical center dept of molecular pharmacology dept of microbiology & immunology nolan lab 5 schematic of the retroviral structure the lipid bilayer is shown as two concentric outer circles oin which are embedded the envelope protein complex the capsid proteins are shown as a hexagon the two copies of the rna genome are shown as a loop bound by nucleoproteins other proteins are as indicated virion structure depending upon the retroviral class particle shapes can be divided into distinct categories a type particles are immature intracellular forms derived from endogenous retrovirus like elements and the immature form of mmtv b type particles correspond to the extracellular form of mmtv and are characterized by prominent surface protein spikes and a dense acentric nucleocapsid c type particles form at the surface of the cell at the site of budding lentiviruses bud like c type particles but have a distinctive blunted cone shaped core d type particles are the mmpv related viruses of sub human primates and differ from b type particles by a lack of surface spikes related links home page interests members mta forms plasmid maps retroviral systems genetic screens library systems protocols tutorials publications contact virus chat
