constraints and slack variables constraints and slack variables the upper and lower bounds on the m components of f and gx are said to define the general constraints of the problem snopt converts the general constraints to equalities by introducing a set of slack variables s where s s 1 s 2 s m t for example the linear constraint 5 2 x 1 3 x 2 is replaced by 2 x 1 3 x 2 s 1 0 together with the bounded slack 5 s 1 the problem defined by 1.1 can therefore be rewritten in the following equivalent form the linear and nonlinear general constraints become equalities of the form f x s n 0 and gx s l 0 where s l and s n are known as the linear and nonlinear slacks
