mitrophanov alexander mitrophanov washington university dynamics of post translational genetic regulation in enteric bacteria closely related organisms often express the same set of genes in response to a particular environmental signal however the regulatory mechanisms promoting the expression of these genes can be drastically different ranging from direct transcriptional control to multi stage architectures involving feedforward loops and transcriptional cascades such differences lead to distinct quantitative features of the regulatory circuits analysis of such features can provide insights into the factors contributing to the diverse lifestyles of the related species and their physiological properties such as virulence and antibiotic resistance while the quantitative features of transcriptionally regulated circuits have been extensively studied the rules governing the dynamics of genetic circuits involving post translational regulation have remained largely unexplored the focus of this talk is quantitative analysis of the genetic circuits used by enteric bacteria to regulate resistance to the antibiotic polymyxin b such circuits involve proteins belonging to the recently emerged broad class of bacterial post translational regulators termed connector proteins we employ the comparative dynamics methodology combining mathematical modeling and experiments to investigate the physiological roles of connector mediated regulation bioclub schedule
