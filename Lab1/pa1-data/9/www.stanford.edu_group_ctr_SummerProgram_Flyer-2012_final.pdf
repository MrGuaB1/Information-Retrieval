center for turbulence research summer research opportunity page 1 center for turbulence research summer research opportunity june 24 july 20 2012 http ctr stanford edu the center for turbulence research invites applications for participation in its four teenth biennial summer research program the objective of the program is to promote development and evaluation of new ideas in turbulence research it is expected that novel ideas and preliminary results generated during the summer program will be of sufficiently high caliber to lead to publications and to provide grounds for new research in the participants home institutions interested scientists may consider submitting proposals in general areas of multi physics turbulence research examples of areas currently under study at ctr are turbulent combustion in subsonic and supersonic regimes large eddy simulation les of multi phase flows including sub filter modeling of primary atomization bubble and drop formations and modeling of turbulence particulate interactions wall boundary condi tions and sub filter modeling for high reynolds number les aerodynamic noise and hydroacoustics flow control and optimization modeling of transition to turbulence boundary layers over rough or super hydrophobic surfaces cavitation radiative transfer error estimation and uncertainty quantification in numerical simulations numerical algorithms for complex flows and for emerging computer architectures and novel data mining techniques participants will have the unique opportunity to make use of the center's advanced numerical simulation technology including an unstructured code for multi phase react ing flows in complex configurations computer expertise is not essential and applica tions from experimentalists and theoreticians are encouraged scientific staff members and graduate students highly skilled in computer programming and familiar with the center's post processing systems will provide support faculty applicants may propose to have their own advanced doctoral students accompany them the available ctr databases include velocity pressure vorticity and scalar fields in several compressible and incompressible flows three dimensional fields at several instants and some time series are available for each flow several large memory multi processor linux systems including the certainty cluster with 7000 cores and 120 gpu's numerous graphics workstations and a visualization system with a large 9 tile display for 3 d data analysis will be available to the participants some participants in the recent past summer programs have used their own databases and codes although most of the summer program will be based on existing data a few new cases suggested by the participants may be carried out in preparation for the summer program approximately fifty participants will be selected on the basis of their research ideas and the overall synergistic potential of the group fellowships will provide appropriate support including travel and a stipend potential applicants unfamiliar with the ctr summer programs and the format of the program and examples of previous research performed should visit the ctr web site http ctr stanford edu the 2012 program will take place on the 25th anniversary of the founding of ctr and its first summer program in 1987 application procedure applicants should submit a brief proposal stating the fundamental questions to be addressed and or the data and the computer codes to be employed along with financial requirements include a current vita applications must be received by january 15 2012 awards will be announced on march 1 2012 housing arrangements will be made thereafter write to center for turbulence research bldg 500 stanford university stanford ca 94305 3035 ph 650 736 0766 fax 650 725 3525 turbulence stanford edu please post please post please post
