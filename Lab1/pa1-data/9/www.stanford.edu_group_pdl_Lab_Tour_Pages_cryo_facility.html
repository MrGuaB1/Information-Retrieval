cryopump chamber facility sppl home tour sppl cryopump chamber facility this test facility consists of a non magnetic stainless steel chamber approximately 1.5 m in diameter and 3.3 m in length the chamber is pumped by a pair of two stage cryogenic pumping systems cvi tm1200 the cryopumps are backed by a mechanical pump in order to enhance the efficient use of this chamber a 1.5 m gate valve has been installed to isolate the test section from the cryopumps in this way the cryopumps can remain operational with the gate valve closed while adjustments are made in the test section once any changes have been made and the chamber door closed a turbo pump is used to reduce the test section pressure the gate valve is then opened to expose the cryopumps and reduce the test section to operational pressures the pressure during typical thrust measurements is approximately 3 10 4 pa measured using an ionization gauge uncorrected for xenon i m a chamber sometimes i try to escape so i have to be chained down i am pretty big huh that's my gate valve it's super we should put a better picture of the cheng gun here
