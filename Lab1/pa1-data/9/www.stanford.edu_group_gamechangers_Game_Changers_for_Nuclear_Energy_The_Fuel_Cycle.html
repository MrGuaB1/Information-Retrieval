the fuel cycle the fuel cycle we will examine the technical aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle and consider technological innovations policy shifts and other developments that could change the planning assumptions used currently we begin naturally enough with the front end examining the current state of mining milling and enrichment we consider physical constraints on natural uranium and mining locations before moving on to discuss innovations in enrichment technology as well as possible policy developments such as the establishment of a multinational fuel bank advances in reactor technology could significantly increase the marketability safety and proliferation resistance of nuclear power in the next section we outline the outstanding prob lems in reactor design and discuss possible new technical innovations like the traveling wave reactor and more here we will also discuss the prospects and timeline for nuclear fusion with special attention to life at livermore and iter the multinational collaboration we then evaluate the current state of the back end of the fuel cycle discussing possible game changers in reprocessing and storage storage and disposal image courtesy of japan nuclear mining front end operation back end
