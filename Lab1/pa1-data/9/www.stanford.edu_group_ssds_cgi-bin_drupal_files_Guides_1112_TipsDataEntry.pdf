statistical software support page 1 2011 2012 stanford university social science data and software tips for data entry 1 come and see the ssds software consultants we recommend that you come to the ssds walk in hours before you begin entering your data so that we can advise you on the best way to enter your particular data after you have finished entering your data stop by walk in hours again and we can help you open your data in a statistical software package such as spss and begin to analyze your data 2 structure of your data file data is usually entered in a rectangular format with each row representing a case and each column representing a variable for example if you survey college students each row will be one student and each column will represent students answers to one of your survey questions we recommend that you use a spreadsheet program such as excel 3 use id numbers each case in your data file should be assigned a unique identifying number for example if you survey college students you should assign a unique number to each respondent this will be the first variable you enter for each survey 4 keep variable names short and descriptive enter variable names in the first row of your data spreadsheet many software has relaxed the 8 or less characters rule for variable names but it is still a good idea to keep them as short as possible variable names cannot start with numbers and cannot contain any symbols such as or or spaces your variable names should be descriptive so that you can recognize them eg use numfrnds for a variable describing the number of friends a student has use a separate worksheet to keep track of what each variable name means if you need 5 use numbers to represent variable values assign a numeric value to the values your variables can take for example if you have a variable for year in school use 1 for freshman 2 for sophomore and so on 6 use flags as you build your dataset flags are dummy variables which you can use while building your dataset to mark unusual observations such as outliers the flags will then make it easy for you to identify and work with these odd cases during your preliminary analysis of the data page 2 7 develop a systematic way of handling missing data you must enter a value for missing data we suggest using a value that is not likely to replicate actual values in your data for example 9 for missing and 8 for not applicable 8 keep written documentation keep detailed written documentation of your work as you enter your data this document should include information about how you have coded your data and changes you have made for example you will want to document that you coded female as 1 for females and 0 for males the software consultants at social science data and software ssds provide technical support for the stanford community users can view documents access information about our drop in hours and submit questions from our web page at http ssds stanford edu copyright 2011 by the board of trustees of the leland stanford junior university permission granted to copy for non commercial purposes provided we receive acknowledgment and a copy of the document in which our material appears no right is granted to quote from or use any material in this document for purposes of promoting any product or service social science data and software document revised 10 3 2011 ssds software services at stanford
