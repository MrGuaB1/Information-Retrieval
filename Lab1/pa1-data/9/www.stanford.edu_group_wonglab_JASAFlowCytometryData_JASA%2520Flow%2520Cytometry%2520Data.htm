jasa flow cytometry data jasa flow cytometry data the flow cytometry data used in the jasa paper were derived from the experimental data posted by sachs et al as a supplement to their science paper for our experiments there was some minimal processing done to discretize the data as well as prepare the database for use with the bnslx package nine of the total 12 datasets were used with 600 samples taken randomly from each dataset 1 cd3 cd28 2 cd3 cd28 icam2 3 cd3 cd28 aktinhib 4 cd3 cd28 g0076 5 cd3 cd28 psitect 6 cd3 cd28 u0126 7 cd3 cd28 ly 8 pma 9 b2camp each of these was log transformed and then discretized into three levels using simple 1 d k means clustering the dataset and the experiment identifiers are available here in both r and text formats the bde files contain the processed data while the all rda contains an r image of the original unprocessed data the graphs were constructed using the bnslx package here and the graphs constructed using databases built with the fill db function here and then processed with the equi energy sampler here a parallel tempering sampler is also available as the function fast order pt which is often useful for tuning of the equi energy sampler
