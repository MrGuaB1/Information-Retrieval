research quasicrystals research quasicrystals quasicrystals are well ordered materials possessing sharp diffraction patterns but lacking the translational symmetry of conventional crystals we are therefore able to explore the consequences of an ordered but non periodic structure on magnetic and electronic ground states recent advances in the growth of single quasicrystals have opened the door to making detailed measurements of the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties of these and related materials such measurements directly address outstanding questions in the field recent results have included the growth and characterization of the primitive icosahedral phase r mg cd left photograph and elucidation of the transport properties of the controversial al pd re system via measurements of single grain samples right photograph publications most recent reply to comment on extrinsic origin of the insulating behavior of polygrain icosahedral al pd re quasicrystals extrinsic origin of the insulating behavior of polygrain icosahedral al pd re quasicrystals magnetic properties of single grain r mg cd primitive icosahedral quasicrystals the electrical conductivity of single grain al pd re quasicrystals contacts suchitra sebastian ian fisher back to home page home fisher research group geballe laboratory for advanced materials dept of applied physics stanford university ca 94305 4045 last updated tumblr stats
