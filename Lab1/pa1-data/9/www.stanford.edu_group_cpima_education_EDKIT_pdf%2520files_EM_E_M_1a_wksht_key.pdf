electricity and magnetism worksheet key part 1 page 1 electricity and magnetism worksheet key part 1 name ______________________________ 1 today i used the following two items that run on electricity students draw pictures of items such as lights alarm clock toaster students draw pictures of items such as car television computer 2 label the drawing with the 3 main parts of the atom show the proper charge for each particle or 0 proton neutron 0 electron __ __ proton __0_ neutron __ _ electron 3 i lit my light bulb with the following circuit electricity and magnetism part 1 page 1 page 2 electricity and magnetism worksheet key part 1 4 draw how electrons would be moving in the wires of your light bulb circuit 5 draw how electrons would be moving if your circuit was opened 6 put a check next to the items that you think are conductors students will put checks in the leftmost column based on their intuition and current knowledge of the world the items listed will vary with whatever has been provided to them the answers below are for purposes of example here for conductors test item test results conductor test results insulator nail glass marble aluminum foil eraser pencil lead this will depend on the pencil lead used no 2 pencils are generally conductors higher numbers of pencil leads usually are insulators because a wax is used along with graphite to make these rubber band wood plastic penny led the led will conduct electricity in only one direction changing the battery connections will change the outcome of this experiment electricity and magnetism part 1 page 2 page 3 electricity and magnetism worksheet key part 1 7 draw the circuit that you will use to test for conductivity below a washer is being tested in the circuit below if the light goes on the object is a conductor if not it is an insulator electricity and magnetism part 1 page 3
