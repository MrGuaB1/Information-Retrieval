ces multiphase combustion large eddy simulation of multiphase combustion current research by olivier desjardins practical combustors also involve multiphase systems where the fuel is injected as a liquid jet that breaks up to form secondary droplets these droplets then evaporate to form the gas phase fuel that passes through the combustion zone in addition fuel rich high temperature regions can cause soot formation that leads to solid particle evolution inside a combustor such multiphase multi physics phenomena can be captured by a modular modeling approach different physical regimes of the combustor namely primary breakup secondary atomization combustion soot formation can be studied using independent target cases droplet evaporation in a temporal shear layer click image to see full size droplet evaporation in a temporal shear layer re 200 droplet position superimposed on mixture fraction contours 5 million hexane drops are simulated in this direct numerical simulation click here to see animation ignition of a cluster of heptane droplets ignition of a cluster of heptane droplets droplet position superimposed on an isosurface at t 2200k click here to see animation preferential concentration of particles in a turbulent mixing layer preferential concentration of particles in a turbulent mixing layer re 200 the stokes number for these particles is 3 vorticity contours are shown long particle beads are seen forming in regions of high strain low vorticity click here to see animation
