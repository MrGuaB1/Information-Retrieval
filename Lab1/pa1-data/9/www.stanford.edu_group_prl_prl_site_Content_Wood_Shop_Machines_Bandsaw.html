bandsaw bandsaw there are two bandsaws in the wood shop their functions are nearly identical but each bandsaw operates slightly differently so if you have any questions about the blade guard shifting gears or anything else ask the ta on duty operation cutting most things in the model shop is quite easy with the exception of particularly hard dense woods so it is possible to achieve cuts that are nearly perfectly straight or very complicated pink foam modulan wax and plastics are also cut on the bandsaws in the model shop there is only one pitch of blade used in the model shop so no blade changing is necessary due to workpiece thickness like it is in the machine shop occasionally it will be necessary to use a thinner blade than is usually found on the bandsaws so please see a ta if you think you need the blade changed safety issues fortunately since the forces required to cut materials in the model shop are considerably lower than those required in the machine shop bandsawing is less dangerous however there are still a few things to look out for to make sure your digits workpiece remain uninjured make sure you don t exceed the minimum radius of cut for the width of blade you re using in most cases if you need a very small radius you can use the jigsaw otherwise you may need to ask a ta to change the blade for you set the upper blade guide 1 8 to 1 4 above the workpiece if at all possible this will ensure maximum tension and better control over your cut keep your hands out of the path of the blade use a push stick if this is not possible reduce feed pressure at the end of your cut to prevent your fingers slipping into the blade use a vise for stability when cutting round or irregular stock if you don t use a vise the blade can catch spin your piece and slam your fingers into the bandsaw table it hurts trust me allow the blade wheel to stop completely before opening panels do not change or weld bandsaw blades yourself if you need a new blade please ask a ta to do it for you
