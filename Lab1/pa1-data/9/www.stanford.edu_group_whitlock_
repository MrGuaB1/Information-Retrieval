the whitlock lab stanford university the whitlock lab is located in the department of molecular pharmacology in the school of medicine at stanford university our research focuses on the mechanism by which the environmental contaminant 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin tcdd dioxin alters gene expression and produces its biological effects which include cancer birth defects endocrine alterations immunotoxicity and other changes tcdd is the prototype for a class of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons which appear to have a common mechanism of action and to produce similar effects although they differ in potency tcdd achieved notoriety in the 1970's when it was discovered to be a contaminant in the herbicide agent orange and was shown to produce birth defects in rodents it continues to generate concern because of its widespread distribution as an environmental contaminant its persistence within the food chain and its toxic potency tcdd can produce both adaptive beneficial and adverse effects one adaptive response is the induction of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes which catalyze the metabolic processing of lipophilic chemicals to water soluble derivatives thereby facilitating their elimination via the urine we are analyzing one such adaptive response the induction of cyp1a1 gene transcription in mouse hepatoma cells as a model for understanding the mechanism of dioxin action in experimental animals tcdd elicits numerous adverse effects raising concern about the risk it poses to public health in humans tcdd can produce the skin condition known as chloracne the possibility that it also produces cancer endocrine alterations immunological changes and or birth defects as it does in animals is the subject of debate many individuals have been exposed to tcdd primarily from dietary sources although occupational and accidental exposures have also occurred thus the population at potential risk for adverse effects is large tcdd is a poor substrate for detoxification enzymes therefore it tends to persist in the body raising the concern that repeated exposures even to low concentrations may evoke harmful health effects knowledge of the mechanism of dioxin action may help in accessing its health risks while generating new insights into the regulation of mammalian gene expression our studies are funded by grants from the national cancer institute and the national institute of environmental health sciences which are members of the national institutes of health nih dept of molecular pharmacology stanford university medical center stanford university homepage originally created by felix w frueh updated and maintained by caroline johnston updated 7 99
