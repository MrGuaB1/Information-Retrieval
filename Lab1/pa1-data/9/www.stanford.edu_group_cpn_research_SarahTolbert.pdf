semiconducting polymer based photovoltaics are a growing area of solar energy research page 1 self organized nanostructured materials for energy supercapacitors batteries and solar cells sarah h tolbert ucla department of chemistry and biochemistry and the california nanosystems institute los angeles ca 90095 tolbert chem ucla edu amphiphilic assembly provides a powerful method to optimize nanoscale architecture for applications in alternative energy for example block copolymer templating of inorganic frameworks can be used to produce periodic nanoporous materials which can find applications in high capacity batteries and pseducapacitors in the latter case we find that nanoporous materials built from nanoparticle building blocks effectively combine high surface area with efficient solvent diffusion to show fast charge and discharge times in a broad range of materials in some cases the combination of pore flexibility and short diffusion lengths also produces a phenomenon called intercalation pseudocapacitance where traditional battery like intercalation becomes kinetically facile nanoscale structure can also improve cycle life in high capacity large volume change battery reactions such as the alloying of lithium and silicon for energy harvesting we move away from inorganic materials and instead focus on semiconducting polymer based solar cells here we ask how self assembly can be used to control polymer chain conformation with a goal of optimizing both carrier mobility and overall device architecture
