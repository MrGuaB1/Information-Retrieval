hybrid afm stm mode lithography home electron beam lithography ebl and scanning probe lithography sp l a comparison lines of various spacing written with scanning probe lithography spl and etched into the underlying silicon a lines are on a 500 nm pitch b lines are on a 200 nm pitch c gid with lines spaced by 200 nm in both directions etch depth is about 300 nm linewidth for all line spacings is about 65 nm all patterns were written with the same exposure dose demonstrating the reduced proximity effects with spl as compared with electron beam lithography electron beam lithography ebl and scanning probe lithography spl are electron exposure techniques capable of high resolution patterning of organic resists we have compared the exposure properties of these two systems we have found it is possible to print sub 50 nm features in commercially available organic polymer electron beam resists using both ebl and spl spl has a widedr exposure latitude than ebl spl requires a significantly higher incident electron dose for exposure than does ebl there is a long range tail to the absorbed energy density distribution in ebl caused by backscattered electrons whose range is considerably larger than the forward scattering range in the resist film there is no evidence of backscattered electrons in spl spl can achieve superior linearity in the pixel writing scheme due to the confined distribution of absorbed energy density which allows excellent linewidth control proximity effects which hamper linewidth control in ebl are virtually eliminated in the case of spl the exposure mechanism for the low energy spl electrons may be different from that of the high energy ebl electrons noncontact afm lithography 100 nm pmosfet fabrication home micromachining imaging lithography biosensors other work questions comments mail quatewebmaster
