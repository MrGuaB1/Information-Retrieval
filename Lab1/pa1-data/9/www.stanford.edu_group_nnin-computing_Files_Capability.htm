home capabilities computational facilities hardware there are 64 duel processor nodes for a total of 512 cores the cpu is intel quad core xeon processor e5440 12m cache 2.83 ghz 1333 mhz fsb all 64 nodes are linked with gigabit network and 24 nodes are linked with infiniband each node has 16 gb of ddr2 667 ram the total storage space is ca 11tb installed application software mosaics it is written in a c++ object oriented framework for the conformational sequence sampling optimization of biophysical structures proteins nucleic acids molecular entities biopolymers can be described at different resolution from one center per monomer residue nucleotide to all atom description with solvent effects it is free of charge after registration with the developer champ it performs quantum monte carlo calculations it is free but requires agreement with developer partly due to the sophisticated nature of the method cp2k it performs atomistic and molecular simulations of solid state liquid molecular and biological systems it uses a mixed gaussian and plane waves approach gpw and classical pair and many body potential it is freely available cpmd it is particularly designed for ab initio molecular dynamics based on parallelized plane wave pseudopotential implementation of density functional theory it is freely available gamess it is one of the most popular quantum chemistry software packages and is widely used for chemistry and biology applications it includes density functional theory and other more sophisticated correlation methods including configuration interaction perturbation theory and coupled cluster theory it is freely available gaussian it is one of the earliest and most popular quantum chemistry software packages it is commercial and stanford like many other institutions has a site license it is the software package that a large percentage of users both theoretical and experimental in chemistry are first introduced to nwchem it is a comprehensive software package that includes most of the functionality typically used in chemistry biology and material sciences it is designed for massively parallel computers and is highly scalable it is freely available vasp it is one of the standard simulation tools based on pseudopotential and plane wave basis set for solid state physics it is licensed software and a few groups at stanford may have license to it atk vnl it is designed for electronic transport calculations based on dft and local basis set it is commercial installed compilers and system libraries fortran and c c++ compilers mkl and ftt libraries from intel mpich2 compilers and libraries with socket and shared memory implementation installed visualization software molden and ecce these can be used to visualize and build structures plot wavefunction and charge densities visualize molecular orbitals and visualize vibrational movements ecce also has extensive structure database for typical structures and structure fragments frequently used in chemistry and biology these are free we provide expertise collaborations and consulting services in the following high performance computing issues atomistic nanoelectronics simulations including ab initio negf transport simulations atomistic simulations related to energy sciences hydrogen storage photovoltaic nuclear energy and heterogonous and homogeneous catalysis expertise in both plane wave and local basis set based dft methods and wavefunction based methods such as configuration interaction ci coupled cluster cc many body perturbation mp and quantum monte carlo qmc ab initio and force field based molecular dynamics simulation atomistic simulation of biological systems we also plan to support visualization packages the new capability will be based on user demands
