power saving for monitors and cpu's power saving for monitors and cpu's 08 february 2005 slac nt home eudora faq actions you can take to save energy at the end of each day when you leave power off the monitor normally please do not power off your cpu since we need this on in order to push out timely security patches to the computer if you need to power off your computer for windows do not press the workstation power off button unless you have first used the shut down command and you receive a message that says it is now safe to shut down your computer if you turn off the power before shutting down you risk losing data also please check with your local administrators that your department does not have processes running that needs your computer up during the weekend eg some departments run backup over the weekend for unix if you don t have privilege to shut down your unix workstation see your department administrator or send mail to unix admin to request it for a computer system the monitor uses up about 1 3 of the power and the cpu users up about 2 3 since different models of monitors may have or have not abilities to go into power saving mode the simplest instructions is to power off the monitor this is a recommended practice to power off your computer now and then to clean up computing processes which may be left over system administration tasks configuration checking scanning anti virus activities are often performed during normal weekday evenings therefore users do not normally have to turn off their cpu's during the weekdays for windows there are about 1700 pc's at the lab running windows and linux the majority are dell systems though perhaps about 10 might be clones and other models which do not follow the model below these numbers are based on dell cpu configured as follows 1 single pentium p3 processor 2 single hard drive and cdrom optiplex gx1 68.2 w operational 4.5 w off gx110 56.8 w 4.0 w gx300 76.8 w 4.4 w gx200 55.3 w 2.2 w precision 420 122.2 w max 78.6 w min 3.6 w off precision 620 174.9 w 160.8 w 3.6 w the examples below are dell monitors most commonly used at slac nearly all the dell monitors onsite have a form of power management the power management system works only when used with vesa dpms compliant pc's and or graphics controllers example dell m1110 monitor power saving mode video hsync vsync power on normal use active yes yes 130w typical stand by blanked no yes 15w suspend blanked yes no 15w active off blanked no no 5w on some of the older monitors such as a d1025ht 17 or the d2026t hs which are all sony trinitron monitors standby mode runs about 100w so the power saving in standby mode is not so great on some of the viewsonic monitors such as the p780 the power used in standby mode goes back down to 15w again so it would appear that different manufacturers of monitors use different schemes active off on most monitors resetting the on off switch is how you get out of it if a monitor has both vertical and horizontal sync off it is pretty much turned off such as in this case it will still have an led slowly flashing on the panel of the display the exact location of the settings and names of the buttons and tabs may vary depending on which model and whether the user is running nt4 or win2k but basically it is this settings control panel display icon screen saver tab power button in energy saving features frame turn monitor off select time feedback
