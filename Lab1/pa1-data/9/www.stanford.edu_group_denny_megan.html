the denny lab home overview people instruments teaching publications links megan jensen phd student megan is a second year student in the lab studying the hydrodynamic forces imparted to organisms living on rocky shores breaking waves impose severe hydrodynamic forces on intertidal plants and animals playing a major role in shaping the ecology of wave swept rocky shores however the largest wave imposed forces are poorly understood it has long been assumed that lift drag and buoyancy dominate the intertidal environment however a less well known force the impingement force may actually be larger impingement is characterized by a sharp transient force imposed on emersed objects within 0.05 seconds of a wave's arrival and preliminary data indicate that it is the greatest hydrodynamic force exerted on intertidal plants and animals using the lab's gravity driven water cannon megan is studying the causes of impingement forces and the effects on the rocky shoreline near hopkins prior to joining the denny lab megan earned her bse at the university of michigan in naval architecture and marine engineering after two years in corporate america she decided to turn to marine biology in hopes of pursuing a research career in marine biomimetics
