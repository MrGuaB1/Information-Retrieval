coaxial plasma thrusters sppl home sppl research projects coaxial plasma thrusters several sources have reported a second mode of operation in gas fed pulsed plasma thrusters gf ppts this mode is accessible at high specific energies and accelerates the propellant through a thick stationary discharge region rather than through a dense moving current sheet snowplow this so called plasma deflagration mode provides significantly higher thrust efficiency and specific impulse accompanied by reduced electrode erosion analytical research focuses on developing a model that describes this second mode the theoretical work is supported by experiments on our 3 kj coaxial high energy cheng thruster results show similarities to detonations and deflagrations in combustion science and inspired a model that is based on an analogy to the rankine hugoniot theory from combustion theory the combustion theory is extended to hydromagnetics and has shown good agreement with second mode data in addition it also offers new insight to the snowplow mode suggesting that it behaves more like a plasma detonation than an impermeable sheet related papers
