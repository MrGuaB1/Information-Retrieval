lens manual saveweights saveweights saves the link weights and other values in a file usage saveweights file name values num values text nofrozen onlyfrozen description this writes the weights for every link in the network into a special file the file can be later reloaded into a network of the same architecture if the file name has the extension gz bz bz2 or z it will automatically be compressed it is customary to give weight files the extension wt when training networks with momentum deltabardelta or other sophisticated algorithms it is usually important to save more information for each link than just its weight if num values is 2 both the weights and the deltas used by momentum will be saved a value of 3 will save the weights deltas and last values which are used by deltabardelta in alens if a num values of 3 is specified in standard lens only the weights and deltas will be written as there are no lastvalue fields therefore you can use 3 to store all of the link values in either version of lens the default is to write a binary weight file if the text flag is given values will be written in text format ordinarily all links in the network will be saved if nofrozen is specified frozen links will not be saved if onlyfrozen is specified thawed links will not be saved these are useful if you only wish to save part of the network when using networks with randomized structures it is important to record the random seed used when building the network so the same architecture can be reconstructed later otherwise weight files saved with this command may be useless later examples to save the weights in the compressed binary file greatnet wt gz lens saveweights greatnet wt gz to save all of the link values of non frozen weights in text format lens saveweights foo wt gz v 3 n t see also loadweights seed
