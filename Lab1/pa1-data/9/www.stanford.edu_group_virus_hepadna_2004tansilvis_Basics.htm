virus family basics virus family basics hepadnaviruses are characterized by envelope spherical 42nm in diameter contains cellular lipids glycoproteins and a virus specific surface antigens such as hbsag icosahedral capsid 27nm core the core contains contains an antigen hbcag dna polymerase and a small circular partially double stranded dna capsid is closely surrounded by the viral envelope t 3 triangulation number viral genome circular 3.2 kb partially double stranded dna containing four overlapping open reading frames it has the smallest genome of dna viruses one dna strand the minus strand has a protein covalently attached to the 5 end the plus strand is of variable length and is shorter than the negative strand and has an rna oligonucleotide at its 5 end picture courtesy of http www stanford edu group virus hepadna index html strand is outer strand shorter strand is on inside dr1 and dr2 are repeated elements other blacks boxes refer to promoters enhancers dashed line refers to the variable length of the strand protein products include p protein reverse transcriptase polymerase protein prec and c aka hbcag core proteins pres1 pres2 and s aka hbsag surface proteins x a transcriptional activator that might be of importance in hbv associated cancer that is only present in mammalian hepadnaviruses the rest of discussion will be based on hepatitis b virus hbv as more is known about this virus than other viruses in the hepadnavirus family back next
