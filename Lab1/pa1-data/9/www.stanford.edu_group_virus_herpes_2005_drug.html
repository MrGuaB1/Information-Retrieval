drug profile of vistide basic info new findings viral profiles drug profile pathogen cards links structure of vistide drug cidofovir vistide cidofovir is a nucleotide analog marketed under the name vistide and is used to delay the progression of cmv retinitis by suppressing cmv replication the drug inhibits cmv dna polymerase by incorporating itself into the growing viral dna chain thus inhibiting viral dna synthesis cidofovir is taken in two stages induction therapy stabilizes present damage and maintenance therapy which keeps the infection under control the drug is given intravenously and induction therapy is given once a week for two weeks and maintenance therapy is every other week though the drug is able to inhibit viral polymerase at concentrations 8 600 times lower than necessary for inhibition of human polymerase by far the most serious side effect of the drug is irreversible kidney damage to prevent this saline is administered before the drug and probenecid pills are taken the day of the treatment however lab tests which monitor kidney function must be performed on a regular basis other less serious side effects include nausea and vomiting fever weakness rash headache diarrhea hair loss and shortness of breath though resistance to cidofovir has yet to be documented it is hypothesized that as the virus changes its structure cidofovir could potentially lose its effectiveness very few studies have been done so far but studies have shown potential cross resistance between other drugs used to combat cmv viruses resistant to the drugs ganciclovir and foscarnet have also shown resistance to cidofovir reference http www catie ca facts nsf 0 cd1cb3b809ccde7d852566b900057499 opendocument http www gilead com pdf vistide pdf picture http www gilead com wt sec vistide
