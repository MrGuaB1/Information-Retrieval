plasmid maps stanford university medical center dept of molecular pharmacology dept of microbiology & immunology nolan lab plasmid maps and sequences listed below are data on basic plasmids that are used as backbones for many retroviral constructs in the nolan laboratory clicking on the name will open a page describing the vector with links to sequence files material transfer agreements mtas and cartoon representations of vector elements these vectors are available from addgene plasmids pbmn z this is the lab's standard retrovirus vector backbone that expresses lacz most of the other library vectors and ires constructs are based on this expression vector a variant comes with gfp in place of the lacz gene see below pbmn z in this retroviral vector expresses lacz and has an ires neo downstream pbmn i gfp the pbmn backbone with ires allowing for expression of gfp related links mtas and instructions for obtaining these vectors download the sequence of pbmn z here a more detailed map of pbmn z can be viewed here download the sequence of pbmn z ires neo here download the sequence of pbmn z ires gfp here home page interests members mta forms plasmid maps retroviral systems genetic screens library systems protocols tutorials publications contact virus chat
