flavivirus classification and taxonomy the flavivirus family consists of about 70 members 13 of which cause disease in humans most flaviviruses are group b arboviruses flavivirus was declared a separate family in 1984 before that time it was closely associated to and classified along with togavirus although flavivirus bears a superficial resemblance to togavirus its replication strategy is distinctly different from that of togavirus flavivirus shares sequence homology with certain plant viruses particularly tobacco mosaic virus flavivirus's nucleotide sequence is similar to that of the picornavirus flavivirus virions are spheroidal enveloped and 40 60 nm in diameter the surface projections of the envelope may be small surface appears rough or distinct obvious fringes in negative stains flavivirus's nucleocapsid is icosahedral and 25 30 nm in diameter the flavivirus genome is composed of linear single stranded infectious positive sense rna the genome is monopartite and 11000 nucleotides long the structural genes are located at the 5 end and the 5 terminus has a methylated nucleotide cap the 3 terminus has no poly a tract figure 1 schematic representation of the mature flavivirus virion e envelope protein m transmembrane protein c capsid protein from henchal and putnak 1990
