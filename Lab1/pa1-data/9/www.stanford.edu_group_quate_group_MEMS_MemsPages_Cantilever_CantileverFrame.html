scanning probe micromachining cantilevers home home zno cantilever for example a cantilever with a length on the scale of a hundred microns like the one above can be used for extremely sensitive measurements in a wide variety of signal domains including electrical thermal chemical and magnetic by transducing these signal domains to deflection of a cantilever picometer resolution with millisecond response time can be achieved the cantilever above includes an integrated piezoelectric actuator and a piezoresisitve sensor the fabrication process highlighted on the right starts with a bare silicon wafer which is etched to form the tip then the piezoresistor and lithography line are paterned by selective doping of the wafer the pink level above shows these implanted regions the lithography line is the doped trace that leads to the tip and allows electrons to flow through the tip in lithographic applications next the doped traces are isolated from the first metal level by oxide and nitirde films contact holes are then patterned through these isolation layers so that the electrode layer metal can reach the traces the actuator material zinc oxide is deposited on top of the metal trace and finally the top electrode in deposited introduction arrays home micromachining imaging lithography biosensors other work questions comments mail quatewebmaster
