aquarius aquarius numerical methods for uncertainty quantification and prediction of high reynolds number flows aquarius is an associate team between inria project team bacchus the uncertainty quantification laboratory and charbel farhat group in stanford university funded from 2011 to 2013 boundary layer enrichment our work is focused on advection dominated problems with small viscosity for this class of problems when no slip boundary conditions are prescribed a boundary layer may develop the problem beeing thus multiscale standard methods will fail solving it accurately an idea to overcome this difficulty is to improve the approximation space taking into account partial a priori knowledge of the boundary layer this is done inside the stabilized finite elements framework by adding new basis function in an xfem way some work has already been done by abbas et al for the linear advection diffusion equation we extend this to the non linear viscous burgers equation showing that in spite of the enrichment functions an additionnal stabilization term is still required scientists involved r abgrall s brogniez c farhat a krust a krust r abgrall continuous enrichment for advection dominated problems iciam international congress for industrial and applied mathematics 2011 vancouver canada top menu home page presentation of the collaboration members program and results 2011 2012 publications phd thesis visits internships workshops events see also the associate team program on inria's website contact pietro marco congedo pietro congedo inria fr members area restricted access to members only inria team bacchus web site stanford team uq web site
