fisher research group fisher research group welcome to the fisher group homepage our research focuses on the design growth and characterization of materials with unconventional magnetic and electronic ground states and phase transitions through this research we aim to better understand and ultimately harness emergent behavior in quantum materials our experiments emphasize probes of the thermodynamic and transport properties of solids coupled with an extensive crystal growth program the geballe laboratory for advanced materials at stanford university provides the perfect environment in which to implement this program follow the links for information about specific projects and please feel free to contact us for further information this work is supported by the department of energy office of basic energy sciences under contract de ac02 76sf00515 the airforce afosr muri and by the national science foundation division of materials research under grants dmr 0134613 and 0705087 research superconducting iron pnictides negative u superconductivity topological insulators cdw formation quantum magnetism of spin dimer compounds 5d magnetism quasicrystals publications teaching in 2011 2012 ph43 electricity & magnetism ap270 magnetism & long range order in solids people ian fisher james analytis scott riggs han oh lee jiun haw chu hsueh hui kuo paula giraldo max shapiro administrative associate alison veith alumni photo gallery other stanford sites geballe laboratory for advanced materials stanford institute for materials and energy science applied physics physics materials science & engineering stanford university ssrl fisher research group geballe laboratory for advanced materials dept of applied physics stanford university ca 94305 4045 last updated 21st feb 2012 tumblr stats
