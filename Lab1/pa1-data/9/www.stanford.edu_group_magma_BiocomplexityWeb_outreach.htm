education and outreach undergraduate and graduate education has been inextricably linked with our research explicitly so in the kohala field system where much of this research has been carried out through an archaeological field school hawai i archaeological research project this school has involved 16 graduate students and 12 undergraduates in the past three summers another 7 graduate students and 10 undergraduates from other institutions have worked in the field on aspects of the research and interactions among research groups and modules have been seamless and highly productive with students often shifting from coring a montane bog to digging soil pits to picking charcoal from trenches in a single week two doctoral dissertations at uc berkeley are based in part on research carried out through this project and 4 postdoctoral fellows have received all or part of their support from the grant we are confident that students and postdoctoral fellows have received both substantial training in the specific areas they have worked and intensive indoctrination in the benefits of interdisciplinary research about half of our students are women 5 are native hawaiian and 4 belong to other minority groups in the course of our work we have made a systematic effort to reach out to the hawaiian public and particularly to native hawaiians with our findings the extent and intensity of precontact dryland agriculture are not widely appreciated in hawai i and where they are understood the contemporaneous scarcity of agriculture as intensive in the continental tropics is little recognized our outreach has been direct through numerous public talks through the educational system through talks to native hawaiian programs at the university of hawai i manoa and hilo and at kamehameha schools a multi campus k 12 school for native hawaiians and through the media the u hawaii team also developed a 2 segment video series on archaeology and the kohala field system for 7 th grade public schools in hawaii we also contribute annually to the orientation of students in the university of hawaii hawaiian internship program for native hawaiian undergraduates our research program has received substantial media coverage in hawai i including a front page story and photograph in the local newspaper for leeward hawai i west hawaii today finally we have developed this website featuring key results of our project hale
