x ray lab laue mwl 100 real time back reflection laue camera system the multiwire mwl100 real time back reflection laue camera system mwl100 camera system is designed to replace the conventional back reflection laue film method the mwl100 camera system is more efficient than film in detecting x rays and provides a fast economical method of characterizing and orienting crystals by dynamically viewing the back reflection images on an computer screen in real time using northstar program the system has following properties consists of a position sensitive x ray proportional counter connected to a pc computer orients and characterizes single crystals in real time northstar software can index cubic hexagonal trigonal tetragonal orthorhombic monoclinic and triclinic crystals stereographic projections can be made from the current indexed pattern orientation accuracy of 1 4 o in regular mode of operation and 0.05 o in high resolution mode laue patterns can be stored displayed and printed
