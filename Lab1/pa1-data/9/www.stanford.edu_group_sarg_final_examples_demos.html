smart antennas research group demos benefits of mimo as we shall demonstrate with a simple simulation below the use of multiple transmit and receive antennas can improve the performance of wireless communication systems significantly the advantages of multiple input multiple output mimo systems can be summarized as diversity gain array gain interference reduction multiplexing gain in the simulation below we analyze how received power in a rayleigh flat fading wireless channel changes as the number of antennas are increased at the transmitter and receiver we observe that the power variation is reduced and power gain is increased as more antennas are employed to see the capacity improvement obtained by employing multiple antennas click here power with single transmit receive antenna system power when 2 transmit 2 receive antennas are employed
