conformational dynamics of single g protein coupled receptors in solution page 1 conformational dynamics of single g protein coupled receptors in solution samuel bockenhauer alexandre fuerstenberg xiao jie yao brian kobilka and we moerner bockenhauer et al j phys chem b 115 13328 2011 the abel trap allows us to observe single reporter dye labeled gpcrs for up to 1 second without surface attachment abel trap gpcrs regulate a host of cellular processes ligand binding green transmits signals to the rest of the cell via conformational change we observe a range of conformational changes probed by step like changes in the intensity and lifetime of the single reporter dye the distributions and timescales of these changes depend upon the presence and absence of bound ligand
