engineered piezoelectricity in graphene materials computation and theory group home research staff publications teaching contact engineered piezoelectricity in graphene back to research overview among the biggest challenges in harnessing the power of nanotechnology is achieving dynamic control of mechanical chemical and electronic properties of nanoscale devices many devices stand to benefit from such control including transistors sensors actuators energy harvesters motors robots and other locomotive devices in principle dynamic control could be obtained by applying external electric fields to piezoelectric materials but carbon based nanomaterials like two dimensional graphene which was awarded the 2010 nobel prize in physics are not intrinsically piezoelectric surface doping of graphene leads to piezoelectricty by selectively adsorbing atoms on the surface we have discovered that piezoelectricity can be engineered in nonpiezoelectric graphene ab initio density functional theory calculations have demonstrated that adsorbing different atoms on a single side of graphene results in varying piezoelectric magnitudes these piezoelectric magnitudes are found to be comparable to those in 3d piezoelectric materials this designer piezoelectric phenomenon is unique to the nanoscale and has potential to bring dynamical mechanical control to existing graphene based devices and other technologies one can also envision that this work could pave the way for the creation of revolutionary new devices based not just on graphene but also other 2d and low dimensional structures eg carbon nanotubes fullerenes etc as well publication ong mt reed ej engineered piezoelectricity in graphene acs nano 2012
