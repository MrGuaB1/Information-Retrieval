stanford university nmr facility what probe should you choose why would you want to use the standard probe 5mm pfg switchable x 1h 1 detect a nucleus other than proton all other probes are inverse probes the proton coil is the inner coil in the probe 13c and 15n can be detected on the 5mm triple resonance 1h 13c 15n triax pulsed field gradient probe but sensitivity will be less than on 5mm pfg switchable x 1h probe other nuclei cannot be detected on the 1h 13c 15n triax pulsed field gradient probe 2 low temperature the inverse probes have more limited temperature range as low as 20 degrees celsius as opposed to 100 for the 5mm pfg switchable x 1h 3 high temperature above 80 degrees celsius the inverse probes have more limited temperature range maximum high temperature of 80 degrees celsius the switchable probes have maximum high temperature of 150 degrees celsius 3 the standard parameters for routine experiments are for the 5mm pfg switchable x 1h probe 4 the 5mm pfg switchable x 1h is the standard probe so no probe changing is necessary 5 the 5mm pfg switchable x 1h probe is capable of acquiring all 2 channel pfg experiments gcosy ghsqc albeit with a lower signal to noise why would you want to use the 1h 13c 15n triax pulsed field gradient probe 1 all proton detect experiments will have better signal to noise why would you want to use the 5mm double resonance 1h x z pulsed gradient probe 1 detect protons on a heteronuclear experiment involving 1h and something other than 15n or 13c why would you want to use the 3mm triple resonance z pulsed field gradient probe 1 same as the 5mm hcn probe but you have only a small amount of sample nmr facility home stanford university department of chemistry stanford university all rights reserved stanford ca 94305 650 723 2300
