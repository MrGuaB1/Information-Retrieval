spintronic materials & devices stanford center for magnetic nanotechnology the wang group spintronic materials & devices spin transfer torque & spin transistor home projects publications people news group photos principal investigator s shan x wang & krishna saraswat sponsor s nanoelectronics research initiative intel the phenomenon of spin transfer torque or simply spin torque is first conceptualized by berger and slonczewski and experimentally verified by a group from cornell university on one hand if spins are injected from one ferromagnetic layer to another the conservation of spin angular momentum favors the second magnetization to be parallel to the first on the other hand if spins are reflected from another the conservation law favors the first magnetization to be antiparallel from the second spin torque based random access memory stt ram switches bits by the spin transfer torque effect is a promising candidate for a nonvolatile and fast magnetic memory in this project we will vary mgo thickness and explore novel magnetic electrode structures to achieve the desired properties needed for future generations of stt devices efficiently injecting spin polarized electrons from ferromagnetic materials fm into semiconductor sc has been one of the major challenges in spintronics fm oxide sc structure is considered as a good candidate for spin injection or detection because the tunnel contact between fm and sc might be ideal for solving the conductivity mismatch problem we are investigating current i vs voltage v characteristics of cofeb ge and cofeb mgo ge junctions in order to decipher the characteristics of these films and their interfaces which will pave the way for eventually fabricating spin transistors with efficient spin injector and spin detector
