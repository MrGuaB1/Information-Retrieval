cyber security for printers slac computer security search slac slac home computing home computing outages help computer security windows security passwords user education policies cyber security for networked printers and copiers an increasing number of services are being offered on printers and copiers and slac needs to be sure cyber security is kept in mind as new printers copiers are considered for purchase and deployment at slac it is advisable to involve slac computer security early in the evaluation process to insure that the printer copier will be allowed to remain on the slac network since each model is unique offering a unique experience it is impossible to provide blanket approval or rejection for any new offerings the cyber security evaluation will be based on the following list of recommendations guidelines security group recommendations guidelines vendor must provide support to slac personnel so that we don t rely on vendor service calls to address the security restrictions listed below the password used to administer the printer copier must be changeable and changed from the default asap if administered via the web then the administrator password must be encryped cleartext http is _not_ to be used this authentication should be protected via ssl or ssh or some other encrypted channel if it cannot be encrypted then web administration is not allowed and only the local console should be used the vendor must provide security patches in a timely manner any vulnerability left unpatched for 30 days would require the device to be shut down until the patch is available from vendor and installed on printer the device will be scanned for latest vulnerabilities multiple times day by slac computer security and it will also be scanned at least quarterly using sans top 20 tests if the scanning causes the printer copier problems it should be powered off until the vendor can fix or replace it printers copiers must be restricted from direct offsite internet access this is accomplished by placing it in internet free zone ifz when the sccs helpdesk provides ip addresses for printers and copiers they should be providing ifz addresses by default if not initially placed in ifz area of subnet it will be forced to move to ifz ip address when the next sans top 20 quarterly scan is run no user authentication to slac authenticators is to go across the net in clear text including to ldap servers e mail sending should allow authentication using smtp tls or equivalent though this is not required e mail from address must be configurable and the from address must be in our mailrouter database and they must point to an actively monitored mailbox all services must be configurable and must allow complete disable ie smtp ntp ftp http nfs ipx appletalk etc all unused services must be disabled if certificates are used the device must allow the use of real certificates slac uses thawte for ssl certificates device should support 802.1 x network authentication or have planned upgrade by vendor to support it device must support ipv6 or have a committed upgrade path from vendor for ipv6 note unix printing requires snmp v1 v2 on the printer do not disable snmp from networked printers removing r w access should be fine just leave r o access owner slac computer security last updated 07 22 2010 feedback please send to computer security feedback
