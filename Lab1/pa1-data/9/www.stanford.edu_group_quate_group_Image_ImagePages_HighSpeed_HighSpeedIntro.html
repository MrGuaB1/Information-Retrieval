high speed imaging introduction home the image above shows a schematic of the zno piezoresistive scanning afm probe this probe incorporates an actuator made of a thin zno film and a sensor which is a piezoresitor made with a doped silicon trace in the substrate since the actuator is integrated on the probe and is several orders of magnitude smaller than a conventional actuator we have been able to demonstrate scanning tip speeds that are 100 times higher than standard scanning probes high speed imaging the conventional way home micromachining imaging lithography biosensors other work questions comments mail quatewebmaster
