the future of tcp train wreck or evolution the future of tcp train wreck or evolution stanford clean slate internet program stanford university april 1 2008 stanford university stanford ca sponsored by the stanford clean slate internet program cisco systems the stanford computer forum home program committee important dates agenda registration logistics participants contact workshop description spurred on by a widespread belief that tcp is showing its age and needs replacing and a deeper understanding of the dynamics of congestion control the research community has brought forward many new congestion control algorithms there has been lots of debate about the relative merits and demerits of the new schemes and a standardization effort is under way in the ietf but before the next congestion control mechanism is deployed it will need to be deployed widely in operating systems and in some cases in switches and routers too this will be a long road requiring the buy in of many people researchers product developers and business leaders too our own experience of proposing new congestion control algorithms has been met with the challenge show me the compelling need for a new congestion control mechanisms and what will really happen to the internet and my business if we keep tcp just the way it is as a community we need examples that are simple to understand and demonstrate a compelling need for change we call them the train wreck scenarios examples might show that distribution of video over wireless in the home will come to a halt without new algorithms or that p2p traffic will bring the whole network crashing down or that huge high performance data centers need new algorithms whatever your favorite example we believe that if we are collectively armed with a handful of mutually agreed examples it will be much easier to make a business case for change or put another way if we can t articulate compelling examples to industry leaders then is the cost and risk of change worth it the goal of the workshop is to identify a handful of really compelling demonstrations of the impending train wreck the outcome will be a set of canonical examples that we will use to persuade industry of the need for change you can choose the way you present your demonstration you could bring equipment and show a live demo you could show simulations or animations or you could produce a video showing a real or synthetic demo whatever method you choose the goal is to create a case that will persuade a mildly technical but influential business leader of the need for change we will invite a panel of judges to give prizes for the most compelling examples in two categories 1 the overall most compelling example which will be judged on a combination of the technical merits and the presentation of the scenario and 2 the most technically compelling example which will be judged on its technical merit alone without consideration of the way it is presented the whole purpose of the workshop it to focus on the problem not the solutions we are most definitely not interested in your favorite scheme or ours so we need some ground rules no one is allowed to mention a specific mechanism algorithm or proposal at any time during the workshop not in their talk not in a panel and not in questions to the speakers the only mechanisms that will be allowed mention are tcp in its standard and deployed flavors and idealized alternatives for purposes of demonstration for example comparing tcp with an oracle that provides instantaneous optimal rates to each flow we will video the entire workshop and all the demonstrations and make it publicly available on the internet we will make any proceedings and talks available too the goal is to open up the demonstrations for public scrutiny and feedback after the event the event is hosted by the stanford clean slate program and local arrangements will be made by the stanford computer forum nick mckeown and nandita dukkipati the workshop has received offers of support and funding from cisco systems and microsoft last updated march 30 2008
