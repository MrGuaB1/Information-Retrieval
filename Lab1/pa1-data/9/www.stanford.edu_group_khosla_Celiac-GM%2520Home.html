celiac gm home celiac sprue is a multi factorial disease in which genetically predisposed individuals suffer an intestinal inflammatory response to ingested gluten from wheat and related proteins from barley and rye currently the only treatment for celiac sprue also called celiac disease coeliac disease and non tropic sprue is adherence to a strict gluten free diet gfd such a diet is difficult to maintain as gluten is the second most common food additive behind sucrose figure depiction of the intestinal mucosa with emphasis on the factors that take part in the development of the adaptive immune response in celiac sprue a immunotoxic sequences ingluten are resistant to processing by luminal and brush border enzymes these gluten derived peptides survive digestion and can be transported across the mucosal epithelium as polypeptides at some point along this trajectory these peptides are deamidated by tissue transglutaminase tg2 which in the intestinal mucosa is located mainly extracellularly in the subepithelial region but is also found in the brush border cd4 t cells in the lamina propria recognize deamidated gluten peptides predominantly presented by hla dq2 or dq8 molecules on the cell surface of antigen presenting cells apcs b immunofluorescence staining of tg2 pink hla dq green and t cells cd3 purple in the small intestinal mucosa of an untreated celiac sprue patient note that there is a close spatial relationship between tg2 apcs that express hla dq and t cells just beneath the epithelium immunofluorescent image courtesy of h scott rikshospitalet sollid 2002 1 the khosla lab and collaborators have suggested three distinct ways of developing therapeutics for celiac sprue that exploit our molecular understanding of its progression contact info useful links publications people professor khosla research interests home
