introduction to neurospora sexual biologysexual the perkins lab neurospora genetics and biology department of biological sciences stanford university introduction to neurospora sexual biology and the accompanying photo series nb raju shear and dodge 1927 described the sexual biology of two eight spored heterothallic species n crassa and n sitophila and one four spored apparently homothallic species n tetrasperma later called pseudohomothallic they named the genus neurospora because of the nerve like ornamentation on developing ascospore walls fig 1 dodge 1927 described the nuclear behavior responsible for heterothallism in the eight spored species and for pseudohomothallism in the four spored species fig 2 see raju 1980 1992 several hundred neurospora photos are shown here organized into various chapters in addition to the series on normal ascus development in wild type n crassa and n tetrasperma other series illustrate ascus and ascospore development in several mutants chromosome rearrangements and spore killers other series illustrate ascus development in related ascomycetes for example coniochaeta tetraspora and cochliobolus heterostrophus staining mcclintock 1945 showed that meiosis and chromosome behavior in neurospora are very similar to those of higher plants and animals see singleton 1953 mcclintock singleton and eg barry have used an aceto orcein staining procedure for studying meiotic chromosome behavior i use an iron hematoxylin procedure which is effective not only for staining chromosomes but also for nucleolus spindles spindle pole bodies and the ascus apical pore raju 1980 i have also used the dna specific acriflavin for detailed meiotic chromosome analysis raju 1986 a ten fold dilution of ferric acetate and hematoxylin solutions has been used for lightly staining unfixed rosettes of maturing asci figs 3 6 sizes perithecia of n crassa measure 400 x 500 m fig 9 and produce well over 200 asci mature asci are 18 20 m x 175 200 m and mature ascospores 14 15 x 28 30 m contain up to 64 nuclei although the nuclei in mature ascospores and hyphae do not exceed 2 m in diameter the meiotic nuclei in asci are much larger at pachytene the nuclei can reach 12 15 mm in diameter and the chromosomes measure from 6 to 18 mm long figs 3 4 the highly condensed metaphase anaphase chromosomes during meiosis are no larger than 0.5 2.0 m in diameter however figs 5 7 8 times for studies of ascus development we routinely grow the protoperithecial parent female on petri plates containing synthetic crossing medium for 5 days and fertilize with conidia or mycelial fragments from a strain of opposite mating type the developing perithecia contain ascogenous hyphae and young asci at 3 days after fertilization various meiotic division stages at 4 5 days spore delimitation and maturation at 5 8 days fig 10 ascospores from individual asci are ejected forcefully as discrete groups shortly thereafter return to the photos page to view other series of photographs for permission to use these photos and copyright information click here click on thumbnails to view enlarged photos with captions fig 1 ascospore striations fig 2 ascus drawings fig 3 pachytene orcein stain fig 4 pachytene acriflavin stain fig 5 metaphase i hematoxylin stain fig 6 sk2 x wt dilute hematoxylin fig 7 ascospore nuclei fig 8 anaphase ii small chromosomes fig 9 perithecia scanning em fig 10 perithecia 90 mm petri plate permission and copyright you may use any of these photos for educational purposes not for profit we ask that you use a credit line citing the original reference and the photographer high resolution versions of these photos are available upon request from nb raju's photo collection see contacts if previously published photos are to be used in publication permission will of course be required from the publisher see the captions of enlarged photos perkins lab home department home university home contact us 2004 david d perkins
