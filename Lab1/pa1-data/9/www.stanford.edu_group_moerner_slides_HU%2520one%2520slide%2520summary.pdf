super resolution imaging of the nucleoid associated protein hu in caulobacter crescentus page 1 super resolution imaging of the nucleoid associated protein hu in caulobacter crescentus super resolution imaging combined with spatial point statistics allowed for the visualization and quantification of cell cycle dependent clustering of the important nucleoid associated protein hu in caulobacter crescentus on length scales far below the diffraction limit of light slight clustering was observed in swarmer a and stalked b stages of the cell cycle while dramatic clustering was observed in pre divisional cells c these results strongly imply changes in chromosomal organization throughout the cell cycle steven lee michael thompson monica schwartz lucy shapiro we moerner see biophys j lett 2011 in press red spatially random simulations blue data
