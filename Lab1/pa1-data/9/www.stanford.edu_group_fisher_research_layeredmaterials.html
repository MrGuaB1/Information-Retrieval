research layered chalcogenides research layered chalcogenides the rare earth r tri tellurides rte3 are model incommensurate charge density wave compounds and provide us with a unique opportunity to study the electronic structure of a material deep in such a state the cdw gap is large up to 400 mev so we are able to study the coexistence between gapped and metallic parts of the fermi surface via several powerful and complimentary techniques the crystal structure of rte3 consists of double layers of square planar te sheets sandwiched between rte blocks shown above the rte blocks do not contribute to the fermi surface but the te sheets have partially filled electronic bands formed from te px and py orbitals large regions of this simple quasi 2d fermi surface are nested by a single wave vector incommensurate with the underlying lattice however the nesting does not gap the entire fermi surface and small remaining sections give rise to a metallic conductivity publications most recent incommensurate magnetic order in tbte 3 ultrafast electron dynamics in the charge density wave material tbte 3 anharmonic order parameter oscillations and lattice coupling in strongly driven 1 t tas 2 and tbte 3 charge density wave compounds a multiple pulse femtosecond laser spectroscopy study coherent dynamics of macroscopic electronic order through a symmetry breaking transition temperature dependence of the excitation spectrum in the charge density wave erte 3 and hote 3 systems raman scattering evidence for a cascade evolution of the charge density wave collective amplitude mode fermi surface evolution across multiple cdw transitions in erte 3 observation of two separate charge density wave transitions in gd 2 te 5 via transmission electron microscopy and high resolution x ray diffraction click for additional publications optical properties of the charge density wave rare earth tritelluride compounds a view on prte3 pressure induced superconducting phase in the charge density wave compound tbte3 pressure induced quenching of the charge density wave state in rare earth tritellurides observed by x ray diffraction high pressure transport and thermodynamic properties of cete3 pressure dependence of the single particle excitation in the charge density wave cete3 system single particle and collective mode couplings associated with 1 and 2 directional electronic ordering in metallic rte3 r ho dy tb evidence for coupling between charge density waves and phonons in two dimensional rare earth tellurides transient electronic structure and melting of a charge density wave in tbte3 de haas van alphen oscillations in the charge density wave compound lanthanum tritelluride late3 magnetic properties of the charge density wave compounds rte3 r y la ce pr nd sm gd tb dy ho er & tm optical properties of the charge density wave polychalcogenide compounds r2te5 r nd sm and gd angle resolved photoemission study of the evolution of band structure and charge density wave properties in rte3 pressure dependence of the optical properties of the charge density wave compound late2 charge density wave formation in r2te5 r nd sm gd effect of chemical pressure on the charge density wave transition in rare earth tritellurides rte3 stm studies of tbte3 evidence for a fully incommensurate charge density wave optical properties of the ce and la ditelluride charge density wave compounds pressure dependence of the charge density wave gap in rare earth tri tellurides chemical pressure and hidden one dimensional behavior in rare earth tri telluride charge density wave compounds thermodynamic and transport properties of yte3 late3 and cete3 electronic structure and charge density wave formation in late1 95 and cete2 00 fermi surface nesting and charge density wave formation in rare earth tritellurides fermi surface reconstruction in the cdw state of cete3 observed by photoemission contacts jiun haw chu james analytis ian fisher back to home page home fisher research group geballe laboratory for advanced materials dept of applied physics stanford university ca 94305 4045 last updated dec 31st 2011 tumblr stats
