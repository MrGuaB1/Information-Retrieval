banana development page 1 the perkins lab neurospora genetics and biology department of biological sciences stanford university ascospore development in the banana mutant of neurospora crassa nb raju banana ban was isolated as a spontaneous morphological mutant newmeyer and galeazzi 1974 it shows four abnormal phenotypes giant ascospores abnormal ascogenous tissue abnormal vegetative morphology and female sterility the first two phenotypes are dominant and the latter two are recessive the accompanying 32 photographs illustrate abnormal ascospore development reverted ascogenous tissue and the interaction of two ascus mutants banana and peak giant ascospores in crosses of wild type x ban each ascus cuts out a single giant ascospore enclosing all four products of meiosis and their mitotic derivatives fig 1 raju and newmeyer 1977 early ascus development and meiosis are apparently normal spindles and spindle pole body plaques also appear normal through meiosis and the first postmeiotic mitosis however unlike in wild type asci where all eight nuclei line up in single file prior to spore delimitation the pairs of sister nuclei from each spindle fail to line up but remain on opposite sides of the ascus a single giant ascospore is now cut out that encloses all eight nuclei figs 2 8 after a single mitosis in the just delimited giant ascospores most of the spores contain 16 nuclei figs 9 11 however 10 of young ascospores contain 32 nuclei perhaps because a second postmeiotic mitosis had occurred before the spore wall was formed fig 12 giant ascospores develop longitudinal striations as they pigment and mature fig 13 four or five additional mitoses occur in the mature black ascospores synchronous mitoses and probable endoreduplication in abnormal ascogenous cells in older perithecia after 50 to 75 asci have been differentiated most of the later formed crozier and precrozier cells fail to differentiate new asci instead they either and revert to mitosis figs 14 24 or form enlarged nuclei figs 25 27 mitoses are synchronous in the reverted crozier and precrozier cells figs 21 24 the nuclei and chromosomes are much larger than in vegetative hyphae providing superb material for observing the stages of mitosis we have used these multinucleate cells to show that chromosome behavior in mitosis is essentially the same as that in higher eukaryotes raju 1984 raju and newmeyer 1977 ascospore inclusions in the developing asci ascospore delimiting membranes are formed at the periphery of the ascus during interphase ii following a postmeiotic mitosis these membranes invaginate to sequester individual nuclei and the immediately surrounding cytoplasm into eight uninucleate ascospores since a single giant ascospore requires less spore delimiting membrane than do eight normal size ascospores there appears to be a surplus elongated tubular inclusions are formed inside the giant ascospores which we interpret as being the unused wall membranes figs 28 30 similar ascospore inclusions have also been found in the giant round ascospores that result from the interaction of banana with a swollen ascus mutant peak figs 31 32 use of banana in cell biology and genetic analysis the banana mutation was used to rescue spore killer sensitive nuclei by enclosing them together with killer nuclei in the giant ascospores raju 1979 1994 ban was also used to show diffusion of gfp tagged histone h1 protein across the cytoplasm of giant ascospores that are heterokaryotic for tagged and untagged nuclei freitag et al 2004 return to the photos page to view other series of photographs for permission to use these photos and copyright information click here click on thumbnails to view enlarged photos with captions previous page 1 2 3 next fig 1 banana ascospores fig 2 interphase ii fig 3 prometaphase iii fig 4 anaphase iii fig 5 interphase iii fig 6 interphase iii fig 7 giant spore cutting fig 8 giant spore cutting fig 9 giant spore cutting fig 10 giant spore 16 nuclei fig 11 giant spores fig 12 giant spore 32 nuclei permission and copyright you may use any of these photos for educational purposes not for profit we ask that you use a credit line citing the original reference and the photographer high resolution versions of these photos are available upon request from nb raju's photo collection see contacts if previously published photos are to be used in publication permission will of course be required from the publisher see the captions of enlarged photos perkins lab home department home university home contact us 2004 david d perkins
