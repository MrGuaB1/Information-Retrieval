pido who we are results pido process integration design optimization architecture engineering and construction aec professionals typically achieve very few design and analysis iterations during the conceptual stage of a project one primary cause is limitations in the processes and software tools used by the aec industry the aerospace industry has overcome similar limitations using a technique known as process integration and design optimization pido resulting in a greater number of design iterations and improved processes and product performance this research investigates the application of pido to aec with a focus on structural thermal and cost performance we are demonstrating how pido can enable orders of magnitude improvement in process and product performance
