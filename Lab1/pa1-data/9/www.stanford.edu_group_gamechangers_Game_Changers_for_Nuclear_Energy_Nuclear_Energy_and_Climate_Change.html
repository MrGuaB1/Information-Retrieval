climate change and nuclear energy climate change and nuclear energy if there is no fundamental change in the way energy is generated and consumed the current scientific consensus predicts significant global temperature increases in the coming century this change may lead to desertification reduction in arable land and fresh potable water ecosystem destruction and decreased natural resource availability as well as the submersion of populated land areas while there is little scientific dissent on the fundamentals of climate change the response of governments the energy manufacturing and transportation sectors and the public has been piecemeal varying by country and region it is however a safe assumption that the energy mix globally will look very different fifty years from now if nuclear is to assume a larger role in the new energy picture it will be largely because of environmental and political factors action on climate change is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a nuclear renaissance the preferred means of electricity generation in the future will likely depend on a large variety of factors some of which have their origins in engineering and technical problems and some of which are more political in scope will climate action be a game changer for nuclear energy consequences for nuclear source nasa earth observatory based on ipcc fourth assessment report 2007 how do we predict the future climate what will it take for governments to get serious about climate change what form will new policies take what does this mean for nuclear energy
