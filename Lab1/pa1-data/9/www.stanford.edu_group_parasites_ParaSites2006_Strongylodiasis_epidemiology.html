untitled document epidemiology as mentioned in the introduction strongyloides is generally found in the tropics and subtropics in areas with heavy rainfall including sub saharan africa south and southeast asia central america and south america 2 in can also be found in temperate areas including the appalachian and southeastern united states 4 6 it is estimated that about 100 200 million people worldwide are infected but this is likely an underestimate because infection can often be asymptomatic and thus undetected 4 in addition because of its autoinfective properties this parasite has the ability to persist for years in non endemic areas strongyloides is most common in areas with populations that customarily don t wear shoes and defecate directly into the soil or deposit feces near areas commonly walked on as this creates an environment conducive to transmission see prevention strategies it is interesting to note the the distribution of strongyloides is very focal according to dr brian blackburn an infectious disease expert from the department of medicine at stanford university it depends a lot on local hygiene moisture and soil factors thus even in endemic or hyperendemic areas some places will have little to no prevalence of the parasite while others nearby will have a high prevalence because children are more likely to be outdoors in contaminated soil with bare feet infection can frequently occur in childhood rural populations and those of a lower socioeconomic status also more frequently contain strongyloides infection 5 the countries highlighted in yellow have sporadic endemicity on the range of 1 3 those that are orange are endemic while those that are red are generally hyperendemic with the highest frequency of strongyloides infection
