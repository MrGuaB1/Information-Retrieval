stanford nhlbi proteomics center stanford proteomics home mission tech people contact stanford university proteomics center proteomics of blood components in autoimmune disease this proteomics center represents an interdisciplinary effort to explore and converge results from 4 different platform technologies that analyze intracellular and secreted blood cell proteins related to systemic autoimmune disease processes a main component of the center is the development of relational software and statistical analysis regimens that will allow the comparison and correlation of different datasets generated by these diverse technologies each platform employs equipment that is familiar to nearly all academic research centers including fluorescence activated cell sorters facs robotic microarray printers and scanners and microfabrication design for capillary electrophoresis equipment we are applying this approach to tractable animal models of two distinct autoimmune diseases systemic lupus erythematosus sle a disease mediated predominantly by b lymphocytes and rheumatoid arthritis ra a disease mediated predominantly by t lymphocytes later years of the proposal will focus on the study of biological specimens derived from human patients as clinical samples that are clinically relevant manifestations of autoimmune disease represented by the disease models contact us for more info nolan group multiparameter phosphoprotein analysis by flow cytometry in immune lineage cells utz & santiago groups multiplexing of cytokine profiles by chip based microcapillary analysis steinman & robinson groups antigen chip arrays for autoantibody profiling chu & tibsharani groups megaset cross dataset correlations for clustering of diverse proteomic datasets this project funded by national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi proteomics initiative home page
