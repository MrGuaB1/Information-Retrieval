research 5d magnetism research 5d magnetism the interplay between spin orbital and charge degrees of freedom in 3d transition metal oxides has proven to be a rich area of research in recent years despite the wide array of interesting physics found in these materials much less is known about whether similar behavior can be found in related 4d and 5d systems for which both the extent of the d orbitals and larger spin orbit coupling cause a different balance between the relevant energy scales in this new project we are exploring the magnetic structures and phase transitions of some novel 5d transition metal oxides figure shows structure of the 5d1 mott insulator ba2naoso6 single crystal is approx 1 mm in diameter publications most recent ferromagnetism in the mott insulator ba2naoso6 contacts ann erickson ian fisher back to home page home fisher research group geballe laboratory for advanced materials dept of applied physics stanford university ca 94305 4045 last updated tumblr stats
