untitled document life cycle the life cycle of diphyllobothrium latum is illustrated below courtesy of the cdc the entire life cycle can be summed up in 9 stages with 4 hosts 1 immature d latum eggs are passed in the feces of the human host 2 these eggs then complete development in fresh water life cycle continues in crustaceans 3 small ciliated coracidium larvae hatch from mature eggs and swim about until ingested by crustaceans 4 the second larval stage is completed in the crustacean with the development of the procercoid life cycle then moves to fish 5 infected crustaceans are the ingested by small freshwater fish the procercoid larva are then released from the crustacean into the fish the larvae continue to develop in the flesh of the fish developing into the plerocercoid stage which is the infective stage for humans if humans ingest this fish they will become infected however the fish ingesting an infected crustacean is small and usually not prey for any mammals 6 thus a larger predator fish ingests the smaller infected fish the plerocercoid may infect the larger fish but will not continue to grow as the fish is only a transport host life cycle completes itself in human or other suitable mammal 7 human or other mammal ingests raw or undercooked infected fish 8 plerocerciod larva is not digested but instead remains in the small intestine of its new host and grows to adulthood 9 proglottids release immature eggs completing the cycle
