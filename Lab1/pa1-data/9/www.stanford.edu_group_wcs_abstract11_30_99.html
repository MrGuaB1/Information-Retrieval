abstract semi blind fir multichannel identification methods the purpose of semi blind channel identification methods is to exploit the information used by blind methods as well as the information coming from known symbols semi blind techniques robustify the blind and training problems and offer better performance than these two methods different ways of building semi blind criteria are possible optimal methods naturally incorporate the knowledge of input symbols and provide semi blind solutions when the symbols are arbitrarily dispersed in the burst we focus on suboptimal methods that are based on grouped known symbols a training sequence the associated criteria are formed as a linear combination of a blind and a training sequence based criterion we propose quadratic semi blind algorithms which are of particular interest because of their low computational complexity and illustrate how to properly choose the weights of the linear combination last modified mon nov 22 14 00 17 pst 1999
