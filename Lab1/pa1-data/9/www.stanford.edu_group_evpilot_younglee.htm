young haeng lee introducing young haeng lee i joined dr criddle's research group as a postdoctoral research fellow in winter 2004 prior to my current position i worked in the area of anaerobic biological dechlorination as a postdoctoral research fellow at the university of maryland in college park md for 1 yr i received my ph d thesis title reductive biotransformation and decolorization of reactive anthraquinone dyes in environmental engineering at georgia institute of technology in atlanta ga previously i attended korea university in seoul korea where i earned an ms in environmental engineering a bs in civil and environmental engineering my current work focuses on the development of membrane coupled mf uf anaerobic bioreactors anmbr for sewage treatment and the optimization of energy production and recovery from anaerobic digestion processes the effect of various operational parameters on the anmbr performance ie hydrolysis production and consumption of vfas methane production and biomass production will be evaluated thoroughly and simulated using a michaelis menten type kinetic model the performance and fouling of membranes under different operational conditions will be tested and the effect of various cleaning methods on the membrane performance will be investigated in addition to mbr processes my research interests are related to environmental biotechnology and bioprocesses for the treatment of various wastewaters bioremediation of groundwater and soils contaminated with recalcitrant organics biological nutrient removal from municipal wastewater and agricultural wastes modeling and simulation of biological municipal wastewater treatment systems kinetics and modeling of biological treatment processes when not in the lab and office i enjoy spending time playing golf shopping playing ps2 hiking and watching movies young haeng lee terman engineering center room b56 380 panama mall stanford ca 94305 4020 leeyh stanford edu
