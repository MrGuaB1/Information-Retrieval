home page chua lab home research publications people photos contact research interests our lab is interested in understanding molecular processes that underlie aging and age associated pathologies in mammals we focus on a family of genes the sirts which regulate stress resistance and lifespan in lower organisms such as yeast worms and flies in mammals we recently uncovered a number of ways in which sirt factors may contribute to cellular and organismal aging by regulating resistance to various forms of stress we have now begun to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which these sirt factors function in particular we are interested in how sirt factors regulate chromatin the molecular structure in which the dna of mammalian genomes is packaged and how such functions may link genome maintenance to stress resistance and aging affiliations stanford university school of medicine department of medicine division of endocrinology gerontology and metabolism geriatric research education and clinical center grecc va palo alto health care system
