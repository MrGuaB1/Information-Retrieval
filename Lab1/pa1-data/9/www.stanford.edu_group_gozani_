gozani lab gozani lab home research people protocols publications contact we study the molecular mechanisms by which chromatin signaling networks effect nuclear and epigenetic programs and how dysregulation of these pathways leads to disease our work centers on the biology of lysine methylation a principal chromatin regulatory mechanism that directs epigenetic processes we study how lysine methylation events are generated sensed and transduced and how these chemical marks integrate with other nuclear signaling systems to govern diverse cellular functions
