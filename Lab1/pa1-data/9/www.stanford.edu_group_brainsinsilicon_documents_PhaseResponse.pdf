prc for inhibition calculating the prc page 1 prc for inhibition slow inhibition applied at various phases near 25ms delays spiking most inhibition is also ineffective immediately after and before spiking immediately after the driving force ie vm is small immediately before there isn t enough time to rise  5 of 8 calculating the prc x t a prc t t 0 t printed from the mathematica help browser 3 1988 2005 wolfram research inc all rights reserved page 2 shifting xhtl up by a corresponds to shifting it left by prchtl the prc and the membrane voltage increase ha are related by x t prc t x t a prc t x 1 x t a t which requires us to solve for the waveform and find it's inverse  6 of 8 quadratic integrate and fire neuron neuron's phase plot left and prcs right threshold is at x 0 due to offset this model can be solved analytically x t cot t with t  prc t cot 1 a cot t t the prc depends on a as well becoming more asymmetrical as it gets large because larger kicks send neuron across the minimum where they are most helpful only if they happen earlier  7 of 8 4 printed from the mathematica help browser 1988 2005 wolfram research inc all rights reserved page 3 weak coupling x t a prc t t 0 t x for small a x yields a good approximation for prchtl extrapolating xhtl linearly yields x t prc t a prc t a x t predicts that phase advance is greatest when x is minimum at the inflection point for the quadratic i&f neuron we get x t 1 sin2 t prc t a sin2 t this matches the a 0.1 curve in the previous slide  8 of 8 printed from the mathematica help browser 5 1988 2005 wolfram research inc all rights reserved page 4 inhibition quadratic neuron's prc for inhibition ha 0.1 1 2 3 the prc becomes more asymmetrical as a gets large in this case as well but it is skewed toward latter times because the kicks send the neuron back across the minimum 6 printed from the mathematica help browser 1988 2005 wolfram research inc all rights reserved
