research html pbx deficient mice using gene targeting techniques we have created mice that are null for pbx1 their characterization shows that pbx1 is essential for development the phenotypes of pbx1 null embryos provide compelling support for its in vivo contributions to hox function during many aspects of embryonic development these mice are being used to investigate the roles of pbx1 in various cellular signaling and growth control pathways publications selleri l depew mj jacobs y chanda sk tsang ky cheah kse rubenstein jlr o gorman s cleary ml requirement for pbx1 in patterning of the skeleton and programming chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation development 128 3543 3557 2001 dimartino jf selleri l traver d firpo mt rhee j warnke r o gorman s weissman il cleary ml the hox cofactor and proto oncogene pbx1 is required for maintenance of definitive hematopoiesis in the fetal liver blood 98 618 626 2001 kim sk selleri l lee js zhang ay gu x jacobs y cleary ml pbx1 inactivation disrupts pancreas development and in ipf1 deficient mice promotes diabetes mellitus nature genetics 30 430 435 2002 pbx1 ko studies
