it's a yolk son home research people publications pictures sculpture by carolyn chen it's a yolk son unlike most other oncogenes v myb is capable of transforming blood cells but not fibroblasts however it is very difficult to introduce cloned dna directly into primary hematopoietic cells therefore we have developed a system in which a retrovirus carrying both a dominantly selectable marker gene neo and a particular myb gene is used to produce an infectious virus the small particles budding from the infected cell in the electron micrograph below left em of infected cells vector alone v myb infected primary cell cultures embryonic yolk sac cells contain many precursors of the myelomonocytic lineage these cells normally differentiate and stop dividing when cultured center panel above however v myb can block their differentiation and cause their growth to continue in a fashion similar to leukemia right panel above this assay has been used to characterize a variety of mutant forms of the v myb and c myb proteins in order to map protein domains and to correlate protein structure and function one general conclusion of these studies is that transcriptional regulation by myb proteins is necessary but not sufficient for transformation ibanez and lipsick j virol 62 1981 1988 1988 lane ibanez garcia graf and lipsick mol cell biol 10 2591 2598 1990 grasser graf and lipsick mol cell biol 11 3987 3996 1991 dini and lipsick mol cell biol 13 7334 7348 1993 chen fields and lipsick oncogene 11 1771 1779 1995 fu and lipsick j virol 70 5600 10 1996 wang dm lipsick js oncogene 21 1611 1615 2002
