stanford university nmr facility how to measure t1 on a varian spectrometer set up appropriate 1h parameters normally should acquire 1d 1h spectrum first acquire a normal 1d with correct 90 pulse process phase correctly type a macro dot1 the computer asks you questions answer them as correctly as possible for shortest t1 guess 0.1 s for proton for longest t1 guess 5s for proton for length of experiment time it depends upon concentration so most samples guess 0.1 hours start acquisition type go the data can be processed with wft dssh dssh display stacked spectra horizontally then analyzed with the menu buttons t1 proc then t1 analysis which are accessible through the analyze and exponential menu buttons the t1 proc will select the resonances and measure the intensity the t1 analysis will fit the data to an exponential to manually set threshold type ds 12 to display last spectrum then set threshold as in standard 1d next type fp to measure the peak heights of the resonances to analyze the data measure the t1s type t1s this will give a list of t1 values only alternatively for more information type t1 to print the data highlighting the output and copy paste to text editor works also obtaining a line list is useful to identify what t1 value goes with what resonance so type pll page nmr facility home stanford university department of chemistry stanford university all rights reserved stanford ca 94305 650 723 2300
