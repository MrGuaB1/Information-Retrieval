sue extended research ideas overheads glossary references skills classic extended research ideas please see the classroom experiments for other ideas that could easily be extended into longer term experiments experiments and sperm experiments these are ideas that go beyond the one period classroom experience some could be appropriate for special interest students others for science fair projects etc each web page shows a new skill or method and suggestions for new investigations listed in order of increasing difficulty see also the scientific method shaking simulating wave action on young embryos ultraviolet light effects uv causes damage to genetic and protein material in the eggs and sperm how much does it take and what is affected modified seawater formulations what are the effects of varying formulas on fertilization and development what happens when the magnesium is left out calcium sodium osmotic vs ionic is it the ions in the seawater or the osmotic pressure that is important for fertilization and normal development artificial activation shown are several ways to activate the egg without a sperm are males needed at all carnoy's fixative this fixative is used to preserve detail for later examination of embryos fixatives work by selective extraction and preservation what can you see in the fixed developing embryo you could not see in the live ones isolating the mitotic apparatus illustrates mechanisms for removing the plasma membrane and other cell components to enhance viewing of microtubules chromosomes and centrosomes in the dividing cell gamete storage gamete storage whereas we can keep cow and sheep gametes and embryos for years at best we can keep sea urchin gametes for only a few weeks but even this is an improvement over the past where urchin eggs essentially had to be fertilized when fresh examples of student work egyptian project page see how above principles have actually been applied in a real research project
