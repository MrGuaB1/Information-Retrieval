mining mining currently about 68000 tons of natural uranium are required per year to operate the world's nuclear reactors by contrast a single 500 mw coal power plant requires more than a million tons of coal per year of operation only about two thirds of this uranium is mined the rest comes from reprocessing used fuel extracting extra u235 from depleted tails and downblended military stocks the 2007 red book estimates that existing recoverable resources of uranium are sufficient to meet increased demand for nuclear energy over the next century widespread acceptance of this view has led many experts to suggest the once through fuel cycle as the best option for future nuclear development past experience suggests that increasing commodity prices will spur further exploration however high grade 2 or above ore is rare and the energy costs associated with extracting and milling the uranium are higher for low grade ore additionally natural uranium deposits do not necessarily occur in the countries with the greatest reliance on nuclear power this raises important energy security issues while these factors may shape the evolution of nuclear power worldwide they are not likely to be game changers perceived or real uranium shortages would likely lead to the construction of breeder reactors or the development of higher burnup conventional reactors similarly given the relative insensitivity of nuclear power economics to the price of uranium different methods of uranium extraction are not likely to be game changers mining and milling game changers limited uranium shortage of recoverable resources thorium alternate fuel cycles u from seawater japanese method triple the cost of recovery from the ground front end
