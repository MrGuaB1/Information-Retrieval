scanning probe array introduction home image of 10 zno scanning probes these 10 probes are part of an array of 50 probes they each have their own integrated actuator and sensor and are able to collect information at tip speeds that are measured in mm s instead of um s while the integrated piezoresistive sensor is built into each cantilever and therefore well suited for further expansion into large arrays there are two disadvantages to using a piezoresistor as the sensor first in this configuration the piezoresistor is not as sensitive as the optical lever second each cantilever requires an output signal trace for the piezoresistor which takes up needed space on the die scanning probe arrays interdigital array schematic home micromachining imaging lithography biosensors other work questions comments mail quatewebmaster
