faq pc nic and network switch conflict faq pc nic and network switch conflict 09 july 2001 slac nt home eudora faq currently we experience errors from different conflicts between the pc network interface card nic and the cisco switches deployed at slac auto detect set at either the nic or cisco switch give rise often to errors please do not use auto detect instead set the nic to 10 half duplex unless your network tap has been set otherwise some nic's set at 10 half duplex on switched network which is also set at 10 half duplex are encountering higher error rates jointly desktop support and networking has changed both these nic's and switches to 10 full duplex however if the pc with such nic setting is moved to another network tap at another setting then the networking will fail so the nic and the network tap should be labelled similarly pc's with nic set at 100 full duplex will need to be reset if it moves to another type of network tap feedback desktop admin
