improvements to phoenix stanford university medical center dept of molecular pharmacology dept of microbiology & immunology nolan lab 8 improvements to retroviral producer lines phoenix systems first we added the ability to monitor gag pol production on a cell by cell basis by intro ducing an ires cd8 32 surface marker expression cassette downstream of the reading frame of the gag pol construct ires internal ribosome entry site sequences allow sec ondary or tertiary protein translation from a single mrna tran script 33 thus cd8 expression is a direct reflection of intracellular gag pol and the stability of the producer cell populationis ability to produce gag pol can be readily monitored by flow cytometry second for both the gag pol and envelope constructs non moloney promoters were used to minimize recombination potential with introduced retroviral constructs and different promoters for gag pol and envelope were used to minimize their inter recombination potential gag pol was introduced with hygromycin as the co selectable marker and the envelope proteins were introduced with diphtheria resistance as the co selectable marker related links home page interests members mta forms plasmid maps retroviral systems genetic screens library systems protocols tutorials publications contact virus chat
