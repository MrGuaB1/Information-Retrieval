replacing the heads building drums with stanford taiko introduction history process thank yous replacing the drum heads eventually the drum heads will get worn out and should be replaced there is no need to build an entirely new drum when replacing the drum head will make it sound as good as new it is possible that you do not even need a new head if the old head is not worn too thin but just sounds flat you can remove the tacks and try to restretch it the best part is that the skin won t need to be broken in afterward so it will sound good right away according to mark miyoshi the reinforcement inside the rim of the drum eventually starts to separate from the body as the wood expands and contracts check the reinforcements when you are reskinning a drum drums without rim reinforcement can often collapse when you are trying to rehead the drum if the drum is very oval shaped chances are that it does not have any rim reinforcement if you are concerned that the drum could break when you are removing the head but the head needs replacing try cutting off just the top part of the head leaving a tacked band of skin around the side of the drum this will help hold the body together until you can reinforce the drum if there are too many tack holes in the edge of the drum mark miyoshi recommends taking bamboo skewers cutting small pins and driving them into the holes before reskinning back drum manual written by alix koyama and dylan solomon please visit the acknowledgements page to see the many people who helped us with this project
