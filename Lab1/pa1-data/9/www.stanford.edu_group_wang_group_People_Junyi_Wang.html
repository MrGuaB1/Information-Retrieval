junyi wang stanford center for magnetic nanotechnology the wang group junyi was admitted into the ph d program in 2010 education bs peking university e mail junyi stanford dot edu junyi wang home projects publications people news group photos about junyi's research on magnetic biosensor array this research is aimed to improve the performance of the giant magnetoresistance gmr based magnetic biosensor array which detects the fringing fields of the magnetic nano particle mnp labels attaching to the sensor surface via biomolecules the gmr biosensors are promising for sensitive large scale inexpensive and portable biomolecular detection by utilizing both frequency division multiplexing fdm and time division multiplexing tdm our research group has already established the measurement system for biological diagnostics but the detection is limited by the high low frequency flicker noise and low signal caused by the mnps for the flicker noise with experiment results under different magnetic condition the effect of magnetic domain structures on flicker noise was studied also correlated double sampling technique was explored to reduce the highly correlated flicker noise for the signal caused by mnps fringing field both experiments and simulations will be performed to study the effect of spatial location of mnps over sv and mtj sensors and to provide theoretical support for further sensor design modification return to wang group home
