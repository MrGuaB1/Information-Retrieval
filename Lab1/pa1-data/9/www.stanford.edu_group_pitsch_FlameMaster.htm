pitsch group flamemaster flamemaster v3 3.10 a c++ computer program for 0d combustion and 1d laminar flame calculations developed by h pitsch the code is available to anyone who seriously wants to use it the documentation is very sparse but the package comes with many examples for homogeneous reactor or plug flow reactor steady counterflow diffusion flames with potential flow or plug flow boundary conditions freely propagating premixed flame steady flamelet equation unsteady flamelet equations changes from version 3.1 include an improved newton solver for 1d flame computations providing better convergence new sensitivity analysis for homogeneous reactor computations more documentation and more support for generating flamelet libraries changes from version 3.3 include a few bug fixes that should make installation easier changes from version 3.3 1 include a few bug fixes easier installation and support for windows based computers version 3.3 9 has two major new features first it attempts to compile with windows and it does if you do it right but the present installation instructions might be incomplete this will be updated soon second all fortran source code has been replaced by c code therefore a fortran compiler is no longer necessary for the installation version 3.3 10 fixes some issues with installation on different machines and adds the perfectly stirred reactor as a new configuration download package password required request access example above figure temperature from an unsteady flamelet calculation of auto ignition in a vw di diesel engine time given in degrees crank angle before tdc scalar dissipation rate distribution from kiva calculation figure taken from pitsch h barths h peters n three dimensional modeling of nox and soot formation in di diesel engines using detailed chemistry based on the interactive flamelet approach sae982057 home research people publications downloads sponsors contact the webmaster last updated january 19 2007
