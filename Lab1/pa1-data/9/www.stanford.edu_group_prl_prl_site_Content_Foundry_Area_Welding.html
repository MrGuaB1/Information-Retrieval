welding room welding room the welding sheet metal facilities are combined in a single room students use this room for a variety of welding processes from fine jewelry brazing to tig welding the sheet metal equipment is capable of cutting 060 thick steel sheet metal and 1 aluminum sheet please use the links below to learn more about the equipment and processes supported in the welding room welding tig welding tig welding is good for making very fine precise welds primarily in aluminum and steel mig welding mig welding is basically the metal equivalent of a hot glue gun a little messy but fast effective oxyacetylene welding oxyacetylene welding is unshielded by inert gases so it can warp your materials but it's easy to learn brazing brazing allows you to glue two metals together using another metal of a lower melting point as the adhesive sheet metal tube forming equipment press brake power shear slip roll ring roller turret punch materials aluminum brass copper steel stainless steel solders are you brazing you probably want to read this titanium tools and misc equipment hydraulic press it's pretty strong
