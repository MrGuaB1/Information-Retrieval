the paul f glenn laboratories for the biology of aging at stanford university home contact research people programs in the news events winter and spring 2012 frontiers in aging seminar series people director thomas a rando md phd the rando laboratory studies the basic molecular mechanisms of stem cell biology including the regulation of quiescence activation proliferative expansion and progenitor cell fate a major focus of the research is on age related declines of stem cell mediated tissue homeostasis repair and regeneration and on the role of the systemic environment of aged organisms in suppressing stem cell functionality in this context the laboratory focuses on the biology of muscle stem cells and comparisons with adult stem cells in other tissues the rando laboratory also studies both pathogenesis and experimental therapeutics for the muscular dystrophies with a particular emphasis on stem cell therapies http med stanford edu profiles thomas_rando http www stanford edu casco associate directors steven e artandi md phd the artandi laboratory is interested in how telomere shortening influences cancer stem cell function and aging telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that protect chromosome ends and shorten with cell division and aging the artandi laboratory has found that telomerase the reverse transcriptase that synthesizes telomere repeats also regulates stem cells the artandi laboratory is pursuing the function of telomerase through diverse genetic and biochemical approaches http med stanford edu profiles steven_artandi http www stanford edu group artandi anne brunet phd the brunet laboratory studies the molecular basis of longevity the brunet laboratory is interested in the mechanism of action of known longevity genes including foxo transcription factors and sirt deacetylases the brunet lab focuses on the role of these longevity genes in the mammalian nervous system particularly in aging neural stem cells the brunet laboratory is also discovering novel genes and processes involved in aging using two model systems the invertebrate c elegans and an extremely short lived vertebrate the african killifish n furzeri http med stanford edu profiles anne_brunet http www stanford edu group brunet home contact research people programs in the news
