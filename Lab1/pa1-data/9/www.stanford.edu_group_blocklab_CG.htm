cuauhtemoc garcia garcia cuauhtemoc garcia garcia bs unam ph d the johns hopkins university i am currently studying translational control of human gene regulation specifically my work is on how the human ribosome moves along the untranslated region of the mrna preceding genes a process termed scanning to date optical traps are the only experimental technique that allows direct visualization of this phenomenon the overall goal of this project is to mechanistically and energetically characterize ribosome scanning including its dependence on the mrna energy landscape and the effects of phosphorylation of different initiation factors in the scanning complex my bs is in physics from universidad nacional autonoma de mexico and i did my undergraduate thesis on chaotic transport in deterministic ratchets under the supervision of jose luis mateos thereafter i did graduate work in the program of molecular biophysics at johns hopkins university where i obtained my ph d working for david draper my doctoral work focused on the experimental validation of the poisson boltzmann formalism in describing electrostatic components of binding and folding of rna protein complexes after completing my ph d i started my postdoctoral work at uc berkeley there in collaboration with christopher fraser we initiated a project to address the mechanism of ribosome scanning which has morphed into my current project of using optical traps in the steven block lab at stanford beyond academia i am interested in german politics and society of the last two centuries and german grammar of course prior to the rechtschreibreform of 1996 i also love to alpine climb including rock snow and of course ice
