videos home imaging videos fly by over 2mmx2mm afm image 2mb this mpeg shows the magnitude of information that can be collected with 10 parallel probes there were 25 million pixels collected in one pass 2mm long with each of 10 probes responsible for a 200um wide section the pixels were only spaced 400nm apart to conserve computer resources 40 billion pixels would describe this area at the reasonable afm image spacing of 50nm increasing the throughput of the atomic force microscope 16mb this mpeg which includes an audio track explaining the footage highlights the devlopments in high speed large area scanning probe microscopy high speed atomic force microscopy 6mb this mpeg shows highspeed imaging footage with both optical lever and piezoresistive sensing integrated actuator for force feedback afm cantilever demonstration front view 1mb this mpeg shows a computer model of the zno scanning probe which has an integrated sensor and actuator the movie shows how the sensor region is deflected when it passes over topography but then relieved of this deflection force by the actuator region which moves in order to keep a constant force between the tip and sample integrated actuator for force feedback afm cantilever demonstration side view 0.5 mb this mpeg shows a side view of the one above lithography videos micromachining videos increasing the throughput of the atomic force microscope 16mb this mpeg which includes an audio track explaining the footage highlights the devlopments in high speed large area scanning probe microscopy other videos two dimensional bimorph arrays for imaging thermal radiation 10mb two dimensional silicon metal bimorph arrays have been used to transform thermal radiation into mechanical motion that can be detected with visible radiation this mpeg shows illustrations of the bimorph arrays and actual footage of their use home micromachining imaging lithography biosensors other work questions comments mail quatewebmaster
