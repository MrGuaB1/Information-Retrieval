the following pictures show the diversity of youth in the egyptian culture the following pictures portray the wauys of transportation in the egyptian culture a very common scene is shown in this first picture where a donkey walks in the middle of the streets beside the cars as a sort of transportation carrying either people or vegetables and fruits it is actually interesting that even people who do not have money do their best to be capable of continuing their jobs this is called a hantour in egyptian and on its sides you can find taxi cab written the hantour is used in the poor or really old areas in egypt the most popular taxies are the black white taxies it is the taxi that most of the population uses if they do not have cars or don t use public buses these black white taxies are a whole other story the drivers usually talk about politics and society with the passenger they have and when they reach the destination a big argument has to occur for the driver to take more money than what the passenger offers on the other hand the following picture shows a very clean taxi cab that is called cairo cab or city cab that people from the middle or the upper class use for transportation si nce it costs way more expensive than the hantour and the normal black white taxi it is air conditioned it's clean and the also mechanically fully functioning finally all these ways of transportation stand and wait with the other massive amount of cars in the traffic flow that happens every single day as shown in the next picture
