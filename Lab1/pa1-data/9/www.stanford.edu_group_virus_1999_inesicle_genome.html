herpesvirus genome herpesvirus genome important properties linear double stranded dna monopartite dna wrapped around a fibrillar spool which makes up the core a unique feature reiterated dna sequences i at the ends ii some herpesviruses have internal repeats which divide the genome into unique short us and unique long ul sequences iii these repeats can invert to give rise to up to four different isomers of a genome which present in equimolar proportions another unique feature herpesviruses themselves encode most of the enzymes that they require to replicate viral dna scientists hypothesize that this allows the virus to replicate in slowly dividing or non dividing cells such as neurons eg for hsv about 50 of its 73 genes are not critical for viral replication in vitro the other genes may encode regulatory proteins and virokines to help with in vivo pathogenesis size of genomes hsv type 1 and type2 152 kilobases vzv 125 kb ebv 172 kb cmv 229 kb hhv 6 162 kb comments created march 4 1999 last modified march 4 1999
