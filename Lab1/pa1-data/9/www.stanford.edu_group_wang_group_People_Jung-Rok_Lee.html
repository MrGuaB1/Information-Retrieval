jung rok lee stanford center for magnetic nanotechnology the wang group about jung rok's research on magneto nanosensors magnetic immunoassay mia is a novel type of diagnostic immunoassay using magnetic beads our magneto nanosensors utilize the giant magnetoresistance gmr effect to detect the presence of biological analyte labeled with magnetic beads the magneto nanosensors have very low detection limit of analytes because the biological samples naturally lack any detectable magnetic content providing a sensing platform with a very low background level with this feature detection of proteins with femtomolar concentrations has been demonstrated using the magneto nanosensors using these magneto nanosensors the tumor and host responses in mouse models have been studied by monitoring concentrations of cytokines in the serum samples over time the magneto nanosensors can be also used to find the biomarkers for a certain disease and to monitor cellular responses to antigen challenges or drug treatments education bs seoul national university ms stanford university e mail jungrok stanford dot edu jung rok lee home projects publications people news group photos jung rok lee was admitted into the ph d program in 2010 he is co advised by professor juan g santiago mechanical engineering and professor shan x wang materials science and engineering return to wang group home
