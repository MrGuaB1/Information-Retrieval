how to publicize events email email is by far the best way to reach people it is cheap easy and comprehensive most effective is the gsc weekly mass email that goes to 85 of the grad population including off campus students this list is a compilation of departmental mailing lists some people slip through the cracks but this is the most comprehensive list we have access to the upper echelons have ways of emailing 100 of the grad population so maybe someday if the gsc list fails the ca's have similarly comprehensive lists of those in grad housing department lists can also be used as well as group lists like icenter social emails should be written carefully to ensure correctness & completeness make sure that emails conform to the purposes of lists that they are sent to & be very sparing w email volume listowners can give us a hard time & or deny access if we are sloppy the gsc keeps an archive of its mass emails on its web page gsc stanford edu examples of ads for past events can be seen there web events can be posted on calendus stanford edu this is easy but not very well read yet posters posters are a more concrete form of publicity and can be more artistic but they are a lot of work and it is hard to get good coverage because the grad population is geographically diffuse the assu ad agency can be hired to hang or even design posters but they are somewhat expensive and unreliable they distribute twice a week & they have deadlines ad agency arrangements should be made through the gsc to get the best rates it can be valuable to have posters near an event site so the locals know what's coming gsc newsletter the gsc publishes a quarterly newsletter that is mailed to all grad students & is quite comprehensive but not very timely
