a brief introduction to the regal world of coronaviridae coronavirus with their spiky glycoproteins courtesy of the voyeuristic cdc classification and taxonomy the name coronaviridae comes from the latin corona meaning crown the virus has glycoprotein spikes on it's surface which gives it the look of wearing a crown both mark and melanie have always been very confused by this analogy when we see a crown we thinks of something like this certainly this crown does not look like our most favorite virus albeit it is highly regal in nature it's from russia thanks to the miracle of google search we were able to enlighten ourselves by finding a picture of this wow looks much better this picture makes it clear that when referring to a crown we refer to the glycoprotein spikes which stick out rather than assorted jewelry that is stuck to the crown mark now associates jewelry with viral proteins which is rather disturbing structure genome single stranded rna positive sense non segmented linear large genome that is 32 kilobases and 25000 33000 nucleotides long genome has 5 cap and 3 polyadenylated tail 4 major structural proteins 1 nucleocapsid n protein 2 membrane m glycoprotein 3 spike s glycoprotein 4 envelope e protein group 2 coronaviruses also have a hemagglutinin esterase he glycoprotein virion enveloped virion helical nucleocapsid pleomorphic 80 160 nm spherical with glycoprotein spikes cornonaviruses that infect humans genus coronavirus human coronavirus hcov hcov 229e hcov oc43 sars cov hcov nl63 cov hku1 human enteric corona virus hecv genus torovirus human torovirus pathogenesis involved mainly with respiratory tract illness but are also involved in enteric and central nervous system diseases they are represented by 2 prototype strains hcov 229e and hcov oc43 which belong to antigenic groups 1 and 2 respectively
