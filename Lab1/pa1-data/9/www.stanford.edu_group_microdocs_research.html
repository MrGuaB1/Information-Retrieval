microdocs research global warming lab coral & ubiquitin lab to the reef adapting to the heat ground truthing protecting reefs marine parks mpa home solutions around the world research research coral reef sustainability relies on many complex interactions within this ecosystem connections between coral reefs and other ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrass meadows are also essential for the health of all the ecosystems involved understanding these interactions and what happens when they are disrupted is important in preserving this ecosystem the microdocs below and in the sea is green show some of this research in action ground truthing scuba diving to test satellites a natural global warming lab coral in a small america samoan lagoon are thriving in hot water that would kill other coral how can they stand the heat coral and ubiquitin a tiny protein might help save corals from global warming bringing the lab to the reef what can an interconnected system of pipes pumps generators and a really long extension cord tell us about global warming adapting to the heat two water tanks on a beach may tell us if coral can survive a warming ocean see marinebio org for a list of marine research institutions all content property of microdocs project last updated january 5 2012
