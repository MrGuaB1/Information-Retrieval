biotemplating group home biotemplating of 2d & 3d nanostructures home members news links research into protein self assembly and biotemplating into 2d and 3d conducting nanostructures is a new collaborative multi disciplinary project involving four research groups at stanford university by combining expertise in protein engineering molecular characterization theoretical biophysics and inorganic organic interactions we aim to develop a flexible platform capable of self assembling into a variety of 2d and 3d ordered structures this level of precision is desirable in a variety of applications and could open the door to fundamentally new designs for bio inorganic devices and templating applications this project is funded through the materials science and engineering division of the department of energy's office of basic energy sciences our work also contributes to a larger effort at the stanford linear accelerator center slac called the stanford institute for materials & energy science simes as part of the carbon based and biomimetic hybrid materials research group the doniach group the heilshorn group development of x ray scattering technologies to perform in situ measurements of heirarchical protein assemblies protein engineering approaches to creating biotemplates that will readily assemble into nanostructures and easily interface with inorganics the melosh group the spakowitz group study of mechanical properties of protein assemblies and development of biotemplating and device integration techniques theoretical and computational modeling of protein assembly systems to explore the self assembly process and predict properties of protein networks updated 3 10
