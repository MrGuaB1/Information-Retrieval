ca1 triggers the trace page 1 according to a popular theory memories are encoded and tempo rarily stored in the hippocampus and eventually transferred to the cortex indeed many lesion studies suggest that the hippocampus is not involved in the retrieval of remote memories however goshen et al now show using optogenetic inactivation of hippocampal ca1 neurons that the hippocampus has a role in recall of remote memory but that in the absence of ca1 activation memories can be retrieved through direct acti vation of neocortical areas the authors optogenetically inactivated glutamatergic excita tory ca1 neurons in mice during a contextual fear conditioning test a hippocampus dependent memory task silencing of these neurons either during fear condi tioning or during a recall test 24 h later prevented retrieval of the fear memory which is expressed as fear behaviour indicating that ca1 neu rons are involved in the formation and recall of recent contextual fear memory surprisingly inactivation of ca1 neurons during remote recall up to 12 weeks after fear conditioning also blocked retrieval of the fear memory this effect was reversible as fear memory was restored when the animals were tested the next day without inactivation of ca1 neurons strikingly mice that were tested 5 weeks after training initially showed normal memory retrieval but when ca1 neurons were inacti vated halfway through the recall test fear behaviour disappeared these data suggest that the hippocampus is persistently involved in memory retrieval in previous studies genetic phar macological or physical lesions of the hippocampus had been performed minutes to weeks before fear memory testing and had been found to affect recent memory but not remote memory to allow a better compari son with earlier studies the authors extended optogenetic inactivation from 30 min before to the end of the recall test consistent with findings from lesion studies such prolonged inactivation of ca1 neurons blocked retrieval of recent but not remote fear memory studies of fos expression a measure of neuronal activation suggested that ca1 activation during recall may recruit the anterior cingu late cortex acc accordingly both real time and prolonged optogenetic inactivation of acc neurons during recall impaired remote memory but had no effect on recent memory recall these findings indicate that long term memory retrieval normally involves the hippocampus possibly as a default activator of the memory trace in neocortical areas however this system seems to be flexible in that the memory can also be retrieved directly from the neocortex leonie welberg original research paper goshen i et al dynamics of retrieval strategies for remote memories cell 147 678 689 2011 learning and memory ca1 triggers the trace research highlights nature reviews neuroscience volume 12 december 2011 nature reviews neuroscience aop published online 9 november 2011 doi 10.1038 nrn3144 2011 macmillan publishers limited all rights reserved
