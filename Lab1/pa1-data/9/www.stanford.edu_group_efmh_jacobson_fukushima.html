fukushima html upper limit of worldwide modeled transport of radiation from the fukushima dai ichi nuclear plant computer simulation starting 12 gmt march 12 2011 of the transport of cesium 137 as particulate matter from the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant in japan the simulation accounted for size resolved emissions of cesium horizontal and vertical transport of aerosol particles containing cesium cloud drop and ice crystal activation of aerosol particles containing cesium coagulation of aerosol particles containing cesium with cloud drops ice crystals and graupel tracking of cesium in hydrometeor particles from entry to precipitation aerosol aerosol coagulation aerosol sedimentation aerosol dry deposition condensational and dissolutional growth evaporation of aerosol particles containing cesium and internal aerosol chemistry and hydration of aerosol particles containing cesium the simulations were performed with the gator gcmom computer model graphics were prepared by john ten hoeve contact mark z jacobson if you cannot view the video in your browser you can download the videos directly instead here return to mark jacobson's home page
