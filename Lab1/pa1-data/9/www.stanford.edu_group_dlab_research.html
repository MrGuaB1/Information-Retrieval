deisseroth lab stanford university karl deisseroth research group members publications resources news life in d lab directions internal site research areas in our group at stanford we have developed optical neuroengineering technologies for noninvasive imaging and control of brain circuits as they operate within living intact tissue in real time we are employing and further developing these tools to probe neural circuit dynamics with millisecond temporal resolution we hope that outcomes of this work will include fundamental new conceptualizations of neurological and psychiatric disorders basic neuroscience and bioengineering insights and potent specific circuit modulation interventions for treatment of disease our laboratory is based in the james h clark center at stanford and employs a wide range of techniques including neural stem cell and tissue engineering methods electrophysiology molecular biology neural activity imaging animal behavior and computational neural network modeling i am also a physician in the psychiatry department where i employ novel interventional high speed action potential based brain stimulation techniques in human patients for therapeutic purposes deisseroth lab stanford university 318 campus drive west clark center w080 stanford california 94305
