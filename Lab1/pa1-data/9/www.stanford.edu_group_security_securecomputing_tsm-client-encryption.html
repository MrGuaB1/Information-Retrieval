tsm backup client encryption stanford university secure computing information security office secure computing tsm backup client encryption tsm backup client encryption security guidelines if you store or process restricted data you need to make sure this data is encrypted when it is backed up this document explains how to configure the tsm clients to encrypt their backup traffic please contact the storage team before making these changes to avoid problems the recommended versions of tsm client tsm 5.5 x or later server tsm 5.5 x or later tsm client encryption setup set up client options dsm sys for unix linix macos and dsm opt for all others encryptkey save encryptiontype type type aes128 or des56 there is an encryptkey generate setting but the storage group does not recommend using this since this is a relatively new function and it is unknown if it has any issues the include exclude list will determine what is to be encrypted and their retention in this example all files will be encrypted and bound with management class named mgmtclass management classes are the retention policies defined on the tsm server and will have a unique name the default management class is used if nothing is stated in the include option if it is unclear what management class is to be used here then please contact the storage group for assistance before proceeding these are placed in the dsm sys for unix linix macos and dsm opt for all others or an include exclude file for all platforms this option will be in the form include encrypt filespec for example for backup include backup mgmtclass include encrypt then all files will be encrypted and bound with mgmtclass called mgmtclass mgmtclass are the retention policies defined on the tsm server the default mgmtclass is used if nothing is stated in the include option if compression is also needed then this may futher slow down the backup process include backup mgmtclass include encrypt include compression compression yes compressalways no the include exclude can be defined at the file level and is bottom up processing if archives are also done for this system then include archive statements are also needed to encrypted archives once setup is complete run backup of one file for the encryption key to be prompted and saved encryption key can be up to 63 bytes in length with the following characters character description az any letter a through z upper or lower case 09 any number 0 through 9 plus period _ underscore hyphen & ampersand when the encryption has been tested and verifed then start the tsm scheduler if you want to verify the encryption key set encryptkey prompt and then restore and or restore to another system with encryptkey prompt please note if the encryption keys are lost the data will not be recoverable even though the tsm pwd file will save the encryption key it is recommend that these key are also saved in at a different location windows system saves the key and password in the registry if you use multiple keys then this can slow down restore the way incremental backups are done in tsm depending on how much data is to be encrypted this may put a heavy load on the system during backups if there is already data backed up this process only encrypts future backups it is strongly recommended that you contact the storage group with any questions before you start need more information contact the storage group if you have any addtional questions about the storage or backup service su storage lists stanford edu http www stanford edu services storage external resources http publib boulder ibm com infocenter tivihelp v1r1 index jsp topic com ibm itsmfdt doc ans50000108 htm http publib boulder ibm com infocenter tivihelp v1r1 index jsp topic com ibm itsmfdt doc ans50000287 htm http publib boulder ibm com infocenter tivihelp v1r1 index jsp topic com ibm itsmfdt doc ans50000313 htm http publib boulder ibm com infocenter tivihelp v1r1 index jsp topic com ibm itsmfdt doc ans50000288 htm last modified pk wednesday 27 jan 2010 12 27 48 pm information security office computing and communication computing self help helpsu stanford university all rights reserved stanford ca 94305 650 723 2300 terms of use copyright complaints
