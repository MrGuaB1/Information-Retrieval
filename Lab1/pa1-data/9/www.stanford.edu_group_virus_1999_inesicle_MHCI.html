herpesviruses and immune evasion herpesviruses and mechanisms of immune evasion a unique phenomenon that is being researched in herpesviruses is their ability to evade the immune system through various mechanisms one particular method is via down regulation of the cell surface expression of the major histocompatibility complex class i mhc i which is found on most cells in the body mhc i molecules associate with viral in this case antigens found in the cytosol and present them to cd8 t cells because my honors thesis in biology is on mhc i downregulation of one herpesvirus i just want to share the varying mechanisms used by different herpesviruses to evade this crucial arm of the immune response virus protein mechanism hsv icp47 competes with peptide binding on tap complex hcmv pp65 phosphorylates immediate early proteins to prevent processing by the proteasome hcmv us6 binds to tap complex from er lumenal side hcmv us11 exports heavy chain to cytosol hcmv us2 degrades heavy chain hcmv us3 retains mhc i in er ebv ebna 1 interferes with proteosomal proteolysis references fruh k k ahn and pa peterson inhibition of mhc class i antigen presentation by viral proteins j mol med 1997 75 18 27 ploegh hidde l viral strategies of immune evasion science 1998 280 248 253
