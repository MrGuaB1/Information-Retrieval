viral integrase stanford university medical center dept of molecular pharmacology dept of microbiology & immunology nolan lab 12 viral integrase and biochemistry of dna cleavage ligation retroviruses are the only animal viruses that integrate into the host cell's genome during the normal growth cycle they utilize an integrase in encoded by the pol gene that acts in a site specific manner to join the ends of the viral cdna to quasi random target sequences in host cell dna the linear ds cdna made in the cytoplasm is transported to the nucleus where it is also found as circles and as integrated dna two forms of circular dna are generally found one having a single ltr and one having two ltrs however it is now generally accepted that the proximal precursor to the integrated provirus is the linear molecule with two ltrs related links home page interests members mta forms plasmid maps retroviral systems genetic screens library systems protocols tutorials publications contact virus chat
