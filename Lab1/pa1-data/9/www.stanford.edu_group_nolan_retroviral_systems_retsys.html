retroviral systems stanford university medical center dept of molecular pharmacology dept of microbiology & immunology nolan lab retroviral systems retroviruses are an efficient means to deliver single dna expression constructs to a wide range of mammalian cell types they are by far the easiest and fastest means to deliver genes stably to mammalian cells they have an additional advantage in that systems developed in the nolan laboratory have allowed for their application to deliver large libraries of genes or peptides or frankly any dna encoded objects to target cells phoenix mmulv vectors phoenix the first termed phoenix is currently employed in over 2500 laboratories worldwide for delivery of genes and libraries to cells for biomedical research it is based on moloney murine leukemia virus mmulv and allows for delivery of genes to most dividing mammalian cell types the system comes as either an ecotropic packaging system capable of delivering genes to dividing murine or rat cells or an amphotropic system capable of delivering genes to dividing cells of most mammalian species including human a variant of the system contains simply the gag pol genes and allows for pseudotyping with alternative envelope proteins such as vsv g felix fiv lentivirus vectors felix fiv the second system felix is based on feline immunodeficiency virus and allows for delivery of genes to most dividing and nondividing mammalian cell types the felix vector system is derived from feline immunodeficiency virus fiv fiv is a member of the lentivirus subfamily of retroviruses and causes an immunodeficiency syndrome in cats which closely resembles that caused by hiv in humans helix hiv lentivirus vectors helix hiv the third system is the hiv 1 based packaging systems helix which allows for delivery of genes to most dividing and nondividing mammalian cell types these vectors are derived from human immunodeficiency virus related links library systems using phoenix tutorials on retroviruses for gene delivery download material transfer agreements for phoenix lines mtas for felix mtas for helix mtas home page interests members mta forms plasmid maps retroviral systems genetic screens library systems protocols tutorials publications contact virus chat
