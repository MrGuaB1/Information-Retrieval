electricity and magnetism worksheet key part 3 page 1 electricity and magnetism worksheet key part 3 name ______________________________ 1 which end of your nail points to the north head or point circle one this answer will be different for each group because it depends on the orientation of the magnet with respect to the nail 2 what happened to the compass needle when a current is allowed to flow in the wire the needle is deflected moves when the current is allowed to flow 3 insert one end of the iron wire into the straw with coil what happens when a current is allowed to flow in the wire the iron wire is drawn into the straw inside the coil when the current is allowed to flow 4 how many paper clips can you pick up with your electromagnet ___________ 5 draw what happens to your needle when you place the nail with the coil next to it and let the current flow side view depending on which end is n and s the needle will align parallel or anti parallel to the energized coil when the battery polarity is switched the needle will change its orientation by 180 electricity and magnetism part 3 page 1 page 2 top view again depending on which end is n and s the needle will align parallel or anti parallel to the energized coil when the battery polarity is switched the needle will change its orientation by 180 how would you mark n and s on the nail with the coil this answer will depend on which end of the needle was determined to be the north pole as the current is applied and the needle aligns with the nail in the coil the n end of the coil nail can be identified this pole will switch when the battery polarity is switched underline the correct answer in the sentence below the direction of the magnetic field changes does not change when the battery connections are reversed electricity and magnetism part 3 page 2
