matt gordon matt gordon ab 1998 princeton ph d 2006 university of illinois at urbana champaign i am originally from chicago il i received my ab in physics from princeton 1998 where i did my undergraduate thesis work with bob austin on the fluid mechanics of ultra rapid mixers after a brief stint in the software industry geodesic systems chicago il during the heady 90's i pursued my graduate studies at the university of illinois at urbana champaign where i worked with paul selvin on applications of single molecule fluorescence localization to problems in molecular motors and genomics i received my ph d in physics in 2006 and joined the block lab in september of 2006 i am tremendously interested in developing and applying new technologies for detecting tracking and manipulating single molecules and hope to be able to apply my knowledge of fluorescence and instrumentation to these pursuits in the block lab personally i am an avid singer a fencer and a biker and hope to get back into rock climbing now that i am living in a state with a non trivial standard deviation along the z axis i also maintain a blog covering recent science and news in the single molecule field at http insingulo blogspot com
