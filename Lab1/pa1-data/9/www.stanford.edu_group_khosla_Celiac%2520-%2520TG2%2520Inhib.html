celiac tg2 inhib the transglutaminase family of enzymes is best known for crosslinking proteins to form networks that strengthen tissues one member of this family transglutaminase 2 tg2 is the primary autoantigen in celiac sprue tg2 is also implicated in a variety of other diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases type 2 diabetes and certain cancers including glioblastoma multiforme we are studying both fundamental aspects of tg2 as well as practical aspects of inhibiting the enzyme although this enzyme family has been extensively studied a detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism has been hampered by the lack of a structure in which the enzyme is in a configuration compatible with its activity we have solved at 2 a resolution the structure of tg2 in complex with a molecule that mimics a celiac sprue related substrate the structure exposes the active site giving direct insights into its catalytic mechanism unexpectedly we observed a very large conformational change with respect to previous transglutaminase structures very few proteins have been observed to undergo this type of large scale transformation we believe that this structural rearrangement may play a role in the pathogenesis of celiac sprue besides the fundamental implications our results should allow for the rational design of better inhibitors of tg2 for pharmacological and therapeutic purposes active site of tg2 in inhibitor bound structure contact info useful links publications people professor khosla research interests home pinkas dm strop p bunger at khosla c 2007 transglutaminase 2 undergoes a large conformational change upon activation plos biology 2007 5 12 e327
