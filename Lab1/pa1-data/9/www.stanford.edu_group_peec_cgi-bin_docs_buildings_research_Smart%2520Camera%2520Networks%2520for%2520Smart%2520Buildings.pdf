smart camera networks for smart buildings page 1 smart cameras provide more security than surveillance cameras all image processing occurs within a single device images are not streamed across the network visual data is deleted immediately after processing occupancy sensing definition smart camera networks for smart buildings itai katz hamid aghajan wireless sensor networks lab wireless sensor networks lab stanford university smart camera networks definition occupancy sensing applications applied smart camera networks privacy issues occupancy sensing is useful in determining trends in the motion of building occupants building utilization studies real time building actuation dynamically modified hvac lighting etc based on occupant positions emergency response automatically generated room manifests smart cameras pair a small camera with a low power embedded computer smart cameras convert images into parameters distributed algorithms combine parameters into a single interpretation the result is logged or submitted for additional processing camera networks have a number of advantages over more traditional building sensors richer behaviors can be described than with single purpose sensors smart cameras can be repurposed for different applications with minimal installation effort requires no physical token to be carried by the user for localization battery backed smart cameras could continue to operate with loss of power during civil disasters occupancy sensing considers two measurements counting people entering or exiting a building counting and localizing occupants in each space 3 2 4 visual numerical
