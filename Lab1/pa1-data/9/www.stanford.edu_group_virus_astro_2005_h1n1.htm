description negative sense single stranded rna enveloped 8 segments power very powerful so deadly that it resulted in over 50 million deaths around the world in 1918 the key to this virus's power lies in the fact that it underwent antigenic shift every once in a while genomic segments from one strain of influenza a virus combine with genomic segments from another strain and form a new strain that no one has ever been exposed to this new strain will have a different neurominidase and hemagglutinin combination than the other circulating forms of influenza a virus in the case of influenza a h1n1 virus the hemagglutinin 1 and neurominidase 1 combination was especially deadly when it first arose in the winter of 1918 some would even say that this little guy had the power to defeat the world's most powerful armies offenses antigenic drift occurs with every epidemic of influenza a so that immunity developed to one infection does not necessarily confer immunity to all infections of the same strain however if someone survives infection with h1n1 and subsequently gets re infected that person will experience much less severe symptoms than if it were their first infection defenses using predictions based on the type of virus that occurred in late infections of the previous epidemic scientists are able develop a vaccine for the next seasonal outbreak the current vaccines contain three influenza viruses representing one of the three groups of viruses circulating among people one of the strains is influenza a h1n1 and the other two are a h3n2 and an influenza b strategy infect humans during the autumn winter months when they are most likely to get infected if you feel like killing the opponent make sure to target young children and the elderly to be even more deadly try recruiting your bacterial friend streptococcus pneumoniae influenza a h1n1 virus family orthomyxoviridae
