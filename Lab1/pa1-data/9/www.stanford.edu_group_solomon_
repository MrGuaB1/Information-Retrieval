solomon laboratory professor solomon bioinorganic chemistry physical inorganic chemistry inorganic spectroscopy theoretical inorganic chemistry chemistry department stanford university contact the solomon lab uses both experimental and theoretical techniques to define the electronic and geometric structures of biologically and catalytically relevant transition metal sites our goal is to use our understanding of electronic structure to obtain a detailed understanding of reactivity and function our research utilizes a wide range of spectroscopic theoretical and chemical techniques to probe structure function relationships gain mechanistic insight and address fundamental questions of relevance to chemistry and biology the bioinorganic systems we study can be divided into five general areas electron transfer sites copper active sites in biology mononuclear non heme iron enzymes structure function correlation binuclear non heme iron enzymes dioxygen binding and activation zeolites stanford university chemistry department updated dec 2011
