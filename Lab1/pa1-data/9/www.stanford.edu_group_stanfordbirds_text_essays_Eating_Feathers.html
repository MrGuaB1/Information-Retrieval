eating feathers eating feathers perhaps because the idea of swallowing hair is so unpleasant to us it is difficult to believe the stories of birds deliberately eating their feathers nonetheless some do and they do so regularly grebes for example consume their feathers by the hundreds feathers taken from parents are found in the stomachs of chicks only a few days old fifty percent of the stomach contents of a horned or pied billed grebe may be feathers this odd behavior seems to have a purpose the action of the gizzard in these primarily fish eating birds is insufficient to crush the bones that are swallowed the feather balls are thought to protect the stomach by padding the sharp fish bones and slowing down the process of digestion so that the bones dissolve rather than pass into the intestine this notion is supported by the observation that the least grebe which of all the grebes consumes the fewest fish also accumulates the smallest feather ball comparative studies of the gizzards and digestive physiology of fish eating birds are needed to test this hypothesis if it is supported the question will then be why grebes have not evolved digestive tracts that can function efficiently without being stuffed with feathers see feathered nests copyright 1988 by paul r ehrlich david s dobkin and darryl wheye
