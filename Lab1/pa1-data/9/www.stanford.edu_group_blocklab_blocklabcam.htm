the block lab optical trapping webcam block lab web cam what's under the microscope in herrin labs room 30f if you see two beads pictured below we re probably running rna polymerase experiments each of the two beads is held in an optical trap while a piece of dna is suspended between them the left bead is attached to the dna directly while the right bead is attached through the polymerase as the enzyme moves along the dna synthesizing rna the length of dna between the beads is shortened we monitor the enzyme's activity by watching the beads get closer together we can measure the length of dna between the beads by stretching it as we move the left bead with a steerable optical trap the dna becomes taught and starts to pull the right bead because we know the position and the force of the two optical traps we can infer the length of dna click here to watch a movie of dna stretching stretch2 avi 735 kb
