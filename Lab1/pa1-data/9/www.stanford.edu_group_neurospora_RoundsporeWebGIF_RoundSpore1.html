round spore in n crassa page 1 the perkins lab neurospora genetics and biology department of biological sciences stanford university ascus development in the round spore mutant of n crassa nb raju ascospores of neurospora crassa and those of various other heterothallic and homothallic neurospora species are normally ellipsoid similar to the american football in 1966 mary mitchell isolated a mutant with ascospores that are round rather than ellipsoid a similar round spore mutant was reported in n tetrasperma novak and srb 1973 the dominant n crassaround spore mutant r is altered in three ways abnormal vegetative morphology female sterility and ascospore shape the round ascospore phenotype is ascus dominant meaning that in crosses of wild type x r all eight ascospores are phenotypically round r as well as r+ figs 1 3 mitchell 1966 raju 1992 perkins et al 2001 in wild type x r early ascus development and meiosis are normal fig 4 postmeiotic mitosis occurs but the spindles at this division are aligned abnormally figs 5 6 following the third division all eight nuclei line up in single file and cut out eight round ascospores figs 7 10 another mitosis in the young ascospores makes them binucleate figs 11 15 during maturation 90 of round ascospores differentiate a single germ pore rather than the normal two in the ellipsoid wild type ascospores figs 16 17 in contrast the round ascospores of n tetrasperma mutant form two germ pores we have observed another abnormality during ascospore cutting in up to 5 of asci one or two ascospores show bud like vesicles figs 18 22 in the developing asci ascospore delimiting membranes are formed at the periphery of the ascus during interphase ii following a postmeiotic mitosis these membranes invaginate to sequester individual nuclei and the immediately surrounding cytoplasm into eight ascospores since eight round ascospores require less spore delimiting membrane than do eight ellipsoid ascospores there appears to be a surplus we interpret the ascospore buds in the round spored asci as being the unused wall membranes inclusions in the giant ascospores of the banana mutant can also be interpreted as unused remnants of wall forming membranes raju and newmeyer 1977 the round spore mutant has been extensively used in studies of suppression of dominant round spore phenotype by sad 1 and sad 2 mutants figs 23 24 shiu and metzenberg 2002 shiu et al 2001 return to the photos page to view other series of photographs for permission to use these photos and copyright information click here click on thumbnails to view enlarged photos with captions previous page 1 2 next fig 1 wt x r round spored asci fig 2 wt x r round spored asci fig 3 wt x r round spored asci fig 4 wt x r interphase ii fig 5 wt x r metaphase iii fig 6 wt x r telophase iii fig 7 wt x r spore cutting fig 8 wt x r spore cutting fig 9 wt x r young spores fig 10 wt x r young spores fig 11 wt x r metaphase iv fig 12 wt x r met iv tel iv permission and copyright you may use any of these photos for educational purposes not for profit we ask that you use a credit line citing the original reference and the photographer high resolution versions of these photos are available upon request from nb raju's photo collection see contacts if previously published photos are to be used in publication permission will of course be required from the publisher see the captions of enlarged photos perkins lab home department home university home contact us 2004 david d perkins
