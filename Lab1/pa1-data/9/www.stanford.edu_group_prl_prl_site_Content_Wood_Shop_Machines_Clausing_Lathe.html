clausing lathe clausing lathe the clausing lathe found in the model shop it's usually a little dusty but it still works just fine the clausing lathe is the lathe in the model shop that best mimics the functionality of the lathes in the machine shop but with a few key differences because of its location in the model shop the clausing lathe can only cut wood or plastic or modulan wax etc the pictures below will take you on a virtual tour of the clausing lathe's controls and you can compare contrast them to the controls on the victor lathes or leblonde lathes in the machine shop the power switch the trickiest thing about the clausing lathe sometimes can be getting the spindle to turn on and stay on the black and red buttons at the left side of the machine turn the machine on and off respectively to make sure that the machine actually turns on you may need to hold down the black button for upwards of 10 seconds while the spindle gets up to speed if you don t hold it long enough the spindle will immediately start slowing down as soon as you take your finger off the button shifting gears this lever changes the lathe from high gear to low gear inside the lathe if you re stuck in one gear grab the toothed gear the one on the right and shift it while you try to move the lever changing gears on the clausing lathe is less straightforward than it is on other lathes so ask if you have trouble if the lathe is in high gear the lever will be pointed up likewise if the lever is pointed down the lathe is in low gear to change gears pull the lever out towards you and gently but firmly shift the lever either up or down if it gets stuck and it often does open the top as shown in the photo below and jiggle the big gear the one with the teeth with your hand while you re shifting the lever speed control the speed control to change speeds within a gear crank the handle while the spindle is rotating like the mills in the machine shop you never want to touch this crank while the spindle is stationary half nut autofeed the half nut and autofeed levers the clausing lathe can also autofeed and chase threads most applications in the model shop don t require these operations but they are there if you need them they work exactly like the victor lathes and leblonde lathes in the machine shop so please reference those pages if you need a refresher in autofeeding or chasing threads tools tool holders aloris tool post this lathe uses aloris tool posts identical to the ones used in the machine shop by the victors and leblondes this means that it uses the same tool holders and tools that the machine shop lathes do as well for more information please see the lathe info page in the machine shop section of the site tailstock the clausing tailstock graced by a keyless chuck the tailstock is no different on the clausing lathe than it is on the victors or leblondes
