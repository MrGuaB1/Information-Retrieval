polyketides structure modular pkss are responsible for the biosynthesis of polyketide natural products with a variety of antibiotic antiviral immunosuppressant cholesterol lowering and anticancer activities the modular organization of these pkss makes them attractive targets for engineering designed to allow combinatorial biosynthesis of novel polyketide metabolites until now however the lack of detailed structural and mechanistic information for these megaenyzmes has greatly hampered progress in rational engineering of these modular polyketides with primary sequence alignments being the only effective tool for predicting the boundaries of the constituent functional domains our research has therefore focused on the structural and mechanistic analysis on the 6 deoxyerythronolide b synthase debs we have determined the crystal structures of ketosynthase acyltransferase didomains from module 3 and module 5 of debs our results open the door to future efforts to engineer useful polyketide products with important medicinal activities 2 4 contact info useful links publications people professor khosla research interests home tang y kim cy mathews ii cane de khosla c the 2.7 angstrom crystal structure of a 194 kda homodimeric fragment of the 6 deoxyerythronolide b synthase proc natl acad sci usa 2006 103 30 11124 9 tang y chen ay kim cy cane de khosla c structural and mechanistic analysis of protein interactions in module 3 of the 6 deoxyerythronolide b synthase chem biol 2007 14 8 931 43 alekseyev vy liu cw cane de puglisi jd khosla c solution structure and proposed domain domain recognition interface of an acyl carrier protein domain from a modular polyketide synthase protein science 2007
