professor roger t howe home biography publications research activities teaching research group students faqs teaching autumn quarter 2011 eng 40 is a first course in electronics for all students as such it is intended to provide a broader less thorough treatment than might be covered in a typical first course for just electrical engineers on the other hand more topics are covered to give a greater sense of the breadth capabilities and usefulness of electrical engineering in everyday life we begin by introducing some elementary dc circuit analysis and basic measuring devices we then introduce operational amplifiers as a class of very useful components for manipulating electrical signals next we introduce phasors frequency response and filtering we finish the quarter with a discussion of digital logic and a brief description of digital to analog and analog to digital converters hands on experience with many of the concepts and circuits that are discussed in lecture will be obtained in the three hour laboratory sessions each week in addition several labs this quarter will emphasize design techniques and strategies further enhancing the fundamental theory presented in the lectures prerequisite physics 43 ee412 with prof olav solgaard this project based course is focused on the development or characterization of processing methods used in the fabrication of devices in the stanford nanofabrication facility snf the snf is a shared use cleanroom providing micro and nano fabrication equipment and processing know how for a diverse range of research areas including chemistry earth science materials science & engineering life sciences medicine optics and physics as well as the more traditional fields of electronics photonics and n mems in this course students have the opportunity to choose among several available projects or to propose their own with the objective of gaining experience in the practical aspects of process development as well as contributing towards the snf's library of processing methods prerequisite completion of ee410 or eng 341 or consent of instructors winter quarter 2012 ee216 with prof krishna saraswat this core ee course introduces the circuit abstraction linear and non linear circuit elements and network theorems in addition it provides an introduction to mos digital and analog circuits the laboratory uses ac to dc converters to reinforce the concepts covered in lecture spring quarter 2012 eng 240 introduction to micro and nano electromechanical systems m nems miniaturization technologies now have important roles in materials mechanical and biomedical engineering practice in addition to being the foundation for information technology this course targets an audience of first year engineering graduate students and motivated senior level undergraduates with the goal of providing an introduction to m nems fabrication techniques selected device applications and the design tradeoffs in developing systems this course has no specific prerequisites other than graduate or senior standing in engineering otherwise students will require permission of the instructor ee412 with prof olav solgaard see above description
