research topological insulators research topological insulators topological insulators are a new state of matter topologically distinct from ordinary insulators they comprise surface states which cross the bulk semiconducting gap a consequence of band inversion due to spin orbit coupling the crossing is protected by a topological invariant and is robust to perturbations that do not break time reversal symmetry the resulting metallic surface is predicted to have interesting properties arising partly from the massless dirac spectrum and partly from the strong spin orbit coupling the general electronic structure of bulk and surface states in several prototypical topological insulators has been beautifully revealed by arpes as illustrated above for the case of bi2se3 from yulin chen at stanford our work in this field explores the properties of the surface states and their interaction with the bulk with a particular emphasis on revealing the signature of the surface state in transport measurements publications most recent widespread spin polarization effects in photoemission from topological insulators ambipolar field effect in the ternary topological insulator bi x sb 1 x 2 te 3 by composition tuning stm imaging of a bound state along a step on the surface of the topological insulator bi 2 te 3 rapid surface oxidation as a source of surface degradation factor for bi 2 se 3 single dirac cone topological surface state and unusual thermoelectric property of compounds from a new topological insulator family two dimensional surface state in the quantum limit of a topological insulator click for additional publications massive dirac fermion on the surface of a magnetically doped topological insulator bulk fermi surface coexistence with dirac surface state in bi 2 se 3 a comparison of photoemission and shubnikov de haas measurements stm imaging of electronic waves on the surface of bi 2 te 3 topologically protected surface states and hexagonal warping effects experimental realization of a three dimensional topological insulator bi 2 te 3 contacts james analytis scott riggs jiun haw chu ian fisher back to home page home fisher research group geballe laboratory for advanced materials dept of applied physics stanford university ca 94305 4045 last updated dec 31st 2011 tumblr stats
