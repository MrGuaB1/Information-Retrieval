promiscuity promiscuity some species of birds do not form pair bonds but instead consort only briefly for minutes or hours the male's investment in offspring is limited to sperm and the female raises the young alone male hummingbirds for instance court females for a short time mate and then resume their quest for other females males of many grouse species and some shorebirds display on leks mating grounds used each year to attract females that depart immediately after mating the males may subsequently mate with additional females such mating systems in which no pair bond is formed are termed promiscuous presumably promiscuous mating systems can evolve only where the advantage of the male remaining with the female to help in raising the young is negligible see monogamy polygyny cooperative breeding parental care copyright 1988 by paul r ehrlich david s dobkin and darryl wheye
