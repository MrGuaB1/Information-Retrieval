green hat group march 2007 archives green hat group february 2007 main march 06 2007 political speeches analysis last week's collaboration with sweden had a new and interesting dynamic during this dialogue only one of our usual four swedish partners could be there because she was the only one i think we four americans deliberately went out of our way to initiate discussion and at the same time give her plenty of space and time to contribute as well in a way it forced us to take responsibility of the structure of the conference this situation coupled with the analysis of political speeches really made this the best collaboration so far mari alex kareem and i were all shocked by johanna's vehement denouncement of bush's speech while on one hand we four had found it to be overall a pretty decent speech especially considering it was a bueech bush speech in katrina language d she conversely found it completely inadequate and inappropriate to her his patriotism was overwhelming she also felt that for someone who was leading a country into war he was far too somber however on this side of the globe the four of us thought that it was entirely necessary he seem completely serious and aware of the perils and pains america would face because so much of the country opposed the war he could not expect his audience to be cheering and pumped about beginning a war with regards to the swedish prime minister reinfeldt's speech johanna found it completely normal and acceptable but we did not we were appalled by his lack of pc ness and the way he did not even attempt to bridge the gap between his winning party and the losing party there was no mention expression of admiration for the other candidate that we have come to expect from american winners in fact we were shocked to learn that he had won by such a small margin considering how little attention he paid to the losing party posted by katrina li at 10 10 pm permalink comments 2 trackbacks 0
