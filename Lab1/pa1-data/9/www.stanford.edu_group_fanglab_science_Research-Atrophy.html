ubiquitin like proteins fang lab research proteolysis and muscle atrophy working towards a cure muscle wasting or muscle atrophy is progressive loss of muscle mass and occurs as a consequence of denervation injury and joint immobilization muscle atrophy is frequently associated with patients of muscular dystrophies as well as with cancer aids and other systemic diseases muscle atrophy primarily results from accelerated protein degradation in affected muscle cells due to a hyper activation of the ubiquitin proteasome system the murf1 protein was identified as an atrophy specific factor whose expression is up regulated in atrophying muscle inactivation of murf1 significantly reduces the degree of muscle atrophy in mice indicating a key role of murf1 in accelerating protein degradation in atrophying muscle we and others have previously shown that murf1 is a ubiquitin ligase our general interests in ubiquitin dependent proteolysis led us to investigate the biochemical pathway of the murf1 ligase in atrophying muscle we have reconstituted the murf1 mediated ubiquitination reaction and identified a physiological substrate for the murf1 ligase our current focus on this project is to identify additional substrates of the murf1 ligase to develop biochemical and cell based assays amendable to high throughput screens and to screen for small molecule inhibitors of the murf1 pathway our long term goal is to understand the molecular basis of atrophy associated with muscular dystrophies and other systematic diseases and to develop therapeutic interventions to prevent atrophy in muscular dystrophies back to main page
