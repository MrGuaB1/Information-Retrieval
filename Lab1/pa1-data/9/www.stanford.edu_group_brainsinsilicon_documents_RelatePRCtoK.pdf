relating coupling strength k to the prc page 1 relating coupling strength k to the prc t the kuramoto model's sinusoidal phase coupling corresponds to a prc that is a flipped sinusoid to obtain the kuramoto model's coupling strength k we must multiply the prc's maximum advance delay tmax by the network's total spike rate consider only the jth oscillator's effect on the ith oscillator  i k n sin j i if the ith oscillator's phase is when the jth oscillator's phase is 0 which by definition is when it spikes then we have i j or j i this assumes that the phase difference remains constant throughout that cycle in which case the total change in the ith oscillator's phase over the complete cycle which by definition is the prc will be 2  prc t 0 t  i t 0 t k n sin t t k n sin where the prc is in seconds while the phase is in radians thus the 2  t conversion factor hence the kuramoto model's prc is a flipped sinusoid the prc's maximum delay advance tmax is related to the coupling strength k by 2  tmax t t k n k n 2  t tmax t in the presence of inhibition g the epression we obtained for tmax in lab 4 phase response can be rewritten as tmax m ai rr th where rth 2 3 1 g 3 2 and the expression we gave for the neuron's spike rate in lab 2 a spiking neuron can be rewritten as 1 t 37 6 2  m rr th 2 3 1 rr th 37 6 t 2  m 3 2 hence we can express tmax as tmax m ai 37 6 t 2  m 3 2 t 2  3 2 37 4 m ai substituting this expression into our expression for k above yields page 2 k 2  n 1 t2 t 2  3 2 37 4 m ai 37 4 n 2  m t ai hence we must multiply inhibition's synaptic strength ai g by the square root of the average firing rate and the number of active neurons n to convert it into the kuramoto model's coupling strength k 2 relateprctok nb
