cantilever magnetometry and macroscopic quantum tunneling cantilever magnetometry and macroscopic quantum tunneling the goal is to measure coherent tunneling of perhaps 10 4 magnetic spins between easy axis direction orientations in small ferromagnetic particles a similar quantum rotation of the neel vector in an antiferromagnetic particle is also expected and would be detected by way of the uncompensated spins experimentally construction of a cantilever based torque magnetometer is underway starting with a fiber optic interferometric displacement detection system the first step will be magnetic measurements of the molecular magnet mn 12 acetate microcrystals of this material have been attached to silicon microcantilevers
