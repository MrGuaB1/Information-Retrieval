artandi lab research interests telomerase cancer stem cells aging stem cells regenerating tissues are maintained by stem cells that have the capacity to self renew and to give rise to all lineages within a tissue telomerase is expressed in stem cells and progenitor cells but its role in these compartments remains poorly understood to begin to understand telomerase function in stem cell populations we conditionally expressed tert in mouse skin in vivo we found that tert activated quiescent stem cells in the bulge region of hair follicles tert mediated activation of hair follicle stem cells led to a developmental change in the hair follicle from the resting stage telogen to the active stage anagen by enabling this transition tert supported robust hair growth by labeling bulge stem cells with the thymidine analogue brdu we showed that tert caused proliferation in this normally quiescent population to understand the mechanism of this potent effect on stem cells we studied conditional tert upregulation in a terc background the effects of tert in a terc background were identical initiating a new anagen cycle therefore this novel role for tert occurs through a mechanism that does not require terc and is therefore independent of tert's telomere synthesis function we are actively investigating the effects of tert on other stem cell populations furthermore we are dissecting tert's mechanism of action in molecular detail 2009 artandi lab stanford university mc all rights reserved
