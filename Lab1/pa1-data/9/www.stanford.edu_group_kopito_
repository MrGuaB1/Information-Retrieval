kopito lab kopito lab the cell is an extremely crowded environment where it is estimated that the concentration of protein exceeds 200 mg ml newly synthesized proteins achieve their three dimensional structure by folding within this highly dynamic jungle of proteins nucleic acids and lipids cells must ensure that those proteins which fail to fold are efficiently disposed or suffer the consequences misfolded proteins are toxic to cells and are notoriously connected with the vast majority of neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's huntington's and parkinson's diseases as well as a number of other diseases of folding such as cystic fibrosis and  1 antitrypsin deficiency for over 20 years our lab has sought to understand 1 how misfolded proteins are detected and destroyed by quality control pathways within the cell ie the ubiquitin proteasome and autophagy systems and 2 how cells defend against protein aggregates recent lab news about us
