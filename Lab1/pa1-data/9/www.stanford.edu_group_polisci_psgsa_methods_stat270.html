stats 270 370 stats 270 370 back to main page comments a good introduction to bayesian statistics it was taught by persi diaconis the time i took it if persi ever teaches it again i would recommend taking it he can be a little hard to follow at times but knows the material well and goes off on interesting tangents he's also possibly the leading bayesian statistician in the world the course is taught at a reasonably high mathematical level mainly aimed at the phd students taking the stats 370 version but the problem sets and grading for the master's version stats 270 were somewhat easier alex tahk
