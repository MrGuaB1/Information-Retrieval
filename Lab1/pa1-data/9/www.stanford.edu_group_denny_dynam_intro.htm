untitled document measuring the hydrodynamic forces or water velocities beneath breaking waves is a difficult task a simple way to find the maximum forces and velocities that a location has experienced is to use these mechanical dynamometers much like the maximum recording spring scales used to measure fish these provide a single measurement of the largest force experienced by a test ball since the last time they were read these devices are robust inexpensive and simple to construct the following pages will explain how to build and use them
