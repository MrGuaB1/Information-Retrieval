n tetrasperma 8 spored page 1 the perkins lab neurospora genetics and biology department of biological sciences stanford university eight spored asci in certain genotypes of neurospora tetrasperma asci of n tetrasperma are normally four spored and each ascospore encloses two nuclei of opposite mating type mat a and mat a consequently single ascospore cultures are self fertile such species are said to be pseudohomothallic or secondarily homothallic dodge 1927 the pseudohomothallic behavior of n tetrasperma results from the first division segregation of mating types followed by spindle overlap at second and third divisions and pair wise alignment of nuclei prior to spore delimitation figs 1 2 raju 1992 gallego et al 2000 at least three genotypes are known in n tetrasperma that perturb the four spored ascus program resulting in 5 to 8 spored asci figs 3 4 24 1 dodge's gene e eight spore eight spore originated in a n tetrasperma wild strain from texas dodge 1939 when heterozygous e caused a majority up to 80 of asci to produce 5 8 spores with 5 and 6 spored asci being more frequent than 7 and 8 spored asci the remaining 20 of asci were four spored in the 5 8 spored asci one or more large heterokaryotic ascospores were replaced by pairs of small homokaryotic ascospores fig 3 the alignment of spindle at the first division is normal in almost all asci figs 5 7 however the alignment of spindles at the second and third divisions and pair wise association of nuclei were altered in asci that are destined to produce 5 to 8 spores in many asci the second and or third division spindles failed to overlap and their orientation relative to other spindles was often abnormal see figs 8 13 consequently the nuclei failed to associate in pairs and two or more single nuclei became sequestered into smaller ascospores figs 16 20 raju 1992 the smaller ascospores matured normally but produced homokakryotic self sterile cultures fig 22 we have used dodge's e gene to examine the behavior of sk 2 and sk 3 in the larger heterokaryotic and in the smaller homokaryotic ascospores of n tetrasperma raju and perkins 1991 2 spore killer 3 augments eight spore phenotype in e background in crosses of e x sk 3 or wild type x e sk 3 over 90 of asci contained 6 to 8 ascospores fig 4 we have used young developing asci from these two crosses for correlating 8 spore phenotype with abnormal spindle alignment and behavior as expected the spindles at the second division were aligned in tandem and failed to align in pairs across the ascus at the first postmeiotic mitosis instead they were aligned equidistant and oriented irregularly relative to one another figs 8 13 this abnormal spindle behavior resulted in failed pair wise association of nuclei prior to spore delimitation and cutting of mostly 6 to 8 spored asci figs 14 15 21 in contrast to sk 3 spore killer 2 did not augment the eight spore phenotype of e however 3 production of eight spored asci in certain out crosses of n tetrasperma when single mating type strains from diverse wild collected heterokaryons were isolated and intercrossed several crosses produced 8 spored asci jacobson 1995 in certain combinations all asci were four spored when one parent was used as protoperithecial parent but they were all eight spored when the parents were reversed in reciprocal crosses figs 23 24 in the eight spored crosses developing asci showed non overlapping spindles at second and third divisions the nuclei failed to associate in pairs lined up in single file and cutout eight uninucleate ascospores similar to the behavior in the eight spored asci of n crassa raju 1992 jacobson 1995 return to the photos page to view other series of photographs for permission to use these photos and copyright information click here click on thumbnails to view enlarged photos with captions previous page 1 2 next fig 1 ascus diagram fig 2 ascus development fig 3 e x wild type ascus rosette fig 4 e sk 3 x wt ascus rosette fig 5 e sk 3 x sk 3 metaphase i fig 6 e sk 3 x wt metaphase i fig 7 e sk 3 x sk 3 telophase i fig 8 e sk 3 x sk 3 metaphase ii fig 9 e sk 3 x sk 3 metaphase ii fig 10 e sk 3 x sk 3 metaphase ii fig 11 e sk 3 x wt telophase ii fig 12 e sk 3 x sk 3 metaphase iii permission and copyright you may use any of these photos for educational purposes not for profit we ask that you use a credit line citing the original reference and the photographer high resolution versions of these photos are available upon request from nb raju's photo collection see contacts if previously published photos are to be used in publication permission will of course be required from the publisher see the captions of enlarged photos perkins lab home department home university home contact us 2004 david d perkins
