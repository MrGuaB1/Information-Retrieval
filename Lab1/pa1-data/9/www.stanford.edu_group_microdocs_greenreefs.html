microdocs the sea is green how reefs protect the land reefs & resorts the sea is green little fish crown of thorns how much reef do you need it really sucks being a tuna coral bleaching city vs village fishing big fish global warming the acid ocean home sustainability on coral reefs the sea is green the sea is green many coral reef organisms eat algae and prevent it from taking over the reef if one type of herbivore is reduced in numbers other species can often take over and control algae however coral reefs that have lost diversity may not have herbivores waiting to take over these reefs will quickly be smothered by algae why is the sea green the waters surrounding a coral reef are normally blue and very clear coral surfaces are tan or brown but the coral reef turns green if algae take over the reef turns green because floating particles of algae color the water algae can grow much faster than coral and if not controlled will overgrow the reef many coral reef organisms eat algae and prevent it from taking over but what happens when if these herbivores are lost where are the herbivores sea urchins such as the black spined sea urchin diadema antillarum eat and in large numbers control algae likewise some reef fish are mostly vegetarian surgeon fish and others such as parrot fish graze the coral surface this gives coral polyps the space to settle and grow in 1983 and 1984 a disease struck the caribbean killing over 93 long spined sea urchin leading to high amounts of algae and coral death algae immediately began to flourish this increase was minimal on reefs with many herbivorous fish because they took over as the main control of algae coral still had space to develop and grow on these reefs unfortunately these fish are good eating and were overfished on many reefs overfished coral reefs were smothered by algae because there was nothing to control them these reefs turned green can we turn the sea back to blue the easiest way to control algae is by preserving the organisms that eat it setting aside areas where these herbivores are free from interference gives them time and space to grow and reproduce these protected areas provide a reservoir of herbivores and algae control for the protected area and the surrounding region marine parks have been created in the caribbean islands of bonaire st lucia and many others these protected reefs are recovering from the loss of the black spined sea urchin fish have increased in size and numbers and help control the algae they also add to the local economy as an additional benefit these marine parks attract thousands of tourists and fishing in the waters surrounding these parks has improved dramatically sustainability and green reefs diversity influences ecosystem resilience because high diversity ecosystems resist or recover from disturbance faster ecosystems often become more vulnerable to further diversity loss once diversity has initially been lost weedy algae were able to dominate overfished reefs after the loss of the long spined urchin because diversity and resilience had already been reduced these overfished reefs then lost even more diversity because coral was overgrown and the species that rely on it were lost in contrast more diverse reefs had fish to take over as algae control and the loss of the urchins had much less impact however these reefs are now more vulnerable to disturbance unless urchin numbers build up and diversity is restored references lessios h 1988 mass mortality of diadema antillarum in the caribbean what have we learned annual review of ecology and systematics 19 371 93 lessios h et al 1984 19 october spread of diadema mass mortality through the caribbean science pdf retrieved 22 august 2008 from http www sciencemag org cgi reprint 226 4672 335 pdf ijkey 0a485cd939fe5b4ec3df4e19a9d5e8a88bce4997 mcginley m 2007 october 18 threats to coral reefs encyclopedia of earth retrieved 31 july 2008 from http www eoearth org article threats_to_coral_reefs mumby p et al 2006 january 6 fishing trophic cascades and the process of grazing on coral reefs science retrieved 22 august 2008 from http www sciencemag org cgi content full 311 5757 98 palumbi s mcleod k & grunbaum d 2008 ecosystems in action lessons from marine ecology about recovery resistance and reversibility bioscience 58 1 33 42 palumbi s et al 2009 managing for ocean biodiversity creating a national biodiversity conservation agenda to sustain marine ecosystem services frontiers in ecology and the environment all content property of microdocs project last updated march 13 2012
