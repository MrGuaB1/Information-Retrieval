microdocs sustainability on coral reefs how reefs protect the land reefs & resorts the sea is green little fish crown of thorns how much reef do you need it really sucks being a tuna coral bleaching city vs village fishing big fish global warming the acid ocean home sustainability on coral reefs sustainability on coral reefs summary reefs supply millions with food and other resources this ecosystem is facing greater rates of disturbance because of our actions too much disturbance reduces the productivity diversity and resilience of the coral reef ecosystem preserving this ecosystem will rely largely on preserving the habitats and species of the coral reef ecosystem healthy coral reefs supply food and other resources for millions of people worldwide the health of coral reefs is eroding because many of our actions create too much disturbance coral reefs are becoming less productive just when we need them the most why care about coral reefs coral reefs cover less than 1 of the oceans area but they directly support millions of people by supplying food employment and other resources even more people benefit from coral reefs indirectly this ecosystem helps feed 1 billion people in asia alone the human population is nearly 7 billion people and it is likely to grow to 9 billion by 2040 we need coral reefs and other ecosystems to supply more and more resources to support our growing numbers but they are being increasingly threatened with destruction threats to coral reef sustainability coral reefs are under threat worldwide habitat destruction threatens 1 3 of all reef building corals with extinction threats to this ecosystem include pollution over fishing ocean acidification habitat destruction global warming eutrophication disease destructive fishing practices damage from anchors and watercraft coral reefs can recover from these disturbances if given enough time however the disturbance rate is building to the point where a new disturbance hits before the reef has recovered from the last one this erodes the resilience and productivity of the coral reef ecosystem how do you maintain coral reef productivity ecosystem productivity typically increases with diversity and coral reefs are no exception this productive ecosystem is home for over 14 of all marine fish species protecting coral reef diversity is crucial to keeping this ecosystem productive diversity also affects coral reefs ability to resist disturbance species react to disturbance in various ways some species cannot live in disturbed areas where other species will thrive diverse reefs are more resilient and have a better chance to resist and recover from disturbance we can protect coral reef productivity by protecting habitat reducing pollution reducing damaging run off from the land consensus statement highlighting common threats to pacific ocean ecosystems references bruce s 2008 july 10 one third of reef building corals face extinction eurekalert retrieved 10 july 2008 from http www eurekalert org pub_releases 2008 07 ci oto070208 php hughes tp 2003 august 15 climate change human impacts and the resilience of coral reefs science 301 929 933 retrieved 18 june 2008 from http www sciencemag org cgi content full 301 5635 929 icun 2008 10 july one third of reef building corals face extinction international union for conservation of nature retrieved 10 july 2008 from http cms iucn org index cfm unewsid 1279 international coral reef initiative 2007 what are coral reefs iyor 2008 retrieved 2 april 2008 from http www iyor org reefs kent et al 2008 july 10 one third of reef building corals face elevated extinction risk from climate change and local impacts sciencexpress pdf retrieved 10 july 2008 from http www sciencemag org cgi rapidpdf 1159196v1 pdf moore f & best b 2001 coral reef crisis causes and consequences the american association for the advancement of science retrieved 1 april 2008 from http www aaas org international africa coralreefs ch1 shtml un atlas of the oceans 2007 july 17 the value of coral reefs un atlas of the oceans retrieved 1 april 2008 from http www oceansatlas com servlet cdsservlet status us census bureau 2008 june 18 world popclock projection us census bureau population division international programs center retrieved 3 july 2008 from http www census gov ipc www popclockworld html us census bureau 2008 june 18 world population trends us census bureau population division international programs center retrieved 3 july 2008 from http www census gov ipc www idb worldpopinfo html wafar m & wafar s 2001 coral diversity the national institute of oceanography nio retrieved 1 april 2008 from http www nio org the_seas around_us corals chap1 htm world resources institute 1998 june reefs and people what is at stake world resources institute retrieved 1 april 2008 from http www wri org publication content 8232 all content property of microdocs project last updated january 5 2012
