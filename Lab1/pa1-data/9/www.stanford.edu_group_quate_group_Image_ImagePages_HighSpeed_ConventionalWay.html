conventional way home the image above shows a schematic of a conventional afm probe deflection is monitored with a split photodiode that observes the motion of a deflected laser beam this deflection is sent into the feedback control loop where a computer collects the deflection value at each pixel and an actuator driver uses high voltage to move the probe in the z direction such that a constant force is maintained between the tip and the sample the speed of this constant force imaging process is limited by the first resonance of the large piezotube in the z direction which is about 600 hz high speed introduction bode plot comparison home micromachining imaging lithography biosensors other work questions comments mail quatewebmaster
