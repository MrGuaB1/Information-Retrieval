aquarius aquarius numerical methods for uncertainty quantification and prediction of high reynolds number flows aquarius is an associate team between inria project team bacchus the uncertainty quantification laboratory and charbel farhat group in stanford university funded from 2011 to 2013 stochastic inverse analysis an hybrid method based on polynomial chaos genetic algorithms is used for stochastic inverse analysis and applied on the numerical simulation of a dense gas shock tube previous theoretical and numerical studies have shown that a rarefaction shock wave rsw is relatively weak and that the prediction of its occurrence and intensity are highly sensitive to uncertainties on the initial flow conditions and on the fluid thermodynamic model the objective of this work is to introduce an innovative flexible and efficient algorithm combining computational fluid dynamics cfd uncertainty quantification uq tools and metamodel based optimization in order to obtain a reliable estimate for the rsw probability of occurrence and to prescribe the experimental accuracy requirements ensuring the reproducibility of the measurements with sufficient confidence scientists involved pm congedo g iaccarino jas witteveen pm congedo p colonna c corre jas witteveen g iaccarino backward uncertainty propagation method in flow problems application to the prediction of rarefaction shock waves paper submitted top menu home page presentation of the collaboration members program and results 2011 2012 publications phd thesis visits internships workshops events see also the associate team program on inria's website contact pietro marco congedo pietro congedo inria fr members area restricted access to members only inria team bacchus web site stanford team uq web site
