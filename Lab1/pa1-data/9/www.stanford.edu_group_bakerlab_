baker lab baker lab stanford university cellular differentiation is governed by dynamic changes occurring in the genome we are interested in how these mechanisms including epigenetic marks changes in chromatin structure and gene expression are used by the genome to instruct the very first differentiation events in the embryo these differentiation events begin when the blastocyst becomes fated toward either embryonic or extraembryonic tissues and then continue upon the beginning of the first germ layers endoderm ectoderm and mesoderm to understand these dramatic early events we have developed human embryonic stem cells as a model system we are able to differentiate hescs into definitive endoderm trophoblast and ectoderm and are developing new ways to derive hescs from human blastocysts which are free from animal contaminants and more karyotypically stable than those currently available to date our major contribution has been in the study of endoderm and trophoblast cells either in whole embryos using expression cloning or microarray analysis or in hesc differentiated toward these lineages more recently we have made significant progress in using novel genomic tools including high throughput sequencing to elucidate methylation patterns chromatin structure and transcriptional differences between naive hesc and definitive endoderm derived from hescs furthermore we have performed an extensive analysis on the regulation of the transcriptome throughout embryogenesis in both the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages and are currently using these comprehensive datasets to understand gene regulation during organogenesis and gastrulation in the mouse using this data we have made inroads into understanding placental morphogenesis and the evolution of this novel organ knox and baker mitiku and baker our goals for the future are to use the genomic information obtained from these early differentiation events to inform the eventual creation of new tissues for therapeutics welcome to the baker lab website research interests genomics of definitive endoderm hepatocytes derived from hescs derivation of hescs with genetic abnormalities mammalian placenta development & evolution lab people publications contact
