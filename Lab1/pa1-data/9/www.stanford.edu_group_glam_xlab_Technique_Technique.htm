x ray lab technique x ray diffraction laboratory is currently equipped with three diffractometers panalytical x pert 1 panalytical x pert 2 laue analytical x pert 1 and 2 are multipurpose diffractometers that can be used for high resolution as well as for lower resolution measurements the diffractometer usually consists of the following basic parts x ray source incident beam conditioner sample stage diffracted beam conditioner detector in order to obtain specific structural information from the material by using x ray diffraction we need to combine the above mentioned parts into an arrangement that would balance resolution intensity and data collection time the xrd techniques here are divided into high resolution mostly used for near perfect epitaxial thin films and single crystals panalytical x pert 1 high resolution mode can also be used for textured epitaxial thin films medium resolution primarily used for thin films that are textured epitaxial textured polycrystalline also can be used for polycrystalline and amorphous materials low resolution mostly used for polycrystalline as well as amorphous materials laue diffractometer is mostly used for alignment of single crystals the diffractometer can also be used for indexing
