jelly coat on eggs jelly coat on eggs sea urchin eggs have a jelly coat around them that serves them in many ways it prevents too many sperm from getting to the egg at the same time because of its viscosity proteins in the jelly initiate the acrosome reaction in sperm so they are ready to fertilize the egg it provides a sort of shock absorber to prevent injury to the egg from wave action it is colorless so it is difficult to see add a small amount of sumi ink to the sea water surrounding the eggs to make the jelly layer more visible the ink particles are too big to get through the jelly layer and are excluded where the ink is excluded more light can get through and we see the jelly layer as a clearing around the eggs
