cross cultural blog taesung's freewrite cross cultural blog a blog for students and teachers participating in the cross cultural rhetoric project cindy's freewrite main catherine's freewrite taesung's freewrite i want to write about the protest in tibet for my research project i think the current situation in tibet resembles that of korea during world war ii tibet and korea both wanted to be independent and actually showed their will for freedom to the global society through demonstration i will analyze the photos shown in the major newspapers in both the us and china for example the first picture is from people's daily the largest newspaper in china the second picture is from the new york times we can see that the themes of the photos are very different from each other people's daily focused on chinese mainland people's antagonism against tibet while the new york times focused on the brutality of chinese police suppressing the protest one main concern about the topic on tibet is that the photos usually don t have profundity the photos were just taken in chaos without any consideration or plans of the photographers posted by stanford visual rhetoric across the globe on april 21 2008 12 20 am permalink trackback trackback url for this entry http cgi stanford edu group ccr mt mt tb cgi 289 comments i really like the historical parallel you draw between tibet and korea perhaps you can take this further and see how the korean war was portrayed by the media in those days also it might be interesting to analyze just how colored or angled the us china portrayal of the situation is questions to ask include can the media truly represent a situation without adopting an angle and how does this coloration affect the elicited responses additionally instead of just analyzing photos you can take headlines and other hybrid texts into account which will partially solve your profundity problem i really like your topic posted by cindy guan april 21 2008 11 49 pm
