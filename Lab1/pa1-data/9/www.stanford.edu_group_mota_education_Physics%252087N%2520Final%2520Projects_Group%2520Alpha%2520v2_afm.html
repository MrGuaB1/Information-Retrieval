atomic force microscope the atomic force microscope afm is a scanning probe microscope that measures various material properties by bringing a small tip mounted on a cantilever very close to a surface the afm has two modes of operation the first is known as contact mode and involves physically dragging the tip across the sample the deflection of the cantilever and tip is measured by a laser beam and the information is compiled into a topographic map the second mode of operation brings the tip extremely close to the surface without touching it and a feedback loop adjusts the height of the cantilever so that the force is kept constant this also produces a topographic map of the surface the second mode of operation is used by dpn technology as the molecules are deposited on the surface from the coated probe tip via a water meniscus the afm tip does not touch the sample image modeled after the diagram at basselt david how afm works http stm2 nrl navy mil how afm how afm html general 20concept
