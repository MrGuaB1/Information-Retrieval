the stanford university learning locomotion project overview legged robots unlike wheeled robots have the potential to access nearly all of the earth's land mass enabling robotic applications in areas where they are currently infeasible however the current control software for legged robots is quite limited and does not let them realize this potential in the learning locomotion project we seek to develop software that significantly advances the state of the art in robotic quadruped locomotion over rough terrain to achieve this goal we develop and apply novel control and machine learning algorithms we gratefully acknowledge darpa for supporting this work the littledog robot the robotic platform for this research is the littledog robot designed and built by boston dynamics inc publications stereo vision and terrain modeling for quadruped robots j zico kolter youngjun kim and andrew y ng to appear in proceedings of the ieee international conference on robotics and automation 2009 pdf task space trajectories via cubic spline optimization j zico kolter and andrew y ng to appear in proceedings of the ieee international conference on robotics and automation 2009 pdf a control architecture for quadruped locomotion over rough terrain j zico kolter mike p rodgers and andrew y ng in proceedings of the ieee international conference on robotics and automation 2008 pdf hierarchical apprenticeship learning with application to quadruped locomotion j zico kolter pieter abbeel and andrew y ng in neural information processing systems 2007 pdf learning omnidirectional path following using dimensionality reduction j zico kolter and andrew y ng in proceedings of robtics science and systems 2007 pdf quadruped robot obstacle negotiation via reinforcement learning honglak lee yirong shen chih han yu gurjeet singh and andrew y ng in proceedings of the ieee international conference on robotics and automation 2006 pdf videos and pictures dynamic jumping manuever 12 2008 wmv onboard stereo vision 9 2008 mp4 crossing terrains of increasing difficulty 9 2007 mp4 wmv low res mp4 wmv planning before after learning 1 9 2007 mp4 wmv low res mp4 wmv planning before after learning 2 9 2007 mp4 wmv low res mp4 wmv crossing terrain snapshots 9 2007 jpg omnidirectional path following 6 2006 mpg wmv learning to balance 6 2006 mpg wmv people faculty andrew y ng students j zico kolter pieter abbeel yirong shen honglak lee sam schreiber youngjun kim mike rodgers stanford university stanford cs department stanford ai lab
