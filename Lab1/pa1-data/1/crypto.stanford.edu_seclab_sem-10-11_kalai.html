stanford security seminar stanford security seminar logo cryptography robust against side channel attacks yael tauman kalai abstract traditionally cryptographers assume that the secret keys are totally hidden from the adversary however in reality there are various real world physical attacks including timing and power attacks which allow an adversary to continually leak information about the secret keys in addition there are various attacks including heat and em radiation attacks which allow an adversary to continually tamper with the secret keys recently there has been a large and growing body of work which tries to secure cryptographic systems against such so called side channel attacks in this talk i will review some of these results and focus on two recent results which show how to construct encryption and signature schemes that are secure even against an adversary that continually leaks bounded information about the secret key and continually tampers with the secret key these results are based on joint work with zvika brakerski jonathan katz and vinod vaikuntanathan and on joint work with bhavana kanukurthi and amit sahai time and place feb 25 2010 friday at 1600 hrs gates 463a stanford security seminar
