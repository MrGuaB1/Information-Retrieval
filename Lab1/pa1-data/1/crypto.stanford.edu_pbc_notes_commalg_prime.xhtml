commutative algebra prime and maximal ideals my notes commutative algebra rings ring homomorphisms ideals nilpotent elements prime and maximal ideals posets maximal ideals local rings factorization the nilradical the jacobson radical operations on ideals direct sums ideal quotients radicals extension and contraction exercises modules submodules and quotient modules operations on submodules direct sums and products finitely generated modules and free modules exact sequences prime and maximal ideals an ideal p of r is called prime if p r and for all x y &element r if x y &element p then x &element p or y &element p it is easily verified that if p is a nonzero ideal then p is prime if and only if r p is an integral domain in particular 0 is prime if and only if r is an integral domain example the prime ideals of &zopf are 0 and p &zopf for p prime an ideal m of r is maximal if m r and there is no ideal i such that m &subset i &subset a where the inclusions are strict it it easily verified that if m is a nonzero ideal then m is maximal if and only if a m is a field this implies all maximal ideals are prime the converse is not true in general for example 0 is prime in &zopf but not maximal proposition let f r &rightarrow s be a ring homomorphism and q be a prime ideal of s then f 1 q x &element r &verticalbar f x &element q is a prime ideal of r proof let  be the natural map s &rightarrow s q then ker  f x &element r &verticalbar f x &element q f 1 q so r f 1 q r ker  f and by the fundamental homomorphism theorem this is isomorphic to some subring of s q but s q is an integral domain since q is prime so r f 1 q is also an integral domain implying that f 1 q is indeed prime preimages of maximal ideals need not be maximal for example consider the identity injection f &zopf &rightarrow &qopf then 0 f 1 0 is not maximal in &zopf though it is maximal in &qopf my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
