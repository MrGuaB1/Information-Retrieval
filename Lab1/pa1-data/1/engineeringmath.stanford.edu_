engineering mathematics new computational mathematics courses offered for freshmen & sophomores with strong interest in engineering e154 introduction to engineering mathematics e155a mathematical and computational methods for engineers e155b mathematical and computational methods for engineers and e155c mathematical and computational methods for engineers a new sequence of mathematics courses has been developed for students interested in pursuing degrees in engineering the sequence will cover important areas of engineering mathematics such as multivariable calculus linear algebra ordinary and partial differential equations numerical methods probability and statistics and will emphasize engineering applications and computation using matlab the intent is a to introduce freshmen and sophomores to the relevant mathematics and computational tools early in their college career b to excite their interest in the engineering disciplines and provide early exposure to the engineering faculty and the use of computation in solving real engineering problems the new sequence consisting of e154 multivariable calculus with linear algebra e155a ordinary differential equations e155b partial differential equations with linear algebra and or e155c probability and statistics can be used to satisfy the general engineering mathematics requirement the courses will be offered starting in the fall of 2002 during the following quarters fall 2002 winter 2002 2003 spring 2003 e154 e155a e154 e155c e155a e155b short course descriptions are avialable at e154 introduction to engineering mathematics e155a mathematical and computational methods for engineers e155b mathematical and computational methods for engineers e155c mathematical and computational methods for engineers if you have any questions please contact vadim khayms at vadim khayms lmco com or prof parviz moin at moin stanford edu
