ssl mitm proxy ssl man in the middle proxy description documents download usage credits description mitm proxy is an java based ssl proxy that acts as a man in the middle in other words proxied https requests are terminated by the proxy and resent to the remote webserver the server certificates presented to the client ie a web browser are dynamically generated signed by the proxy and contain most of the same fields as the original webserver certificate the subject dn serial number validity dates and extensions are preserved however the issuer dn is now set to the name of the proxy's self signed certificate and the public private keys of the proxy are used in creating the forged certificate these forged certificates are cached in memory by the proxy for better performance documents powerpoint presentation the basis for this code was the grinder tcpsniffer project download note this tool can not be used for any commercial purposes as is because it makes use of an educational research version of the iaik jce library version 1.0 april 12th 2007 usage the mitm proxy requires a java runtime 1.5 or later and has been tested on various windows and linux platforms for the impatient the included readme file contains quick start instructions the proxy server is started from the command line in the following way java mitm mitmproxyserver options where options can include localhost host name ip default is localhost localport port default is 8001 keystore file key store details for keystorepassword pass certificates equivalent to keystoretype type javax net ssl xxx properties keystorealias alias default is keytool default of mykey outputfile filename default is stdout v verbose proxy output h print this message notes on the options keystore is a java keystore file containing a self signed proxy certificate a new self signed proxy certificate can be created by invoking keytool genkey keystore your file storepass your pass keyalg rsa outputfile will contain the plaintext http requests that are being proxied verbose proxy output includes details about the proxied data connection's endpoints the remote webserver certificate's common name field the newly forged certificates once the proxy server is started your web browser will need to be configured to make use of an ssl proxy with the same host port as above note that unless the proxy's certificate is imported into your browser ca certificate store you will see warnings about untrusted server certificates credits staff dan boneh srinivas inguva ian baker background originally developed for use in a class project for cs255 introduction to cryptography taught by prof boneh in winter 2007 stanford security lab
