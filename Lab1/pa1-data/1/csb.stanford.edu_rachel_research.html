rachel's papers rachel kolodny home personal papers approximate protein structural alignment in polynomial time with nathan linial proc natl acad sci usa 2004 101 12201 12206 pdf online material protein structural alignment is a fundamental problem in computational structural biology here we study it as a family of optimization problem and provide a polynomial time algorithm to solve them we also show an np hardness proof of an alternative approach to this problem using internal distance matrices lastly we visualize the scoring function for several pairs of structures protein decoy assembly using short fragments under geometric constraints with michael levitt biopolymers 2003 68 278 285 pdf we use the libraries of fragments described below to generate decoys for several proteins coupled with a descriminating energy function decoys are useful for predicting protein structure it seems that this method works well for all alpha proteins small libraries of protein fragments model native protein structures accurately with patrice koehl leonidas guibas and michael levitt j mol biol 2002 323 297 307 pdf online material we study efficient means of modeling protein structure our model concatenates elements from libraries of commonly observed protein backbone fragments into approximate structures there are no additional degrees of freedom so a string of fragment labels fully defines a three dimensional structure the set of all strings defines the set of structures of a given length by varying the size of the library and the length of its fragments we generate structure sets of different resolution with larger libraries the approximations are better but we get good fits to real proteins less than 1a with less than 5 states per residue
