vehicle yaw rate estimation using differential wheel speeds page 1 vehicle yaw rate estimation using differential wheel speeds professor j christian gerdes professor j david powell christopher r carlson the setup consists of a single board computer pictured left abs wheel speed sensors on all four wheels and a rate gyro the wheel speed signals are stock variable reluctance sinusoids passed through a logic level output zero crossing detector the wheel speed magnitudes were calibrated by matching the frequency of the pulse train to a known speedometer reading the rate gyro is an analog output mems coriolis effect gyro the yaw gyro was calibrated by subtracting its steady state bias while the vehicle was at rest figure 1 pentium single board computer a detailed look at the vehicle model and some initial modeling results can be found at http wwwcdr stanford edu dynamic navigation navigation html model details preliminary data cpu page 2 preliminary experimental results this is a look at the preliminary wheel speed data and the corresponding model yaw rate compared to a yaw gyro installed in the vehicle the wheel speed data for these figures is 4 th order low pass filtered but has been post processed to have zero time delay by filtering forward with two poles and filtering backward with 2 poles the phase shift of the signal sums to zero this is not realistic for a real time implementation but gives some insight into the underlying lags in the system note how the front wheels track the yaw gyro all the way up to about 2 hz while the rear wheel signals start to lag after about 1 hz further work will involve a more detailed look at tire modeling which should provide some insight into predicting this effect
