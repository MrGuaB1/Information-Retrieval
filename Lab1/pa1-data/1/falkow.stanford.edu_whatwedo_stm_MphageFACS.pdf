facs analysis of bacteria from infected macrophages infection seed 24 well dishes at desired density day before infecting inoc page 1 facs analysis of bacteria from infected macrophages protocol from ak lee falkow lab modified by i brodsky infection seed 24 well dishes at desired density i like to seed at 5x104 and let them grow for 2 days assuming a 24hr doubling time day before infecting inoculate standing o n bacterial cultures with desired strains take od600 of bacteria dilute bacteria to desired cfu ml based on od600 1.0 1.2 x109 cfu ml infect cells with bacteria in 50 l volume for 30 for facs infect at moi 25 50 to ensure enough bacteria inside cells at 30 aspirate bacteria add 1 ml dmem well analysis after adding 1 ml dmem to each well take 0 time point each timepoint and each strain has 2 data points a outside bacteria b inside bacteria outside bacteria remove 1 ml dmem from well put in facs tube inside bacteria aftrer removing dmem for outside bacteria add 200 l 0.1 triton x 100 in pbs incubate 5 min lyse cells by pipetting up and down 20 times add 800 l dmem remove entire 1 ml put in facs tube i usually take time points can every 30 although this can be a little hectic facs collection histogram should be formatted slightly differently than for bacteria in medium scale should be 30 50 not 90 it may help to have the histogram plot only the gated data rather than all of it
