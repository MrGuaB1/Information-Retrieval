cits hall thruster program center for integrated turbulence simulations hall thruster program hall thruster the cits is planning a program in plasma turbulence the focus problem of interest is the hall thruster a device used by the russians for satellite station keeping and currently being considered for several us satellites including the teledesic constellation in order to function efficiently hall thrusters require a broadband instability in an electromagnetic field reminiscent of instabilities seen in the turbulence of ordinary fluids currently hall thrusters can be made with fairly high specific impulse up to 2000 s and thrust efficiency near 50 but only at very low thrust levels 20 80mn stanford's plasma dynamics lab pdl has designed built and is currently testing a variety of hall thruster configurations however only a rudimentary understanding of the unsteady behavior of hall thrusters is currently known well resolved simulations of turbulent plasmas at the cits will help us better understand this important fundamental phenomenon
