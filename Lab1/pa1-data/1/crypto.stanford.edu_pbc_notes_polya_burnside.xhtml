polya theory burnside's lemma my notes polya theory group actions burnside's lemma the cycle index polynomial polya's inventory theorem burnside's lemma burnside's lemma points the way to an effective method for counting the number of orbits define fix  g  &element  g   that is the set of all colourings fixed by a given symmetry for example if s is the reflection that takes 123456 to 654321 then fix  s is the set of all colourings that are palindromes when written out using our notation such as rgbbgr this definition looks similar to some of our previous definitions and it feels like they should be closely related in fact they are lemma burnside let n be the number of orbits then n 1 &verticalbar g &verticalbar &sum g &element g &verticalbar fix  g &verticalbar proof let the orbits be  1  n which partition  then for any g &element g the sets fix  1 g fix  n g partition fix  g thus &sum g &element g &verticalbar fix  g &verticalbar &sum g &element g &sum k &verticalbar fix  k g &verticalbar &verticalbar g  g &element g  &element  g   &verticalbar &sum k &sum  &element  i &verticalbar g  &verticalbar applying &verticalbar g  &verticalbar &verticalbar orb g  &verticalbar &verticalbar g &verticalbar completes the proof my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
