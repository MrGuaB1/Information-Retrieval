isogeometric analysis application to integrated computer aided design and finite element analysis events at stanford isogeometric analysis application to integrated computer aided design and finite element analysis facebook twitter email print add to calendar computational geometry has until very recently had little impact upon the numerical solution of partial differential equations the purpose of this talk is to explore isogeometric analysis in which nurbs non uniform rational b splines and t splines are employed to construct exact geometric models 1 2 of complex domains i will review recent progress toward developing integrated computer aided design cad finite element analysis fea procedures that do not involve traditional mesh generation and geometry clean up steps that is the cad file is directly utilized as the analysis input file i will summarize some of the mathematical developments within isogeometric analysis that confirm the superior accuracy and robustness of spline based approximations compared with traditional fea i will present sample applications to problems of solids structures and fluids thomas jr hughes holds be and me degrees in mechanical engineering from pratt institute and an ms in mathematics and ph d in engineering science from the university of california at berkeley he taught at berkeley caltech and stanford before joining the university of texas at austin at stanford he served as chairman of the division of applied mechanics chairman of the department of mechanical engineering chairman of the division of mechanics and computation and occupied the mary and gordon crary family chair of engineering at the university of texas at austin he is professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics and occupies the computational and applied mathematics chair iii dr hughes is a fellow of the american academy of mechanics aam the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics aiaa the american society of civil engineers asce the american society of mechanical engineers asme the us association for computational mechanics usacm the international association for computational mechanics iacm the society of industrial and applied mathematics siam and the american association for the advancement of science aaas he is co editor of the international journal computer methods in applied mechanics and engineering a founder and past president of usacm and iacm past chairman of the applied mechanics division of asme and past chairman of the us national committee on theoretical and applied mechanics usnc tam when thursday march 1 2012 4 30 pm where huang center mackenzie room 300 map audience general public faculty staff students alumni friends members tags lecture reading engineering sponsor john a blume earthquake engineering center contact 3 4150 racquelh stanford edu admission free and open to the public permalink http events stanford edu events 311 31169 more info last modified february 21 2012
