gp b in a nutshell page 1 t est i ng ei nste i n s u n i verse page 2 the enigma of gravity sir isaac newton space and time are absolute or fixed entities gravity is a force that acts instantaneously between objects at a distance causing them to attract one another albert einstein space and time are relative entities interwoven into a spacetime fabric whose curvature we call gravity spacetime tells matter how to move and matter tells spacetime how to curve page 3 a simple experiment gp b co founder bill fairbank once remarked no mission could be simpler than gp b it's just a star a telescope and a spinning sphere however it took over four decades to develop all the cutting edge technologies necessary to carry out this simple experiment page 4 ultra precise gyroscopes to measure the minuscule angles predicted by einstein's theory it was necessary to build near perfect gyroscopes 50 million times more precise than the best navigational gyroscopes the gp b gyro rotors are listed in the guinness database of world records as the most spherical man made objects page 5 squid magnetometers how can one monitor the spin axis orientation of a near perfect spherical gyroscope without any physical marker showing the location of the spin axis on the gyro rotor the answer lies in superconductivity predicted by physicist fritz london in 1948 and most fortunate for gp b a spinning superconductor develops a magnetic moment exactly aligned with its spin axis page 6 pointing telescope a telescope mounted along the central axis of the dewar and spacecraft provided the experiment's pointing reference to a guide star the telescope's image divider precisely split the star's beam into x axis and y axis components whose brightness could be compared page 7 dewar & probe gp b's 650 gallon dewar kept the science instrument inside the probe at a cryogenic temperature 2.3 k for 17.3 months and also provided the thruster propellant for precision attitude and translation control page 8 integrated payload & spacecraft built around the dewar the gp b spacecraft was a total integrated system comprising both the space vehicle and payload dedicated as a single entity to experimentally testing predictions of einstein's theory page 9 a collaborative effort the success of gp b required extraordinary collaboration between the physics and aero astro departments at stanford and between stanford nasa and lockheed martin in 2005 nasa gave a group achievement award to the entire gp b team
