elliptic curves the mov attack my notes elliptic curves overview the weierstrass form group of points explicit addition formulae field of rational functions zeroes and poles rational maps torsion points the weil pairing the weil pairing ii counting points hyperelliptic curves computing the tate pairing the mov attack points of trace zero the mov attack suppose we are given points p xp of an elliptic curve and asked to recover x this is the discrete logarithm problem let e be the weil pairing let m be the order of p let q be a point of order m that is linearly independent to p in other words there is no n such that q n p then e p q and e x p q e p q x can be computed and are both elements of a finite field they are m th roots of unity since p q are linearly independent e p q cannot be unity by the nondegeneracy of the weil pairing thus we have reduced the discrete logarithm problem on the group of points on an elliptic curve to the discrete logarithm on finite fields where subexponential attacks are known my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
