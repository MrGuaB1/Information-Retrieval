point of view madlib page 1 point of view madlib method why use a pov madlib how to use a pov madlib a point of view pov is your reframing of a design challenge into an actionable problem statement that will launch you into generative ideation a pov madlib provides a scaffolding to develop your pov a good pov will allow you to ideate in a directed manner by creating how might we hmw questions based on your pov see facilitating brainstorms most of all your pov captures your design vision your responsibility and opportunity as a designer is to discover and articulate the meaningful challenge use the following the madlib to capture and harmonize three elements of a pov user need and insight user needs to user's need because surprising insight use a whiteboard or scratch paper to try out a number of options playing with each variable and the combinations of them the need and insight should flow from your unpacking and synthesis work remember needs should be verbs and the insight typically should not simply be a reason for the need but rather a synthesized statement that you can leverage in designing a solution keep it sexy it should intrigue people and hold the tension in your pov for example instead of a teenage girl needs more nutritious food because vitamins are vital to good health try a teenage girl with a bleak outlook needs to feel more socially accepted when eating healthy food because in her hood a social risks is more dangerous than a health risk note how the latter is an actionable and potentially generative problem statement while the former is little more than a statement of fact which spurs little excitement or direction to develop solutions
