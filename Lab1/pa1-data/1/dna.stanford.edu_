the brutlag bioinformatics group home people projects courses software presentations publications the brutlag bioinformatics group is located in the biochemistry department at stanford university and is also affiliated with the stanford center for biomedical informatics research in the department of medicine stanford medical school the primary goal of our research was understanding the meaning of the genomic information and how this information is expressed using computational means we were interested in the problems of predicting biological function of genes and gene products from their sequence and structure sometimes known as functional genomics we were also interested in understanding how and when genes are expressed we developed advanced profile and sequence motifs for representing structural and functional aspects of proteins emotif ematrix 3motif and 3matrix these methods can be used for assigning functions to unidentified protein sequences we developed accurate and rapid methods for comparing protein structures and structural database search lock2 and foldminer we were also interested in the areas of secondary structure prediction discovery of promoters and other dna regulatory sequences small molecule and protein docking identifying drug targets and drug design we also developed rapid methods for discovering transcription factor binding sites in coregulated genes both bioprospector and mdscan can take upstream sequences from co regulated genes and can find conserved dna consensus sequences even if they are very short 8bps poorly coonserved 50 interrupted and present in less than 50 of the sequences we are currently involved in teaching computational molecular biology and genomics & medicine computational molecular biology is available both at stanford and online via the stanford center for professional development genomics & medicine is only available to freshmen and sophomores biochemistry 118 genomics & medicine biochemistry 218 computational molecular biology http biochem218 stanford edu we are no longer accepting applications for graduate or postdoctoral students disclaimer for use of these web resources
