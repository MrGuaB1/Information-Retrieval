fish swimming styles fish species that belong to the caudal or trunk swimmers can be subdivided into anguilliform subcarangiform carangiform and thunniform swimmers there is a transition from the eel anguilliform that moves the entire body to the tuna thunniform that only moves the tail the salmonids fall in the middle of this gradation belonging to the group subcarangiform swimmers there are more ways to swim read more about it did you know the thunniform type of swimming where the movement through the water is achieved by movements of the tail with only a very little movement of the head region has evolved four times in non related vertebrate groups it has evolved independently in the teleosts bony fish such as tuna the elasmobranches such assharks in marine mammals whales and dolphins and in the extinct marine reptile ichthyosaurus evolution has this consistent tendency to come up with the same solution in cases where different species have to solve similar design problems
