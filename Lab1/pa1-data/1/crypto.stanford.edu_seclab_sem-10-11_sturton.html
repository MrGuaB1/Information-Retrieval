stanford security seminar stanford security seminar logo defeating uci building stealthy and malicious hardware cynthia sturton abstract in previous work hicks et al proposed a method called unused circuit identification uci for detecting malicious backdoors hidden in circuits at design time the uci algorithm essentially looks for portions of the circuit that go unused during design time testing and flags them as potentially malicious in this paper we construct circuits that have malicious behavior but that would evade detection by the uci algorithm and still pass design time test cases to enable our search for such circuits we define one class of malicious circuits and perform a bounded exhaustive enumeration of all circuits in that class our approach is simple and straight forward yet it proves to be effective at finding circuits that can thwart uci we use the results of our search to construct a practical attack on an open source processor our malicious backdoor allows any user level program running on the processor to enter supervisor mode through the use of a secret knock we close with a discussion on what we see as a major challenge facing any future design time malicious hardware detection scheme identifying a sufficient class of malicious circuits to defend against time and place apr 26 2011 tuesday at 1630 hrs gates 463a stanford security seminar
