fish exercise a swimming fish is an exercising fish i n fish there are a number of different swimming types in some fish like the bottom living sculpins swimming is very slow while other species like the sail fish may reach speeds up to 100 km h this is comparable to the speeds obtained by the fastest land animal the cheeta artic sculpin gymnacanthus tricuspis photo craig franklin sailfish istiophorus platypterus photo randall je 1997 there are three categories of fish swimming capacity sustained swimming non stop swimming for greater than 200 minuter prolonged swimming critical swimming speed bouts of swimming lasting between 15 seconds and 200 minutes burst swimming bouts of swimming lasting less than 15 seconds in aerobic exercise the cardiovascular and respiratory system supply enough oxygen for the fish to be able to swim without fatigue anaerobic exercise is when fish swim at a speed that cannot be supported by the cardiovascular and respiratory system and part or all of the energy has to generated without using oxygen in this case the atp supply to the muscles is slow and this leads to a rapid fatigue the so called prolonged swimming in the table above is a mixture of these two and eventually leads to fatigue due to lactic acid production while the sustained swimming is fully aerobic and can be maintained for long periods without fatigue burst swimming has such high energy demands over such a short period that is more or less fully anaerobic and can be compared to 100 meter sprint races in humans
