group theory generators my notes group theory groups lagrange's theorem cyclic groups generators groups up to order eight the product theorem permutations geometry and groups normal subgroups quotient groups the isomorphism theorems jordan holder decomposition sylow groups abelian groups finitely generated abelian groups generators and relations generators theorem the intersection of subgroups h 1 h 2 is a subgroup of each of h 1 h 2 we say the elements g 1 g m are independent if none of them can be expressed in terms of the others that is g i &langle g 1 g i 1 g i 1 g m &rangle clearly every finite group has at least one set of independent generators independent elements can have relations between them eg if a b are independent then we may have a b 2 1 for example such a relation is called a defining relation given any two groups g h we may form their direct product g h whose elements are pairs g h with g &element g h &element h and the group operation applies coordinatewise the direct product of abelian groups is abelian suppose every element of a group f has the form g h where g &element g h &element h for some subgroups g h of f and furthermore suppose every element of g commutes with every element of h and g h 1 then f g h it is clear how to generalize this to define the direct product to k groups example &zopf 15 &zopf 4 &zopf 2 my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
