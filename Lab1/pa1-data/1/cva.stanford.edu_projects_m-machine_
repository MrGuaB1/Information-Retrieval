m machine project page m machine project page last updated july 17 1998 map chip the 5 million transistor multi alu processor map chip is the core processing element of each node in the m machine multicomputer the design was first taped out on june 9 1998 the m machine is a fine grained multicomputer being designed and built by the concurrent vlsi architecture group at stanford university the group was previously affiliated with the artificial intelligence laboratory at mit the m machine project explores new computer architectures that match semiconductor technology trends by more efficiently exploiting increased circuit density through multi alu processing nodes and by minimizing and carefully managing required global communications to reduce the performance impact resulting from increasing wire delays it is very straightforward to build arithmetic units register files and memories and to replicate many of them on an integrated circuit however new architecture technology is required to efficiently and productively organize and control many arithmetic units on a chip in addition new agile memory management and event handling mechanisms are required to enable multiple simultaneously executing threads in particular the m machine project is focusing on the following issues multi alu node organization methods for controlling multi alu nodes cache organization for multi alu nodes memory protection for scalable computers memory resource management for scalable computers exception handling methods for multi alu nodes communication and synchronization mechanisms for scalable computers efficient network interfaces for scalable computers the m machine is designed to efficiently execute programs with any or all granularities of parallelism on the map multi alu processor the processing core of the m machine parallel instruction sequences h threads are run concurrently on the three clusters to exploit ilp across all 9 of the function units also they may be used to exploit loop level parallelism or fine grain thread level parallelism to exploit coarse grain thread level parallelism and to mask variable pipeline memory and communication delays the map interleaves the 9 wide instruction streams from different tasks v threads within each cluster on a cluster by cluster and cycle by cycle basis thus sharing the execution resources among all active tasks this arrangement of v threads vertical threads and h threads horizontal threads is summarized in the figure above five v threads are resident in the cluster register files each v thread consists of three h threads one on each cluster each h thread consists of a sequence of 3 wide instructions containing integer memory and floating point operations on each cluster the h threads from the different v threads are interleaved over the execution units the m machine architecture specifies 9 alus per node which would deliver 900 mips and 600mflops per node with a 100mhz clock the actual silicon implementation includes only 7 alu's per node 6 integer units and 1 floating point unit instead of 6 integer units and 3 floating point units due to chip area restrictions m machine design team the m machine team consists of hardware and software designers at mit stanford cadence spectrum design and caltech syracuse past members of the m machine design team include the microelectronics center of north carolina mcnc mit stanford william j dally whay sing lee steve keckler marco fillo andrew chang nick carter albert ma keith klayman dan hartman parag gupta andrew chen jeff bowers andrew shultz fletcher sandbeek scott rixner daniel maskit richard lethin yevgeny gurevich cadence spectrum design also see associated press release and success story scp lab at caltech syracuse university steve taylor bryan chow publications related publications papers theses technical reports & memos achang cva stanford edu
