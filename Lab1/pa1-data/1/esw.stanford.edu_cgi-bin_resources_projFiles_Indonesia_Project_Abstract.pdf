geohazards international page 1 conceptual design of an earthquake and tsunami resistant building in sumatra abstract the southwestern coast of sumatra and the mentawai islands offshore face the world's highest risk from tsunamis and a significant risk from earthquakes yet most of the vulnerable coastal communities in that area are unaware of their risk and of possible mitigation options some of these communities have launched preparedness and awareness efforts but much work remains to be done for example padang west sumatra indonesia has mapped evacuation routes and carried out evacuation drills but unfortunately the city's topography makes high ground especially difficult for much of the population to reach in the time between the tsunami warning and the arrival of the tsunami wave bengkulu a coastal city to the southeast of padang has not even begun to make evacuation plans geohazards international ghi and its alliance partners propose to assess the need for and feasibility of vertical evacuation structures as a key component of tsunami preparedness in these communities a vertical evacuation structure is designed to serve as a temporary refuge for evacuees during a tsunami its height exceeds the tsunami inundation level and its strength and resilience resist the tsunami and earthquake forces in this pilot project an interdisciplinary team would develop a conceptual design for such a structure in padang west sumatra indonesia this effort would involve geosciences engineering political and social science aspects it could provide the first step in making vertical evacuation structures a reality in these vulnerable communities potentially saving thousands of lives in the next tsunami
