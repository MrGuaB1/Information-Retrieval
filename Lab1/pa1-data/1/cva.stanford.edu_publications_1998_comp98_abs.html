m machine publications efficient protected message interface in the mit m machine abstract we present a user level message interface that provides high performance and very low processor overhead in this system messages are launched from within the user's general register file and received in a hardware queue mapped to a general register a message handler is started within the latency of a jump instruction upon arrival of the first message word up to 18x faster than conventional interrupt driven interfaces these tightly integrated mechanisms feature end to end latencies as low as nearly one quarter that of memory mapped interfaces copying is eliminated in these mechanisms reducing processor occupancy by up to one third when compared with other integrated register mapped systems the interface also features a low overhead robust protection model using virtually addressed message destinations and certified trusted handlers both are specified with unforgeable pointers enabling fine grain control over a user thread's accessible domain as well as its permitted remote operations we discuss the application of this system in the framework of the multithreaded mit m machine and show that unlike other approaches it is able to provide protection and avoid starvation while maintaining high efficiency
