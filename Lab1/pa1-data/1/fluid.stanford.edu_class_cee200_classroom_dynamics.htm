classroom dynamics what is a ta an example diversity foreign students women honor code sexual harassment copyright policy document reproduction resources home up classroom dynamics the structure of a class the ratio of men to women the gender and attitude of the instructor and the topic of the course itself can all influence students self assessments in classroom or lab situations the unconscious bias with which many classes are taught can be both enraging and discouraging to some women for instance a few years ago medical student julie switzer was listening to a lecture on muscle contractions of the uterus when the male professor addressed the class by saying you may never feel this but your wife will since women comprised 40 percent of the class switzer found herself wondering who the professor viewed as his audience other examples of gender bias in the classroom are less overt but are sometimes more insidious some women feel uncomfortable with the confrontational style in which classroom discussions are staged and feel tentative or awkward when asking a question or making a comment we feel excluded from discussions if professors don t call on us there are many reasons why we might feel this way and before we reprimand ourselves for lacking assertiveness or not having anything important to say we must realize that we probably have a reason for feeling the way we do one important thing to remember is that we as women are not the only ones who sometimes underestimate our abilities the unspoken and at times spoken assumption among some students and instructors that we as women are less qualified or competent than our male peers undermines our confidence in our academic abilities most women experience these phenomena to some degree we should be aware of unintentional bias or unconscious assumptions among classroom dynamics in this way we can learn to recognize patterns for what they are and know that our abilities are equal to those of our male classmates back up next for problems or questions regarding this web contact the webmistress kmay stanford edu last updated september 21 1999
