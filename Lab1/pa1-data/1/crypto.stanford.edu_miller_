miller's weil pairing algorithm miller's weil pairing algorithm history in 1986 victor miller described an algorithm for evaluating the weil pairing on an algebraic curve the paper has never been published but has nevertheless become the basis of many many follow on works in cryptography miller's algorithm is used to attack certain elliptic curve cryptosystems and has recently become the core of several new cryptosystems as a result miller's paper is a frequently cited unpublished manuscript the original unpublished manuscript is available for download below author v miller abstract the problem of deducing a function on an algebraic curve having a given divisor is important in the field of indefinite integration indeed it is the main computational step in determining whether an algebraic function possesses an indefinite integral it has also become important recently in the study of discrete elliptic logarithm in cryptography and in the construction of the new class of error correcting codes which exceed the varshamov gilbert bound it can also be used to give partial answer to a question raised by schoof in his paper on computing the exact number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field heretofore the best known algorithm for calculating such functions was exponential in the size of the input in this paper i give an algorithm which is linear in the size of the input if arithmetic in the field under consideration takes constant time for this algorithm it is necessary to represent the function as a straight line program for representation as a rational function may be exponential in the size of the input reference unpublished manuscript download paper pdf postscript help maintained by dan boneh
