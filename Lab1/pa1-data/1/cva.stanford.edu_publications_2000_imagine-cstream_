efficient conditional operations for data parallel architectures efficient conditional operations for data parallel architectures ujval kapasi william j dally scott rixner peter r mattson john d owens and brucek khailany stanford university computer systems laboratory appears in the proceedings of the 33rd annual international symposium on microarchitecture dec 10 13 2000 monterey ca pp 159 170 abstract many data parallel applications including emerging media applications have regular structures that can easily be expressed as a series of arithmetic kernels operating on data streams data parallel architectures are designed to exploit this regularity by performing the same operation on many data elements concurrently however applications containing data dependent control constructs perform poorly on these architectures conditional streams convert these constructs into data dependent data movement this allows data parallel architectures to efficiently execute applications with data dependent control flow essentially conditional streams extend the range of applications that a data parallel architecture can execute efficiently for example polygon rendering speeds up by a factor of 1.8 with the use of conditional streams paper adobe pdf format ujval kapasi
