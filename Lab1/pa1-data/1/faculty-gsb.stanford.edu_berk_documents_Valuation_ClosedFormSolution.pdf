continuous time closed form solution for the case without learning and  t non constant page 1 continuous time closed form solution for the case without learning and  t non constant addendum to valuation and return dynamics of new ventures by berk green and naik forthcoming review of financial studies when the success intensity is not constant but a known function of the stage alone  t n the bellman hamiliton jacobi equation becomes 1 2 x22 2 x2 v n x x x v n x rv n x u n x n v n 1 x v n x a bx 0 where u n x denotes the optimal investment rule this recursive system of ordinary differential equations is solved by starting with the terminal value and working backwards at each stage the solution involves several constant parameters and a number of constants for stage n that are defined recursively given the constants obtained solving the previous stage and the boundary conditions in corollary 2 in the main paper the next proposition states this solution proposition 1 when the success intensity at each stage is known to be n the value of the r&d project vn x is vn x n 1 i n fi nxi bnx gn x x n anx x x n 1 where  2 2 8r2 2 2 2 22 n 2 2 8 r+ n 2 2 2 2 22 gn gn 1 a n 1 r n bn bn 1 b n 1 r  n fi n 0 i n n n i fi n 1 n i n x n n n r  bnx n rgn n 1 i n 1 i x n i fi n i n 1 page 2 an x n  n n r  n bnx n rngn n 1 i n 1 in ni x n i fi n and x n solves the following equation 1 1  r  1 n  n bnx n 1 r 1 n  n gn n 1 i n 1 i  i 1 n  n 1 x n i fi n the constants are solved for recursively subject to the following two bound ary conditions gn 0 bn 1 r  the proof of this proposition follows exactly the same logic as the proof of proposition 7 in the main paper 2
