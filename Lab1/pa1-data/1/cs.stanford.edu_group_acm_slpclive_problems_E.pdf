e empty triangles page 1 e empty triangles figure 1 four lines making two empty triangles shaded do you know how easy it is to make a very simple problem into a brutally hard one here is an example how many triangles can you make with n straight lines in the plane as long as they have different slopes and no three of them meet at a single point there will be n 3 triangles which is the maximum possible you can get okay that wasn t too bad but let's see what happens if we only count triangles that are empty that is none of the lines pass through the interior of the triangle then the number of triangles suddenly becomes very small for example with 4 straight lines we can only make 2 empty triangles whereas the to tal number of triangles can be as big as 4 refer to the dia gram in fact a general formula for the maximum number of empty triangles that can be drawn with n lines is not known the hard part however is to find the right configuration of the lines your job is much easier given n straight lines on the plane count the number of empty triangles e 1 input the input consists of multiple test cases each test case begins with a line containing an integer n 1 n 500 which indicates the number of lines on the plane the next n lines each contain four integers x1 y1 x2 and y2 between 1000 and 1000 representing a straight line that goes through x1 y1 and x2 y2 it is guaranteed that no three lines meet at the same point and all the lines are distinct the input terminates with a line with n 0 for example 4 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 5 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 1 2 0 3 1 3 0 4 1 4 0 e 2 output for each test case print out a single line that contains the number of empty triangles formed by the given lines for example the correct output for the sample input above would be 2 0 11
