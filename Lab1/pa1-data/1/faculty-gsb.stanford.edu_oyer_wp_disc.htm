discretion in executive incentive contracts theory and evidence discretion in executive incentive contracts by kevin j murphy and paul oyer june 2003 abstract we analyze the costs and benefits of subjective performance evaluation of executives relative to objective performance measures we formulate hypotheses based on the theoretical work on discretionary compensation and test these hypotheses empirically using a proprietary dataset of executive bonus plans we show that discretion is less important in determining ceo pay than the pay of other executives we also find that discretion is relatively important at larger and private firms and that more diversified firms are less likely to compensate business unit managers based on firm wide performance finally we consider and largely dismiss tax related explanations for our results back to paul oyer's page
