miscellaneous mathematics a limerick my notes miscellaneous mathematics notation galois theory roots of unity vandermonde determinant a limerick a limerick found on several maths humour sites now rendered in mathml for your viewing pleasure &integral 1 3 3 z 2 dz cos 3  9 log e 3 integral z squared dz from one to the cube root of three times the cosine of three pi on nine equals log the cube root of e more limericks when procrastinating as an undergrad i d occasionally compose limericks recently i found some in an old text file when one is writing a thesis as the remaining time decreases one eats and sleeps less and suffers so much stress that all rational thought just ceases said the donut to the cup isn t it magnificent although we seem very different from a topologist's view i m related to you because we re homotopically equivalent i think i ll need a lobotomy after all this algebraic topology for every object i face becomes a hausdorff space and i ll compute its singular homology i don t understand all of them anymore my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
