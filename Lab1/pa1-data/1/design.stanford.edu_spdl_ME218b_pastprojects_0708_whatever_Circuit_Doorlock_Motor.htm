home home back schematic diagram of the circuit design calculation the measured resistance of door lock motor was about 2 ohm therefore supplying 5v the current becomes 5v 2ohm 2.5 a regarding that the peak output current of l293b is 2a the current flowing inside the motor is slightly over 2a but it does not occur any problem because the motor will be used just for several seconds voltage regulator lm7805 was used to regulate the voltage from 14v to 5v 7805's peak output current is 2.5 a when the voltage difference between the input and the output is 9v 14 5 9v therefore 7805 can supply enough current for door lock motor home back top
