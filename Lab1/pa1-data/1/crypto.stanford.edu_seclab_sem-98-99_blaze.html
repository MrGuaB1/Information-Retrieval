atomic proxy cryptography matt blaze at&t shannon laboratory this talk introduces atomic proxy cryptography in which an atomic proxy function in conjunction with a public proxy key converts ciphertext messages in a public key encryption scheme or signatures in a digital signature scheme for one key k_1 into ciphertext for another k_2 proxy keys once generated may be made public and proxy functions applied in untrusted environments various kinds of proxy functions might exist em symmetric atomic proxy functions assume that the holder of k_2 unconditionally trusts the holder of k_1 while em asymmetric proxy functions do not it is not clear whether proxy functions exist for previous public key cryptosystems several new public key cryptosystems with symmetric proxy functions are described an encryption scheme which is at least as secure as diffie hellman an identification scheme which is at least as secure as the discrete log and a signature scheme derived from the identification scheme via a hash function full paper available this is joint work with martin strauss matt blaze atomic proxy cryptography gates 498 10 20 98 4 15 pm
