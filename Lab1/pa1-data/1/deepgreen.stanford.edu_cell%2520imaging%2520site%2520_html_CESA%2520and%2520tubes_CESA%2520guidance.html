testing the microfibril guidance hypothesis dynamic imaging of cellulose synthase a long standing hypothesis is that the cortical microtubule array guides plant cell morphogensis by directing the orientation of cellulose deposition in the cell wall this idea has been supported by many experiments including disruption of the cortical array by drug treatment or mutation and assay of cellulose orientation by polarization microscopy or em techniques such as fesem however these techniques do not allow the dynamic relationship between cellulose synthase complexes and the cytoskleton to be evaluated and they have not satifactorily revealed the relationship of individual components of the cortical cytoskeleton to the deposition individual microfibrils to address these questions and to test the microfibril guidance hypothesis we created a functional fluorescent protein fusion to cesa6 a catalytic subunit of the cellulose synthase complex and imaged this tagged protein in growing arabidopsis cells imaging of tagged protein motility provides an assay for the orientation and rate of cellulose biosynthesis at the level of single biosynthetic complexes science paper images and movies cell wall biogenesis cesa dynamics and trafficking subcellular tag screen cytoskeletal dynamics cellulose synthase dynamics cytokinesis gallery vectors equipment and protocols links people home copyright sean cutler and david ehrhardt all rights reserved site designed and maintained by david ehrhardt
