michael levitt's palm pilot michael levitt's latest pda may 2004 i have been a fan of the palm pilot pda's since the beginning of 1997 at one time i became quite addicted to it and would do nothing that was not listed first now i am happy to use it as a great efficiency tool this is my fifth or sixth pda and is most advanced with a built in camera mp3 player and wifi i find the camera more useful than i expected and the wifi much less useful than i expected the sony clie peg tj37 uses the palm os5 whereas my previous pda's used os2 os3 and os4 at first the need to use grafitti 2 drove me crazy but by the time i had downloaded the grafitti 1 software i was quite used to grafitti 2 i do wish that a few of the best grafitti 1 short cuts were still recognized gamma for x 90 degree rotated gamma for k and backward vee for v with more memory and a 256 mb memory stick i use the clie to store maps word documents with wordsmith and a few mp3 songs i tried a lot of different map programs and found them generally unsatisfactory except for the tube street map of paris instead i scan good quality paper maps and add them in as images that can be easily panned and zoomed with the built in image viewing software one big problem of os5 is that tomtom city maps are not supported copyright michael levitt updated may 2004
