elliptic curves field of rational functions my notes elliptic curves overview the weierstrass form group of points explicit addition formulae field of rational functions zeroes and poles rational maps torsion points the weil pairing the weil pairing ii counting points hyperelliptic curves computing the tate pairing the mov attack points of trace zero field of rational functions let e k be an elliptic curve with equation f x y 0 the following is true for any affine curve take a polynomial g x y and consider its behaviour on the points of e k only ignoring its behaviour on all other values of x and y then for example if g f from our point of view g is the same as the zero function because g p for any point p on the curve is zero in fact it can be shown using hilbert's nullstellensatz that a polynomial g is the zero function on e if and only if it is a multiple of f this leads us to define the ring of regular functions of e to be k e k x y &langle f &rangle its field of fractions k e is called the field of rational functions of e if we write e in weierstrass form then we can always replace y 2 with smaller powers of y meaning that a regular function can always be written in the form v x y w x fact every nonconstant regular function has at least two finite zeroes my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
