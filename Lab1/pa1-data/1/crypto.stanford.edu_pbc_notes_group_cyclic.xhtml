group theory cyclic groups my notes group theory groups lagrange's theorem cyclic groups generators groups up to order eight the product theorem permutations geometry and groups normal subgroups quotient groups the isomorphism theorems jordan holder decomposition sylow groups abelian groups finitely generated abelian groups generators and relations cyclic groups a cyclic group g is a group that can be generated by a single element a so that every element in g has the form a i for some integer i we denote the cyclic group of order n by &zopf n since the additive group of &zopf n is a cyclic group of order n theorem all subgroups of a cyclic group are cyclic if g &langle a &rangle is cyclic then for every divisor d of &verticalbar g &verticalbar there exists exactly one subgroup of order d which may be generated by a &verticalbar g &verticalbar d proof let &verticalbar g &verticalbar d n then 1 a n a 2 n a d 1 n are distinct and form a cyclic subgroup &langle a n &rangle of order d conversely let h 1 a 1 a d 1 be a subgroup of g for some d dividing g then for all i a i a k for some k and since every element has order dividing &verticalbar h &verticalbar a i d a k d 1 thus k d &verticalbar g &verticalbar m n d m for some m and we have a i a n m so each a i is in fact a power of a n from above this means it must be one of the d subgroups already described theorem every group of composite order has proper subgroups proof let g be a group of composite order and let 1 a &element g then if &langle a &rangle g we are done otherwise the subgroup &langle a d &rangle g for every divisor d of &verticalbar g &verticalbar my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
