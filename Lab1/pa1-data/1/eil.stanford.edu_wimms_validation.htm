welcome to wireless modular monitoring systems eil engineering informatics group stanford university overview proof of concept system validation tests publications presentations people validation tests multiple laboratory validation experiments were first conducted to verify the performance of the prototype wireless structural monitoring system the experiments were completed upon a simple 3 story aluminum structure mounted on a single dof shaking table close match was found between the theoretical values and experimental values during the tests regarding to both structural properties and dynamic responses through collaboration with prof chung bang yun at korean advanced institute of science and technology kaist large scale field validation tests were completed at geumdang bridge in icheon south korea tens of wireless sensing devices were deployed along the concrete box girder bridge spanning 122m the bridge has also been instrumented with a high quality cable based monitoring system for baseline validation through collaboration with prof chin hsiung loh at national taiwan university our prototype wireless monitoring system was instrumented on a real size laboratory structure a 6 dof large scale shaking table in national center for research on earthquake engineering ncree taiwan is used to excite the structure with various ground motions data acquisition and onboard computation capabilities of the wireless monitoring system were validated through the tests video clip mpg 30.2 mb of a large scale shaking table experiment is available online the structure was excited by chi chi tcu82 earthquake record scaled to a peak acceleration of 10m s 2 if your video player does not play properly please try installing mpeg2 decoder
