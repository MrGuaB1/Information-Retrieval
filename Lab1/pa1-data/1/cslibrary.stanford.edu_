stanford cs ed library stanford cs education library this online library collects education cs material from stanford courses and distributes them for free update 2006 for learning code concepts java strings loops arrays check out nick's experimental javabat com server where you can type in little code puzzles and get immediate feedback pointers and memory videos and materials on basic pointers lists and trees basic and advanced materials on linked lists and binary trees languages the c and perl languages unix using unix tetris materials for tetris experiments help with downloading if you think the cs education library is useful please link to it at http cslibrary stanford edu pointers and memory binky pointer video picture from video a silly but memorable 3 minute animated video demonstrating the basic structure techniques and pitfalls of using pointers there are separate versions of the video for c java c++ pascal and ada there is also a more traditional companion text below that goes with the video and a brief history of how the video was made pointer basics the companion text for the binky video presents the same concepts and examples as the video and includes study questions with solutions code is presented in c java c++ and pascal pointers and memory a 31 page explanation of everything you ever wanted to know about pointers and memory can be used as an introduction or as review for people who mostly understand pointers mostly uses c with some discussion of c++ and java the early sections introduce basic pointer concepts while the later sections discuss more advanced topics such as reference pointers and dynamic arrays lists and trees linked list basics a 26 page introduction to the techniques and code for building linked lists in c includes basic examples and sample problems with solutions provides a basic understanding of linked lists and pointer code linked list problems a quick review of linked list basics followed by 18 linked list problems with solutions the problems range from beginner to intermediate to advanced an excellent source of pointer algorithm problems binary trees a 27 page introduction to binary trees introduces the basic concepts of binary trees and then works through a series of practice problems with solution code in c c++ and java binary trees have an elegant recursive structure so they make a good introduction to recursive pointer algorithms the great tree list recursion problem one of the neatest pointer recursion problems you will ever see this is an advanced problem that uses linked lists binary trees and recursion includes solution code in java and c languages essential perl a quick 23 page introduction to the main features of the perl language handy as an introduction or a quick reference essential c a relatively quick 45 page discussion of most of the practical aspects of programming in c explains types variables operators functions control constructs arrays pointers strings array pointer trickery and the standard library functions the coverage is complete but quick so it is most appropriate for someone with some programming experience revised 4 2003 unix unix programming tools a 16 page introduction to the most common unix tools and their usage in the compile link debug process introduces gcc make gdb emacs and the shell there should be enough information here to allow someone with a little unix experience to build and debug tetris stanford tetris project complete programming materials for a tetris assignment including a game playing ai a runnable version is included along with sufficient materials for people to attempt the project presented at the nifty assignments panel at sig cse 2001 beta materials much of the current materials existed earlier in rough form as handouts for stanford cs courses you can dig through some of those rough materials yourself at stanford cse home to many stanford courses and the nifty assignments archive cs1 cs2 cs1 2 accelerated advanced programming internet programming please send your comments to nick parlante cs stanford edu
