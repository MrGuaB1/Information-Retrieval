kookint home research bmg and structural materials modeling and simulation biomaterials thin films and nanomaterials toughening of nanoporous organic inorganic hybrid materials debonding under fatigue loading at polymer inorganic interfaces mechanics and fracture of patterned device structures reliability of microelectronic devices packaging reliability polymer interface adhesion solder ball attach reliability adhesion of silica filled epoxy underfill die attach reliability people alumni publications courses seminar schedule interface reliability in microelectronic packaging the objective of our work is not only to measure and characterize the critical interfacial fracture energy but also to study subcritical crack growth behavior under selected environmental and loading conditions chosen to reflect more realistic in service thermo mechanistic models describing interface fracture behavior in terms of local interface structure and chemistry it will provide guidelines for interface engineering strategies and processing solutions for promoting strength toughness and resistance to subcritical time or loading cycle dependent debonding at or near to bi material interfaces as an example a multi layer structure in semiconductor packaging is schematically illustrated where metals and polymers are often found bonded together within microchips and their packages debonding of an interface between the copper heat sink and the polymer heat sink attach is shown in the inset in our research we are exploring the micromechanisms that contribute to interface debonding department of materials science and engineering stanford university back to top
