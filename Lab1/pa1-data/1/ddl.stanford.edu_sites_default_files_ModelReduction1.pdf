a lyapunov function approach to energy based model reduction page 1 a lyapunov function approach to energy based model reduction page 2 menu why model reduction lyapunov functions mass spring damper example tie into sam's talk page 3 model reduction automated model reduction techniques create complex models engineers are lazy heuristic model reduction requires experience and it is difficult or impossible to quantify the reduction tradeoffs page 4 lyapunov functions are our friends laypunov complicated system scaler value r r k f 2 2 2 1 2 1 kx xm e d page 5 lyapunov functions are bowls page 6 vector norms page 7 canonical example page 8 pendulum example page 9 problem negative semidefinite page 10 some math x x m k xx kx xm d d d 0 0 2 1 2 1 2 2 x x b xxxbxmxxkxe d d d dd d d 0 00 page 11 converse lyapunov look for an exponential xx kx xm w d d  2 2 2 1 2 1 w w  d 2 b  m b  page 12 mostly energy function page 13 nonlinear systems nonlinear systems are more difficult to analyze is there a physical generalization from linear to nonlinear page 14 sam's talk quantifies the reduction for damped mechanical systems bounded force bounded state this generates a constant ellipsoid of possible state deviation from the simplified model page 15 bounded input bounded state page 16 recap & conclusion automated models are too complex lyapunov functionals are our friends energy is not an ideal lyapunov function but it can be tweaked in the linear case math is actually cool
