mpeg encoding imagine architecture programming performance vlsi board applications tools depth mpeg rendering mpeg encoding the imagine stream programming model applies several kernels to an incoming video stream to generate mpeg 2 compressed video the kernels in the compressor are color conversion motion estimation discrete cosine transform quantization run length encoding variable length coding idctq correlation for reference frame figure 1 shows how the mpeg 2 compression algorithm is mapped onto the imagine figure 1 mapping mpeg 2 onto imagine stream model performance cycle accurate simulations of imagine show the high performance that can be achieved on mpeg 2 compression raw speed measurements are for 360x288 images 24 bit 350 frames per second for 720x480 images 24 bit 105 frames per second overall the imagine achieves 18.3 gops with a power efficiency of 8.3 gops w gajh cva stanford edu
