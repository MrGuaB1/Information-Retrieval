data privacy sachin lodha trddc there is an inherent trade off between the utility that databases can offer and the privacy they afford to their constituents as a part of our algorithmic and theoretical researches in data privacy we are studying this trade off formally attempting to understand the relationship between privacy and utility on a practical side we are also building an industrial scale product in this domain that can address the real world problems in this talk i will mention some important scenarios in this arena point out a few open problems and discuss our jabs at them i will also introduce masketeer our data masking product that can be useful in generating test beds from production data biography sachin lodha did his undergraduate studies in computer science and engineering at indian institute of technology bombay between 1992 96 he got his phd under professor endre szemer 350di at rutgers in 2002 since then sachin is working as a scientist at tata research development and design centre trddc a research unit of tata consultancy services ltd he is broadly interested in the design and analysis of algorithms with an emphasis on on line algorithms and approximation algorithms graph theory and combinatorics currently he is heading research in data privacy at trddc where the ultimate goal is to find solutions that provide the right balance between the extremes of fully disclosed and completely withheld data 27 february monday at 1630 hrs gates 4b opposite 490
