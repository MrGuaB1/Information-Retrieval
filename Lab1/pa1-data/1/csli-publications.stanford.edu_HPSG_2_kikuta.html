clausal complement or adverbial clause toward an integral account of the japanese internally headed relative clause clausal complement or adverbial clause toward an integral account of the japanese internally headed relative clause chiharu uda kikuta doshisha university kyoto this paper proposes a constraint based comprehensive analysis of the internally headed relative clause ihrc in japanese which is able to accommodate the synchronic properties as well as the diachronic change that ihrc went through this paper claims that ihrc should be defined as a special type of non head daughter of the main predicate the predicate is subcategorized for a clause while it calls for an entity like argument the multi level architecture of hpsg accommodates the apparent syntax semantic mismatch the ihrc is syntactically a clausal complement while it is not semantically selected by the main predicate the main predicate on the other hand selects an entity as its argument but the entity is not syntactically given i claim that the syntax of ihrc specifies this much the rest or the actual linkage between the predicate and the semantically required target entity is semantically or pragmatically achieved drawing on the ideas of argument realization and argument extension with the postulation of the interface level dependents proposed in bouma et al 2001 i have demonstrated how the present proposal can connect the clausal complement ihrc and adverbial clauses thus providing the structural aspect of the motivation for the diachronic change
