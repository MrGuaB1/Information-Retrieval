newsletter dge newsletter august 2004 outreach on august 16 a study was published in the online version of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that had been submitted by chris field and included three other members of our department kim cahill elsa cleland and claire lunch among its authors the paper emissions pathways climate change and impacts on california generated news releases from the ny times ciw in washington and our local universities dr greg asner and two members of his lab group amanda cooper and david knapp attended the 3rd science conference of the large scale biosphere atmosphere experiment in amazonia lba held in brasilia brazil july 27 29 2004 asner gave a presentation in the plenary session entitled remote sensing of selective logging challenges successes and the future the presentation described the history of techniques that have been used to detect selective logging in the amazon and the latest progress that has been made with modern sensors since selective logging is a major land use in the amazon region it is important to identify its location and extent in order to understand its ecological impact in a special session on disturbance events and forest ecology asner also gave a presentation entitled amazon wide gap fraction and selective logging from satellite analyses this presentation described how the asner lab is using satellite sensors with an automated monte carlo unmixing automcu algorithm to determine gap fraction allowing for improved quantification of carbon stocks amanda cooper and david knapp each presented posters at the conference amanda's entitled method for large scale mapping of forest canopy damage in amazonia outlined the process by which satellite imagery is processed with the automcu methodology to create maps of canopy damage david's was entitled sensitivity of automated monte carlo unmixing to surface reflectance uncertainties caused by aerosols water vapor and terrain slope aspect this poster quantified the uncertainties in automcu output based on changes in atmospheric aerosols water vapor and terrain using the 6s radiative transfer model of the atmosphere kim cahill is working at the nature conservancy in california this summer studying the ecological impacts of vineyard development and the potential for sustainable vineyard management practices to promote biodiversity this project stems from to her work last year with chris on the effect of climate change on california agriculture particularly grapes the second most valuable agricultural commodity in the state members leaving lydia olander starts her aaas congressional science policy fellowship in september after she arrives in washington she will go through an orientation and then find a congressional office to work in she may work in the office of a senator representative or committee her role with be to help interpret and explain the current state of our scientific understanding on subjects of concern to constituents and policy makers lydia may be required to address any area of science andrew elmore has completed his post doc with us and will be a professor at dartmouth college in the dept of earth sciences amanda cooper has moved to the university of central florida orlando fl she will be doing a phd under john weishampel at ucf's geospatial analysis and modeling of ecosystems lab and sarah robinson has also left new members dan pendleton is our newest arrival working in asner's group he recently received his ms from cornell univ in crop & soils science but was really from applied mathematics here he will be working on pattern recognition in the brazilian rainforest guanghui lin recently joined berry's group as a visiting scholar for the next six months dr lin came from china in 1988 for phd studies at the univ of miami florida he was with the biosphere 2 center of columbia univ arizona now closed but also is research professor and team leader at the institute of botany cas beijing his research interests include stable isotopic studies of possible mechanisms responsible for plant adaptation to contrasting environments and for ecosystem process response to global change editor jan brown e mail jbrown globalecology stanford edu archives and pdf archives of past newsletters and recent events
