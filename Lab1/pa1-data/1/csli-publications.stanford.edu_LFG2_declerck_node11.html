the resulting type system next up previous next concluding remarks concerning the up no title previous structure rules the resulting type system the resulting type system from the migration is here only partly displayed and will not been commented it should be enough to say that i also recurred to the use of templates in the lfg source grammar in order to design the type system the reader will see that features may have distinct types of values this is also something which can complicate the migration since in order to describe an efficient alep grammar one has to make choices upon the various types of values allowed in dependence of the phenomenon he she wants to account for this diversity of kind of types is not present in the lfg source grammar which thus gives no hint for a decision concerning the type of values to be optimally chosen the inheritance relations are encoded with the sign the inheritance relation is also something which is to be designed in a second step once the lfg source grammar has been migrated type sign syn type syntax sem type semantic spec type specifier refined atom y n string list rest list syntax n_syntax d_syntax a_syntax st_a_syntax a_nom_syntax st_syntax p_syntax p_obj_syntax p_adj_syntax t_syntax type syntax agr boolean nom acc dat gen fem mas neut sg pl p1 p2 p3 weak strong gaps type gap_lists type d_syntax cat atom det d1 dp e fcomp list type sign ehf atom yes no type n_syntax cat atom noun n_app n1 n2 np type p_syntax cat atom p pp pdet atom yes no type p_obj_syntax obj list type sign pcase atom thierry declerck sat sep 6 17 29 07 met dst 1997
