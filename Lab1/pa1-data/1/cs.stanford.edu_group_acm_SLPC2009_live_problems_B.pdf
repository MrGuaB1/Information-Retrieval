b fruit bowl fruit c cc java page 1 b fruit bowl fruit c cc java b 1 description for her next project beebe flat wishes to paint a bowl of fruit naturally the bowl is two dimensional as is all of the fruit she bought a triangular bowl which somehow always manages to stay upright with a perfectly level top the bowl has a height h and opens a degrees to the left and b degrees to the right see diagram in the interest of art beebe eschews symmetry so a b she plans to buy perfectly circular fruit each with radius 1 to put into the bowl however perfectly circular fruit is expensive so she needs your help to figure out how much fruit she has to buy she plans to fill the bowl to the brim adding as much fruit as possible without any part exceeding the height of the bowl thankfully she is not interested in an optimal packing since she wants a simple algorithm for actually arranging the fruit she will place the fruit one at a time each time choosing the lowest possible location for the center since beebe doesn t like to deal with ties she always pur chases a bowl such that there is only one lowest possible lo cation within a margin of 10 5 finally to ensure that a lid will fit nicely on the bowl when she's done painting she only chooses bowls such that when properly packed the last piece of fruit to fit will be at least 10 2 below the top and the next piece of fruit that would fit if the bowl were taller will jut out at least 10 2 above the top given a particular bowl how many pieces of fruit does beebe need to buy to fill the bowl in this manner b 2 input the input consists of multiple test cases each test case has three integers on a single line denoting a b and h 1 a b 45 a b and 1 h 300 the last test case will be followed by a b h 0 which should not be processed for example 20 30 10 10 20 20 0 0 0 b 3 output for each test case print on a single line the number of pieces of fruit that beebe needs to buy to fill the given bowl for example 9 25 7
