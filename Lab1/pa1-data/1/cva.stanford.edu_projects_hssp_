home members status publications links principal investigator william j dally with technology scaling off chip communication has become the bottleneck for system performance to overcome this bottleneck we have developed several high speed signaling techniques for off chip communication we developed the first simultaneous bi directional i o pads 1990 the first equalized high speed cmos link using transmit pre emphasis 1996 the first low power area efficient high speed cmos serial link transceiver 2000 and the fastest 20gb s fully integrated cmos transmitter to date 2003 future work involves crosstalk cancellation between parallel i o links and a complete low power area 20gb s 0.13 um cmos transceiver research topics include serial link and parallel link i o circuit design phase locked loops plls and delay locked loops dlls circuit design timing acquisition channel coding equalization low power circuit design this project is supported by defense advanced research projects agency and intel corporation for problems or questions regarding this web contact patrick chiang last updated april 1 2005
