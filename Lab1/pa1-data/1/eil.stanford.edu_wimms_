welcome to wireless modular monitoring systems eil engineering informatics group stanford university overview proof of concept system validation tests publications presentations people overview imagine a world in which structures have the ability to self diagnose locations of long term structural deterioration warn inhabitants of eminent collapse during large seismic events and even assess damage in real time from an external disturbance such as an earthquake while such a world sounds like it is from a science fiction novel it is on the brink of realization the engineering informatics group at stanford university is currently involved in cutting edge research aimed to make advanced structural monitoring systems a reality the key ingredients to this project are in place ideas technology and initiative by drawing upon advances made during the recent boom in the technological worlds of wireless communications micro electro mechanical systems mems and integrated circuits a low cost modular structural monitoring system can now be designed in systems used to date a strong dependence upon a wired infrastructure renders them expensive to install in addition such systems impose a centralized approach to acquiring system measurements the proposed novel wireless monitoring system will give system engineers ultimate freedom in designing their systems and an opportunity to back away from the centralized approach this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant number 9988909 any opinions findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author s and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation
