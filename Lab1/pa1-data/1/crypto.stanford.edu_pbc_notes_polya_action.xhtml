polya theory group actions my notes polya theory group actions burnside's lemma the cycle index polynomial polya's inventory theorem group actions let  be the set of all colourings of a necklace for example with 3 colours and 6 beads we have &verticalbar  &verticalbar 3 6 let  &element  be a colouring of a necklace such as rgbrgb and g be an element of its symmetry group g such as the reflection that takes 123456 to 654321 where we have numbered the beads from 1 to 6 then write g  to mean the resulting colouring after applying g to  in our example g  bgrbgr this defines a group action on the necklace group actions can be defined more formally define the orbit of  as orb g  g  g &element g that is the colourings you get when you rotate and reflect the necklace for example orb g rgbrgb rgbrgb gbrgbr brgbrg bgrbgr rbgrbg grbgrb each orbit contains colourings that we consider to be the same a suitable rotation or reflection moves from one colouring to another distinct orbits represent distinct patterns on our necklace that is given a colouring in one orbit it is impossible to reach a colouring in another orbit via rotation or reflection hence in our new terminology the problem is now to find the number of orbits define the stabilizer of  as g  g &element g g   that is the rotations and reflections that preserve a given colouring for example if r is the rotation that takes 123456 to 234561 then g rgbrgb 1 r 3 where 1 is the identity element of g observe g  is a group by considering its left or right cosets for any  we have &verticalbar g  &verticalbar &verticalbar orb g  &verticalbar &verticalbar g &verticalbar compare with lagrange's theorem my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
