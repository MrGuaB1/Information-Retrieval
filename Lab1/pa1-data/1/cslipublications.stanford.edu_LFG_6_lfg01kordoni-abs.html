kordoni lfg01 abstract optimal linking for modern greek psych verb constructions valia kordoni abstract proceedings of lfg01 csli publications on line this paper focuses on the semantic properties and the syntactic behaviour of mg espvcs like the following i maria fovate tis kategides the maria n fear 3s the storms a mary is afraid of the storms i maria fovate me tis kategides the maria n fear 3s with the storms mary is afraid of the storms i maria n fovate ton giani the maria n fear 3s the john a mary is afraid of john i maria n fovate me ton giani the maria n fear 3s with the john a mary is afraid of john we account for the semantic and syntactic properties of the constructions in 1 4 by relying on the linking architecture that butt dalrymple and frank 1997 have proposed as an alternative to the fully deterministic principles of standard lmt we show that the optimal linking theory makes the correct predictions for the linking of the expr experiencer and the expd experienced semantic arguments of modern greek mg experiencer subject psych verb constructions espvcs and predicts that the variant of mg espvcs which realizes syntactically the expd experienced semantic argument as an accusative np examples 1 and 3 ranks higher is more optimal than the variant which realizes syntactically the expd experienced semantic argument as the complement of a pp phrase examples 2 and 4 this ranking reflects in a way the fact that in order to express the meaning mary is afraid of the storms native speakers prefer the construction in 1 rather than the one in 2 which is also mirrored in the rate of the marked variant of mg espvcs 2 and 4 in the greek eci corpus 5568
