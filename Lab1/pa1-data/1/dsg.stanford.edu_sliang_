sam liang home page sam liang sliang at dsg dot stanford dot edu i finished my ph d degree from stanford university i conducted computer network research in the distributed system group led by professor david cheriton research projects i have been working on tcp rtm real time mode which extends tcp to support real time applications such as audio video streaming we recently submitted a paper to icnp 2002 titled tcp rtm using tcp for real time applications i have also extended tcp to support multicast applications either reliable or semi reliable with tcp rtm a paper on this topic is published in infocom 2002 titled tcp smo extending tcp for medium scale multicast applications ph d dissertation unifying the transport layer of a packet switched internetwork before focusing on tcp i made wrap an important component of the triad project work based on the initial implementation by chetan rai now you can use wrap to communicate with a host in a different address realm in triad a host is identified by its name instead of ip address which is not unique across address realms and tcp checksum is based on the names of the endhosts running tcp rtm smo over http a lot of internet architecture is optimized for http such as firewalls dos prevention authentication etc if tcp and http can support video delivery smoothly it's a big win as it leverages the existing infrastructure to meet a lot of common requirements without the need to rebuild these functionalities for a new protocol a major advantage of using tcp rtm is to stream real time multimedia streams over http http runs on tcp traditionally it's not fit to stream real time voice or video over http due to the concern of potential long delay introduced by tcp's full reliability however with rtm this concern is elimintated source code for tcp rtm and tcp smo the tcp rtm and smo extensions are implemented in linux kernel 2.2 you are welcome to download the source code below port it to the latest linux kernel or other platforms and make further enhancements the source code is under gnu general public license please share with us your questions comments new experiment results tcp smo tar gz the implementation of rtm and smo in linux kernel tcpm tools tar gz some testing tools such as the sender and receiver programs phoneserver pdf a report to evaluate the quality improvement when using rtm to support voice over ip the kernel modification is under net ipv4 after you untar tcpm smo tar gz search for rtm and config_tcp_multicast user level tcp rtm smo another issue to investigate is to implement tcp rtm on the client side on the user level if we can do it on the user level on the client side then it does not require kernel level modification to deploy tcp rtm there are a number of attempts to do user level tcp for example http www usenix org events usits99 full_papers savage savage_html node15 html http www cs northwestern edu pdinda minet past projects in my previous life i did research on graphical user interface software visualization and computer graphics if you have a vrml plugin installed in your browser you can view this macarena dancer with a quicktime plugin you can get a panoramic view of the stanford robotics lab based on data obtained by a laser scanner i reconstructed the interior of a corner of the robotics lab click here to see some cool picture my real time ray tracer won an honorable mention award in the annual stanford rendering competition we all know that ray tracing is very time consuming doing it in real time is hard to believe the mpeg movie in the web page doesn t capture the excitement of the actual animation if you are interested ask me to show you the actual animation it's reall cool links to more cool computer graphics projects of mine will be added later work experience senior software engineer and architect tropos networks wireless mesh networks metro wifi networks senior software engineer worked on vlsi cad systems member of technical staff silicon graphics inc worked on sgi's c++ debugger and in particular a special debugger for x motif programs education ph d in ee stanford university ms in ee stanford university ms in cs university of arizona bs in cs beijing university
