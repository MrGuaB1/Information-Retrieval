number theory cyclotomic equations my notes number theory overview modular arithmetic euclid's algorithm division the chinese remainder theorem roots of polynomials units and the totient function modular exponentiation the order of a unit primality tests generators cyclic groups quadratic residues bonus section gauss lemma quadratic reciprocity carmichael numbers multiplicative functions mobius inversion generators the general case cyclotomic equations the heptadecagon eisenstein's irreducibility criterion gaussian periods roots of unity cyclotomic equations we try to solve the cyclotomic equation x p 1 x 1 x p 1 x p 2 1 0 algebraically transcendentally we know the roots are e 2  i k p for k 0 p 1 it can be easily shown that if gcd m n 1 then a primitive m th root of unity times a primitive n th root of unity is a primitive m n th root of unity thus we need only consider prime powers but then if  is a primitive p th root of unity then  k is a primitive p k th root of unity so we need only consider the case where p is prime in general we can use gauss method but let us see how far elementary methods lead us p 3 we merely solve the quadratic x 2 x 1 0 to obtain x 1 &pm i 3 2 p 5 we could solve the quartic x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 0 but since it is palindromic we make the variable substitution y x 1 x and solve y 2 y 1 0 to find y 1 &pm 5 2 and x 2 y x 1 0 implies x y &pm y 2 4 2 giving the four solutions x 5 1 &pm 2 5 10 4 5 1 &pm 2 5 10 4 p 7 the palindrome yields a cubic which can be solved for x p 11 the palindrome yields a quintic now elementary methods fail us and we need resort to gauss method as vandermonde did my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
