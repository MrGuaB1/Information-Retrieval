department of global ecology landscaping dge events in 2004 landscaping work party on saturday february 14th over 60 people helped plant over 5000 plants around the new dge building after a couple of postponements the weather cooperated and gave us a nearly perfect day chris and nona had made detailed plot maps of the area that showed where each species of native grass shrub or tree should be planted the required number of each type in pots or flats had been delivered paul organized the heavy equipment needed to breakup the adobe soil and mix it with finer stuff rototillers and posthole diggers continued to be used throughout the day gloves trowels and spades were handed to volunteers as they arrived and were directed to the planting areas naturally sustenance was needed to keep energy levels up this too was well organized with a catering van arriving at 11 30 to set up a burrito assembly line outside the seminar room hungry workers passed by the tables heaping their tortillas with warm beans rice cheese and meat before topping them off with sour cream guacamole onions & salsa plus chips very efficient and delicious although relaxing in the sunshine was tempting everyone soon went back to planting while paul saw that the lunch debris was sacked up although as chris wrote to the volunteers on monday the area looks spectacular there's more to be done and touch up crews will be needed over the next several weekends hope to see you on site organizers chris & nona plants arrived getting started planting continued on saturday feb 21
