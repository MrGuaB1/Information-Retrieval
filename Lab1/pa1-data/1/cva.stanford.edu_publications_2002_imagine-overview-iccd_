the imagine stream processor the imagine stream processor ujval kapasi william j dally scott rixner john d owens and brucek khailany stanford university computer systems laboratory appears in the proceedings of international conference on computer design september 16 18 2002 freiburg germany abstract the imagine stream processor is a single chip programmable media processor with 48 parallel alus at 400mhz this translates to a peak arithmetic rate of 16gflops on single precision data and 32gops on 16 bit fixed point data the scalability of imagine's programming model and architecture enable it to achieve such high arithmetic rates imagine executes applications that have been mapped to the stream programming model the stream model decomposes applications into a set of computation kernels that operate on data streams this mapping exposes the inherent locality and parallelism in the application and imagine exploits the locality and parallelism to provide a scalable architecture that supports 48 alus on a single chip this paper presents the imagine architecture and programming model in the first half and explores the scalability of the imagine architecture in the second half paper adobe pdf format bibtex entry inproceedings kapasi 2002 tis author ujval kapasi and william j dally and scott rixner and john d owens and brucek khailany title the i magine stream processor booktitle proceedings 2002 ieee international conference on computer design pages 282 288 year 2002 optaddress freiburg germany month sep ujval kapasi
