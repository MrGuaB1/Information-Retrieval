same origin policy protecting browser state from web privacy attacks same origin policy protecting browser state from web privacy attacks stanford university computer science department abstract demos countermeasures publications staff abstract through a variety of means including a range of browser cache methods and inspecting the color of a visited hyperlink client side browser state can be exploited to track users against their wishes this tracking is possible because persistent client side browser state is not properly partitioned on per site basis in current browsers we address this problem by refining the general notion of a same origin policy and by designing and implementing two browser extensions that apply a same origin policy to the browser cache and visited links we also analyze various degrees of cooperation between sites to track users and show that even if long term browser state is properly partitioned it is still possible for sites to use modern web features to bounce users between sites and invisibly engage in cross domain tracking of their visitors cooperative privacy attacks are an unavoidable consequence of all persistent browser state that affects the behavior of the browser and disabling or frequently expiring this state is the only way to achieve true privacy against colluding parties demos here are some proof of concept sites to demonstrate cache and visited link based tracking techniques they can be used to determine whether safecache and safehistory are working css visited link tracking demo by harrison ting browser recon by markus jakobsson tom n jagatic and sid stamm stealing search engine queries with javascript spi dynamics safecache test cases safehistory test cases countermeasures these firefox browser extensions enforce a same origin policy on cache and visited links install safecache 1.0 for mozilla firefox 2 or firefox 1.5 source code 19kb more info install safehistory 0.9 for mozilla firefox 2 or firefox 1.5 source code 19kb more info questions comments send us feedback publications collin jackson andrew bortz dan boneh and john c mitchell protecting browser state from web privacy attacks pdf proceedings of the 15th acm world wide web conference www 2006 powerpoint presentation from www 2006 more anti phishing projects at stanford staff collin jackson andrew bortz dan boneh john mitchell stanford security lab
