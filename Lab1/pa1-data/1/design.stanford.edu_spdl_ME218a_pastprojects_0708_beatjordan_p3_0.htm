home home back 4 2 3 1 mpeg is consists of 4 major modules 1 goal module 2 swag module 3 shooting module and 4 buzzer potentiometer and leds additionally it has a control panel and a ball extracting part home back top coin sensor circuit uses an op amp and a comparator a trans resistive circuit is used to generate the current when ir signal is received the output of the trans resistive circuit is connected to lm324 in order to amplify the signal the output of the amplifier is connected to a schmitt trigger implemented with lm339 in order to create a clean noise free digital signal the output of the schmitt trigger is tied to the input of the pin ad3 of a 9s12c32 to interface backup calculations v+ of lm324 was connected to the potentiometer the voltage of the potentiometer was 3v the following schmitt trigger r pullup 3.3 k u r4 10 k u r5 100 k u r6 2.2 k u and r7 3.3 k u where is used since the amplifier and the schmitt trigger are inverting ones the output of the circuit is low when there is a goal and high otherwise home back top
