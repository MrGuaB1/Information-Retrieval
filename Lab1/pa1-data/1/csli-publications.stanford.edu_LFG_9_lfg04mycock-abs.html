mycock lfg04 abstract the wh expletive construction louise mycock abstract proceedings of lfg04 csli publications on line this paper is the first to provide an analysis of the wh expletive scope marking or partial movement construction in the non derivational framework of lexical functional grammar this construction is an interrogative in which a wh phrase takes matrix scope even though it appears in an embedded question the scope of the true wh phrase in the embedded clause must be marked by the presence of a wh word in the matrix clause after exploring the generalisations which can be made about this construction data are presented which show that the wh word in the matrix clause is an expletive associated with an embedded interrogative clause i argue that the relationship between the two is an example of functional control in which the f structure of an interrogative comp is shared with a wh expletive which bears the discourse function focus this analysis accounts for the set of properties which define the wh expletive construction cross linguistically in addition it ensures that the f structures of wh fronting and wh expletive constructions with equivalent meaning are different and therefore the two cannot be compared in terms of economy
