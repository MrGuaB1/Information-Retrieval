continued fractions converting to decimal my notes continued fractions definition basic results convergence periodic continued fractions the pell equation matrices hyperbolic trigonometric functions computing with continued fractions continued fraction output bihomographic functions nonsimple continued fractions converting to decimal algebraic numbers cheat sheet some thoughts the hakmem constant converting to decimal suppose we want to output a decimal representation of  a 1 a 2 then we start computing convergents via a table with one change when the last two convergents have the same integer part n we output and subtract n then multiply the numerator by 10 we demonstrate this on  using the space saving notation 3 7 15 1 292 0 1 1 0 3 1 22 7 the last two convergents both floor to 3 so we output 3 subtract it from both convergents to get 0 1 1 7 and multiply by 10 output 3 3 7 15 1 292 0 1 1 0 0 1 10 7 we ve deleted the old values for clarity but in future we shall preserve them continuing for a few more steps output 3.141 3 7 15 1 292 0 1 1 0 0 1 10 7 30 7 20 7 150 106440 106160 106 180 113 conversion from decimal converting to a nonsimple continued fraction is immediate as seen by the example of   3 1 0 10 1 1 0 10 4 3 1 0 1000 141 1 0 1000 592 my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
