oc005 honors chemistry page 1 oc005 honors chemistry course description honors chemistry is a year long seminar style course that introduces the fundamental language ideas and tools used in the study of chemistry this advanced introductory high school chemistry course covers key topics such as chemical nomenclature stoichiometry the periodic table chemical bonding equilibrium kinetics thermodynamics nuclear chemistry and common laboratory practices emphasis will be placed on the use of chemistry in the natural world physical world and our daily lives honors chemistry will give students the skills necessary to describe chemical processes and behaviors and to solve numerical and verbal problems in chemistry upon completion students will have a solid foundation in chemistry and will be prepared for ap biology ap chemistry and college level chemistry courses goals to communicate chemical information using proper terms of measurement units and significant figures to communicate and understand the language of chemistry using atomic symbols to recognize and describe the states of matter the transition between these states and the differences between atoms molecules compounds and mixtures to recognize and describe the types of reactions and their stoichiometry to describe and explain the organization of the periodic table the structure periodic trends physical and chemical properties of the elements to apply concepts of molecular structure and bonding to draw and predict the structure and behavior of simple molecules to apply the relationships described by the rules and laws of thermochemistry equilibria kinetics electrochemistry and nuclear chemistry to predict chemical reactivity and describe reactions verbally and mathematically to understand the use of common chemistry laboratory equipment techniques and procedures to apply and recognize the proper application of the scientific method in investigations of the physical world to observe and perform laboratory experiments collect and or analyze experimental data graphically and make conclusions about the chemical properties or reactions based on these observations to gain an enduring appreciation for the chemistry that surrounds you each day as a citizen consumer and student required textbook introductory chemistry 3rd edition by nivaldo j tro isbn 10 0 13 600382 6 isbn 13 978 0 13 600382 3 page 2 2 key assignments each semester the final letter grade will be determined through the following types of assignments class participation this portion of the grade will be determined based on attendance and regular participation in the discussion including asking and answering questions each semester there are 1 2 in class group presentations focusing on a current topic that also count toward the participation score homework weekly problem sets are taken from the textbook quizzes weekly quizzes that are either written problems or multiple choice questions to test learning objectives from each unit lab reports laboratory worksheets or notebook entries will be required for all at home lab work these build the skills necessary to write a formal lab report in later courses midterm and final exams there will be a comprehensive written proctored midterm and final exam that will include multiple choice questions regarding material covered in lecture discussions and lab work and free response questions that will probe knowledge of problem solving skills knowledge of laboratory work conceptual knowledge and chemical nomenclature
