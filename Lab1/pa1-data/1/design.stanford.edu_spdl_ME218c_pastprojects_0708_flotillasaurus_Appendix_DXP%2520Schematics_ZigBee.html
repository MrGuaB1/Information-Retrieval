zigbee zigbee this is the standard zigbee board me218c gave to us instead of using the pic16f690 it was designed for we plugged in our own dspic instead this wasn t an issue since we only used the serial receive and transmit lines we also had to step up down the voltages since the zigbee operates on 3.3 v and our dspic operated on 5v
