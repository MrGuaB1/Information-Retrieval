vicky wong vicky wong email i just graduated from stanford with a ph d in computer science my adviser was mark horowitz whose research group work on a wide variety of projects i first started working on the architecture design of smart memories a reconfigurable chip multi processor that supports different parallel execution models my focus was on the multi threading support in hardware along the way i worked on a few simulators a transaction programming model and various parallel applications eventually that led to my dissertation work on characterizing a set of probabilistic inference algorithms based on bayesian and markov networks in the contexts of their scalability on chip multi processors and their resilience against transient faults in the circuit research interests computer architecture particularly chip multi processor design parallel programming model and environment parallel application performance optimization things i enjoy hiking backpacking rock climbing skiing scuba diving books that i cannot put down until i have finished anime natural hotsprings updated on 10 26 07 by vicky wong
