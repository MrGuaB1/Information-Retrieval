solar powered refrigeration for rural tanzanian communities what is solar thermal absorption refrigeration we will be creating page 1 solar powered refrigeration for rural tanzanian communities what is solar thermal absorption refrigeration we will be creating a refrigerator capable of making large amounts of ice without electricity absorption refrigerators use heat instead of electricity to pump heat from a cooling cabinet to the outside lowering the temperature of the cabinet's contents the process starts at the solar collector which uses radiation from the sun to heat the working fluid ammonia as a result it becomes a hot high pressure gas the ammonia is then transferred to the condenser which lowers the temperature of the fluid at a constant pressure turning it into a liquid from there it is fed into the cooling tank and the pressure is reduced the drop in pressure causes the ammonia to evaporate and retrace its route back to the solar collector this evaporation process takes heat with it thus cooling the contents cabinet and making ice motivation refrigeration technology reduces post harvest losses reduces food waste and lowers the risk of food born illnesses many communities in tanzania lack access to the electricity grid as a result residents cannot take advantage of technologies essential for economic growth including refrigeration a solar powered refrigeration unit will enable the generation of ice without electricity dissigno and the class will provide the technology to enable entrepreneurs to set up businesses selling ice in these communities such technology will not only enable these entrepreneurs to make a living but also spur the growth of other businesses that take advantage of this new commodity and improve the lives of families that struggle to gather enough food to eat
