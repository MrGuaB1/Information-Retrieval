ip multicast channels express support for large scale single source applications hugh w holbrook and david r cheriton department of computer science stanford university holbrook dsg stanford edu cheriton dsg stanford edu abstract in the ip multicast model a set of hosts can be aggregated into a group of hosts with one address to which any host can send however internet tv distance learning file distribution and other emerging large scale multicast applications strain the current realization of this model which lacks a basis for charging lacks access control and is difficult to scale this paper proposes an extension to ip multicast to support the channel model of multicast and describes a specific realization called explicitly requested single source express multicast in this model a multicast channel has exactly one explicitly designated source and zero or more channel subscribers a single protocol supports both channel subscription and efficient collection of channel information such as subscriber count we argue that express addresses the aforementioned problems justifying this multicast service model in the internet to appear in the proceedings of acm sigcomm 99 cambridge massachusetts september 1999 preprints of this paper are available postscript 562k gzipped postscript 127k bzipped postscript 106k
