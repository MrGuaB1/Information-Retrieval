project description page 1 overall project goals the global ecology research center at stanford university is an extremely low energy laboratory and office building for the carnegie institution of washington the mission of the new department of global ecology is to conduct basic research on the interactions between the earth's ecosystems land atmosphere and oceans from the research er's perspective the most pressing environmental issue is global climate change rather than fol low the more diffuse focus of leed the client encouraged the design team to drastically reduce carbon impacts while providing laboratory and research spaces that meet the highest standards of comfort and performance this unique focus al lowed the design team to reduce carbon emissions associated with the building operation and ma terials by over 60 while aggressively pursuing habitat and water conservation goals a january 2005 post occupancy study for the center for the built environment at berke ley cbe documents high occupant satisfaction across a wide range of categories as compared to the 158 building cbe database see diagram on a scale of 3 to 3 overall building satisfac tion scored at 2.39 vs 91 average thermal comfort at 1.43 vs 0.20 average and air quality at 2.61 vs 22 average occupants are responding to unusually high levels of thermal visual and acoustic comfort which are integral to the energy strategies proper orientation great daylighting sunshading and natural ventilation set the stage for innovative mechanical systems which add more to the project than low energy cooling the night sky radiant system demon strates the same principles of radiant heat loss to deep space that researchers are investigating while a cool tower serves as an iconic focal point that draws visitors to the center and anchors the indoor outdoor lobby size 10890 sf research building 14420 sf including storage workshop program the building program describes five primary functions laboratory office storage workshop and greenhouse approximately 45 full time researchers and staff occupy the buildings year round conducting research in the labs preparing computer simulations or in support of fieldwork the department hosts occasional lectures confer ences and distinguished international visitors and collaborates with researchers working in other departments at stanford construction cost the research building cost $4050673 or $372 sf building occupancy and type b occupancy office research s 2 storage workshop type v non rated completion spring 2004 project description
