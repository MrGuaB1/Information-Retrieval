policy voting what amici tell us about law policy voting what amici tell us about law alexandra dunworth daniel e ho & joshua fischman abstract we compile a new database of individual merits positions by over 600 of the most active amicus groups in over 14000 briefs in supreme court cases from 1978 2006 matched to individual votes by each justice this rich data seamlessly addresses a host of previously difficult to answer questions about interest group litigation in the court we illustrate how amici shed insight into long standing debates about law policy and judicial decisionmaking since interest groups are primarily policy motivated they provide one crucial comparison group to substantively understand attitudinalism and jurisprudential considerations on the court our findings are twofold first if one is willing to assume a unidimensional policy space as most conventional approaches do then the vast majority of groups is entirely to the left or to the right of the court this stems from the fact that interest groups on average disagree with a unanimous court in nearly one out of six cases second we show that unidimensionality is violated across a host of issue areas where interest group considerations deviate sharply from those of the court our evidence demonstrates that the court operates in a space that is significantly more confined or distinct than that of interest groups download manuscript
