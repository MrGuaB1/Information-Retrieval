plinko electronics coin sensor home electronics top coin sensor home overview electronics software mechanics downloads wisdom electronics top coin sensor a h21a2 slot detector was used to detect when a coin was inserted into the plinko mpag the output from the detector was then input into an inverting comparator lm339 with a reference voltage of 2.5 v and a hysteresis band of 0.05 v to generate a quickly changing digital output when no coin is present between the emitter and detector the output of the circuit is low as soon as the pathway is blocked by a coin the circuit outputs a high signal the forward voltage of the emitter is rated 1.7 v at 60ma by choosing a 120  resistor we assured that a current of 27.5 ma through the led which is more than sufficient to saturate the detector when no coin is present the detector generates a current of roughly 1.4 ma in this state the output to the comparator is 4.6 v well above the 2.505 v needed to switch the comparator's output from high to low when a coin blocks the ir emitter the only current from the detector is leakage current in the worst case scenario the leakage current is 100na and the output to the comparator is 0.3 mv safely below the 2.495 v necessary to swithch the compartor output from low to high the lm339 comparator has a turn on time of 8s and a turn off time of 50s these switch times are more than fast enough to detect a coin passing through the slot detector
