luis and otoguro lfg05 abstract morphological and syntactic well formedness the case of european portuguese proclitics ana r luis and ryo otoguro abstract proceedings of lfg05 csli publications on line european portuguese proclitics illustrate a mismatch between inflectional status and syntactic separability which is challenging to lexicalist theories of syntax on the one hand they form morphologically complex clitic clusters and realise verbal properties on the other they may be separated from the verb by lexical items showing no sign of being morphologically attached to it the question then is how to account for the partly inflectional and partly phrasal behaviour of proclitic affixes in a theory of syntax that prohibits elements smaller than words from being syntactically visible in defence of the principle of lexical integrity bresnan 2001 92 luis & sadler 2003 take the view that proclitic affixes may not be assigned a c structure position in this paper we also endorse the view that morphology and phrase structure constitute separate levels of analysis but explore an alternative analysis
