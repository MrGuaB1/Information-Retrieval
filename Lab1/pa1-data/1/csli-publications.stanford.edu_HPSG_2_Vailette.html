irish gaps and resumptive pronouns in hpsg irish gaps and resumptive pronouns in hpsg nathan vaillette ohio state university unbounded dependency constructions in irish such as relative clauses can be made with both gaps as in 1 and resumptive pronouns as in 2 examples from mccloskey 1979 1 an fear a duirt me a shil me a beadh ann the man al said i al thought i al would be there the man that i said that i thought would be there 2 an t ursceal ar mheas me gur thuig me e the novel an thought i go understood i it the novel that i thought i understood this paper will sketch an hpsg treatment of such constructions and their interactions with the distribution of the sentence initial particles go al and an we focus particularly on relative clauses and constituent questions but believe that the same analysis can be extended to other gap and resumptive constructions we analyze resumptives with a nonlocal feature resump which is propagated like the slash feature used for gaps this is supported by the existence of a particle pattern that marks intermediate clauses in resumptive dependencies we also discuss some exceptional particle patterns associated with bare np adverbials and shown how they can be incorporated into the analysis though certain unresolved problems remain references mccloskey j 1979 transformational syntax and model theoretic semantics a case study in modern irish dordrecht reidel
