spacecraft demonstrates einstein theory page 1 close by frank morring jr nasa's $700 million gravity probe b gp b experiment has demonstrated two key aspects of albert einstein's general theory of relativity but not to the hoped for degree of confidence because of the complexity of making the extremely subtle measurements in space the project generated valuable technology and scientific spin offs including 100 new ph d scientists whose graduate work contributed to gpb it also taught some important lessons on the risks associated with tackling such an ambitious project after five years of data processing to eliminate unexpected system noise that obscured the spacetime frame dragging effect predicted from einstein's theory researchers were able to claim only a 20 margin of error in declaring success they had hoped for 1 or better which they achieved with a second measurement of what is known as the geodetic effect using einstein's theory the experiment's designers calculated that the rotors would drift off the guide star by 6606.1 milliarcseconds over a year because of the geodetic effect basically the effect of earth's gravity on spacetime for frame dragging which has been compared to spinning a bowling ball in a pool of molasses the predicted value was 39.2 milliarcseconds the final results as presented by gp b principal investigator francis everitt of stanford university at nasa headquarters may 4 were a geodetic drift of 6601.8 milliarcseconds 18.3 and a frame dragging drift of 37.2 milliarcseconds 7.2 the team published its findings in the journal physical review letters the frame dragging we ve measured to a little better than 20 so that's the results of the experiment everitt says achieving the precision necessary for such fine measurement required development of 13 new spacecraft technologies and produced a unique spacecraft that merged its instrument guidance and control functions into a single system basically gpb was a 3.4 ton satellite built to keep four almost perfect spheres of fused quartz and silicon about the size of pingpong balls spinning at 5000 rpm without interference unfortunately there was an unanticipated electric polarity in the rotors niobium layer that manifested as surface magnetic fields when they were spun up ground testing had not detected it and it proved extremely complicated to process out underscoring the risks of trying to build such a complex spacecraft but some of the gpb technology has found its way into other spacecraft including a porous plug used to manage the liquid helium that cooled the gyros to 1.8 k that technology in turn enabled nasa's cosmic background explorer which won john mather and george smoot the 2006 nobel prize in physics for work with that spacecraft confirming the big bang theory when people started thinking about how to measure the cosmic background i don t think they were thinking very hard about how to manage a superfluid helium dewar said teledyne brown engineering president rex geveden who was the gp b project manager at the marshall space flight center there's a case where the technology came about and found an application in a very important other scientific experiment so i think there's a sense in which in the field of technology dreams people find a way to use what you produce photo nasa copyright 2011 aviation week a division of the mcgraw hill companies all rights reserved terms of use privacy policy spacecraft demonstrates einstein theory http www aviationweek com aw jsp_includes articleprint jsp headline spacecraft 1 of 1 5 9 11 1 40 pm
