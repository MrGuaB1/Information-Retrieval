newsletter dge newsletter july 2005 new faculty member yingping wang visitor july 1 ken caldeira began moving into the department today he comes to us from the climate & carbon cycle modeling group at the lawrence livermore nat l laboratory and is a physicist with specialties in atmospheric science and oceanography also today he made the front page of the ny times under the headline british scientists say carbon dioxide is turning the oceans acidic although ken is not british he served on a panel commissioned by the royal society to study global warming the following is an excerpt from the article dr ken caldeira a research scientist at the carnegie institution's department of global ecology in stanford calif said the difference was that the current carbon dioxide release was occurring quickly over just two centuries in the past water from the deeper ocean would have had time to mix diluting the effect of the carbon dioxide if we put it out over a few hundred thousand years we d have nothing to worry about he said here is a snapshot of ken taken when he gave us a seminar on nov 24 2003 we are pleased to welcome yingping back for another six month's visit from the csiro marine & atmospheric research group in melbourne australia he ll be modeling carbon and nitrogen interactions in terrestrial systems with ties to all of our faculty groups the aim will be to evaluate all assumptions whether specific to one system or global then to see whether various models can be combined to gain even more information asner lab please welcome maoyi huang to the lab and the department maoyi joins us after finishing her ph d in civil engineering at berkeley just a month ago her dissertation work involved hydrological and land surface modeling at the landscape to regional scale at carnegie maoyi will be working in the context of carbon cycle analysis of land use climate interactions and with coupled carbon climate satellite modeling approaches one of the first focus areas for maoyi is amazonia she will be looking at land use climate interactions from the modeling and remote sensing perspectives as you all know this is a great time to be doing this kind of modeling work since we have so many new data products coming from the lba program and so many unanswered questions about that region of the world maoyi links our lab to inez fung's group at berkeley and to dave randall at csu on a shared research grant from nasa and with the field berry and caldeira labs at many different levels news from the outer world dear colleagues as of july 30th my old elsac stanford edu email will no longer exist my new email is cleland nceas ucsb edu i ll be starting a new post doctoral position at nceas on august 1st i ve greatly enjoyed spending the last two months with my new son max but i m also looking forward to getting back to work i hope all is well with you elsa cleland editor jan brown e mail jbrown globalecology stanford edu click on photos for enlargement chris field shares a part of one of five proposals that will receive an average grant of $128000 from 2005 to 2007 from the stanford institute for the environment this proposal is to study the reintroduction of the bay checkerspot butterfly to stanford university lands archives and pdf archives of past newsletters
