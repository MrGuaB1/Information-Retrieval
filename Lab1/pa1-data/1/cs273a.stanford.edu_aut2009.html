cs273a a computational tour of the human genome course description genomes are the ultimate biological information medium carrying the key instructions for every organism's development life cycle and reproduction in this course we will study genomes from a bioinformatics perspective we will cover advances in our understanding of biology that have resulted from recent sequencing of the human and dozens of related organisms topics will include 1 genome sequencing technologies assembly personalized sequencing 2 functional landscape genes regulatory modules repeats rna genes epigenetics 3 genome evolution evolutionary processes comparative genomics ultraconservation exaptation as time permits we may cover population genetics and personalized genomics ancient dna metagenomics or other current topics introductory bio and cs sessions date subject 9 25 introductory biology primer 10 2 introduction to text processing 10 9 ucsc genome browser tools schedule date title hw related material 1 9 21 introduction gill 2 9 23 the human genome human variation somatic mutations and cancer gill 3 9 28 genome content repetitive sequences and genes gill 4 9 30 dna sequencing serafim hw1 out modelling the recent common ancestry of all living humans 5 10 5 sequence assembly serafim 6 10 7 genome evolution chromosomal mutations paralogy & orthology chains & nets gill 7 10 12 genome reconstruction chains & nets conservation & function gill 8 10 14 sequencing technologies serafim hw2 out 9 10 19 multiple sequence alignment serafim 10 10 21 multiple sequence alignment continued serafim 11 10 26 non coding rnas gill halfway feedback 12 10 28 cis regulation and cellular signalling gill 13 11 2 conservation serafim project out 14 11 4 nadav ahituv ucsf 15 11 9 human population genetics serafim 16 11 11 terry capellini stanford 17 11 16 ultraconservation gill project milestone 18 11 18 nate dominy ucsc 19 11 30 gill subs 20 12 2 project presentations
