emf 22 greenhouse gas stabilization page 1 emf 22 greenhouse gas stabilization motivation although uncertainty surrounds the politics of climate change policy there are emerging important technological developments that could fundamentally alter mitigation strategies carbon sequestration options could capture and store carbon both in underground oil and gas extraction and in generating power from fossil fuels the bush administration has focused corporate and government attention on the prospects of a hydrogen economy at some point in the future scientific research has focused attention on the role of non carbon greenhouse gases for all of these reasons previous estimates of the costs of stabilizing future greenhouse gas concentrations may now be seriously outdated focus a new study on greenhouse gas stabilization will allow an integrated and systematic analysis of the problem and various strategies by incorporating the most recent information available in modeling frameworks as a result of recent emf studies and other efforts the community of integrated assessment modelers has increased its knowledge about a number of factors that affect costs issues technology plays a critical role in stabilization plans what roles will hydrogen carbon sequestration options and other greenhouse gases play in the estimation of costs associated with reaching various greenhouse stabilization targets how will these technologies alter the energy mix in various regions of the world both with and without stabilization in what significant ways can existing models incorporate more technological detail of interest to the policymaker or corporate strategist how can technology experts help improve the frameworks for evaluating stabilization and its effect what constraints do agricultural forestry and other land use place on stabilization strategies what are reasonable population growth trends and how does advanced productivity and income affect demography what other criteria need to be incorporated into stabilization and other scenarios that would be useful to a wider community of interested parties what is the evidence for convergence between rich and poor countries and how does this trend influence economic growth especially in the developed countries page 2 economy technology & integrated assessment models 19 asia australia abare guy jakeman & brian fisher with gtem cicero university of oslo ha aaheim with combat energy research institute china jiang kejun with ipac iae japan atsushi kurosawa with grape national institute for environmental studies japan junichi fujino with aim indian institute of management p shukla with sgm india canada mcgill university richard loulou with etsap tiam europe cea idei marc vielle with gemini e3 cntr for european econ research c boehringer & a loschel with eu pace copenhagen economics jesper jensen with the edge model hamburg univ richard tol with fund iiasa shilpa rao with message oldenburg university germany claudia kemfert with wiagem rivm detlef van vuuren tom kram & bas eickhout with image upmf patrick criqui & cirad daniel deybe with poles agripol united states argonne nat lab don hanson & epa skip laitner with amiga epri rich richels & stanford univ alan manne with merge mit john reilly with eppa pnnl jgcri jae edmonds hugh pitcher & steve smith with sgm & minicam scientific and technical experts non co2 ghg experts dina kruger and francisco de la chesnaye usepa paul freund and john gale iea greenhouse gas r&d programme methane & n20 ann gardiner judith bates aea technology casey delhotal dina kruger elizabeth scheehle usepa chris hendriks niklas hoehne ecofys fluorinated hgwp gases jochen harnish ecofls germany deborah ottinger and dave godwin usepa sinks terrestrial sequestration bruce mccarl texas a&m ken andrasko usepa & jayant sathaye lbnl roger sedjo rff & brent sohngen ohio state university ron sands pnnl jgcri page 3 adaptation gary yohe wesleyan university sally kane national science foundation hydrogen sequestration and other technologies franklyn orr stanford university other experts from stanford's global change and energy project g cep and its collaborators howard herzog mit dale simbeck sfa pacific
