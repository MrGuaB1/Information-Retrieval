cs229a faq cs 229a applied machine learning frequently asked questions general questions q what are the prerequisites for the course a students are expected to have at least basic programming skills at the level of cs106b or cs106x in addition students are expected to be familiar with basic linear algebra specifically you should know about matrix vector addition and multiplication matrix transpose matrix inverse math 51 is more than enough note that this is a lesser set of prerequisites compared to cs229 q how does cs229a relate to cs229 which should i take a cs229a is complementary to cs229 and provides more applied skills it's okay to take both though enrollment in cs229a is limited and we may give priority to students who have not taken and who are not taking cs229 if your goal is a deep mathematical understanding of machine learning or if your goal is to do research in ai or machine learning you should definitely take cs229 either instead of or in addition to cs229a cs229 has a more difficult set of prerequisites if you are interested in machine learning but aren t sure if you re ready for the mathematical depth that cs229 requires then consider taking cs229a instead q what is the difference between 3 and 4 units a the class can be taken for 3 or 4 units there is no difference in workload between them we recommend you sign up for 4 units unless you d previously taken cs229 for 4 units specifically because there is a small amount of overlap between the two classes you can take cs229 and cs229a only for a maximum of 7 units total so if you d previously taken cs229 for 4 units please sign up only for 3 units of cs229a if you re taking cs229 and cs229a at the same time we recommend you sign up for 4 units in cs229 and 3 units in cs229a q if i take cs229 and cs229a at the same time can the same project be used for both classes a yes you can do one joint project for both classes but we will expect the project to be significantly more substantial q how is cs229a related to the public online machine learning class ml class org a cs229a is stanford's offering of this class for stanford students note also that the public online class starts two weeks later than the stanford class
