robots performing day to day tasks robots performing day to day tasks in our stair project we want to build a robot capable of performing a variety of day to day tasks in home and office environments in the long term we want it to fetch and deliver items show guests around the lab and clean up after a party for starters we teach it to navigate hallways and open doors videos note these videos have been sped up for better viewing fully autonomous experiments including navigation and manipulation in these experiments the robot relies on a single laser sensor visiting a conference room stopping by printer room entering an office from our earlier work opening doors using contact sensing 2005 11 01 in this video the robot locates the door handle by touching it it does not use any other sensors only door handle probing and manipulation are autonomous motion of the mobile platform is controlled with a joystick relevant publications probabilistic mobile manipulation in dynamic environments with application to opening doors anna petrovskaya and andrew y ng international joint conference on artificial intelligence ijcai hyderabad india 2007 pdf bayesian estimation for autonomous object manipulation based on tactile sensors anna petrovskaya oussama khatib sebastian thrun and andrew y ng ieee international conference on robotics and automation icra orlando florida 2006 pdf also poster version from wiml06 ppt back to my homepage
