depth extraction imagine architecture programming performance vlsi board applications tools depth mpeg rendering depth extraction in stereo depth extraction two cameras are located a fixed horizontal distance apart on the same vertical and depth axes a computer is employed to determine the distance of objects from the plane of the cameras this task consumes substantial computing resources as each pixel of the final depth image requires two convolution operations imagine sustains 12.1 gops for stereo depth extraction which allows extraction of 212 frames per second of 320x240 8 bit grayscale images figure 1 shows the source images from a pair of simulated cameras figure 2 is the depth map produced by the depth extraction figure 1 left and right camera images figure 2 resulting depth map depth extraction has applications in the extraction of 3 d models of real objects these models are useful for purposes which require real time 3 d data such as tele presence communications gajh cva stanford edu
