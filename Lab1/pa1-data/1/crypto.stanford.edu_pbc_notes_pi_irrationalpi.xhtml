pi proof that pi is irrational my notes pi proof that pi is irrational the gregory leibniz series the wallis product ramanujan's formula for pi computing pi in c proof that pi is irrational suppose  a b define f x x n a bx n n and f x f x f 2 x f 4 x 1 n f 2 n x for every positive integer n first note that f x and its derivatives f i x have integral values for x 0 and also for x  a b since f x f a b x we have d d x f x sin x f x cos x f x sin x f x sin x f x sin x whence &integral 0  f x sin x dx f x sin x f x cos x 0  f  f 0 &element &zopf but for 0 x  we have 0 f x sin x  n a n n which means we have an integer that is positive but tends to zero as n approaches infinity which is a contradiction my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
