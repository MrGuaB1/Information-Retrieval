ball requester ball requester the ball requester was a scotch yolk mechanism picture to right that was driven by a servo motor the pushing arm and housing for this component were made out of masonite the ball requester was mounted on the underside of the uppermost deck forward facing so that when the robot arrived at the ball dispenser it was ready to request balls the servo motor was driven by 5 volts and given two different pwm values to hold the pusher arm in two positions extended and retracted timers were used to control the pushing time retracting time pause time between ball requests and pause time between sets of 5 balls as specified in the project guidelines ultimately a ramming mechanism picture to left replaced the scotch yolk mechanism due to the change in strategy ball sorter the ball sorter was made out of masonite and featured a swiveling sorter arm that was driven by a servo motor the sorter arm received balls in its neutral position and then pivoted to the drop holes on either its right or left side to store or shoot balls appropriately a switch was mounted in the masonite platform directly under the sorter arm's neutral position the purpose of this switch was to indicate when a ball was resting inside of the sorter arm additionally a tape sensor was mounted on the sorter arm for use as a ball color detector the servo motor was driven by 5 volts and given three pwm values to hold the sorter arm in three positions neutral shooting and dumping timers were used to control how long the sorter arm would rest over the drop holes to avoid any jamming ball shooter the ball shooter was a flywheel style launcher driven by a dc motor controlled using a pwm signal a curved tube fed the balls to the wheel and featured a slit at the bottom for the wheel to fit inside of fender washers were included for added inertia the ball shooter was mounted using masonite braces to minimize vibration and increase stability back to main page back to robot overview
