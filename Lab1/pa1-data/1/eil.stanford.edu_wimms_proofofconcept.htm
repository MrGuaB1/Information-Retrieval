welcome to wireless modular monitoring systems eil engineering informatics group stanford university overview proof of concept system validation tests publications presentations people proof of concept system the prototype shm system we developed incorporates an integrated hardware and software design to implement a simple star topology wireless sensor network a wireless shm system with a star topology includes multiple wireless sensing units assembled in a network with one central server coordinating the activities of the network the wireless sensing units are responsible for acquiring sensor measurements analyzing data and transferring data to the central server for permanent storage or further data interrogation the design of the wireless sensing unit consists of three functional modules the sensing interface the computational core and the wireless communication channel the sensing interface converts analog sensor signals into a digital format usable by the computational core the digitized sensor data is then transferred to the computational core through a high speed serial peripheral interface spi port besides a low power 8 bit atmel atmega128 microcontroller external static random access memory sram is integrated with the computational core to accommodate local data storage and analysis through a universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter uart interface the computational core communicates with the maxstream 9xcite wireless transceiver which provides a wireless connection between the unit and other wireless devices or between the unit and the central server the 9xcite operates on the unlicensed 900mhz radio frequency spectrum and can achieve communication ranges of 300m in open space and 90m in an indoor environment
