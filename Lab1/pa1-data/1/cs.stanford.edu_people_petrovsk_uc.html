vehicle tracking vehicle tracking for autonomous urban driving the stanford racing team aims to develop vehicles able to drive autonomously in urban environments one of the team's robots junior participated in the urban grand challenge where the robots had to autonomously navigate in a mock urban town and follow the california rules with respect to other robots human driven vehicles and the environment the most challenging conditions were presented at the pre qualification event immediately prior the competition in area a trials this page focuses on the vehicle detection and tracking subsystem of junior for other aspects please see the team's website videos tracking in area a at ugc tracking in alameda port town technical overview of vehicle tracking our scaling series algorithm greatly improves the reliability of vehicle detection in these videos the tracker was forced to drop the target to verify reliability of vehicle detection vehicle detection with scaling series vehicle detection without scaling series overall junior performance junior performing in area a at ugc spectator view junior performing in area c at ugc spectator view other materials slides from icra09 workshop on safe navigation slides poster from rss08 and stanford computer forum poster relevant publications model based vehicle detection and tracking for autonomous urban driving anna petrovskaya and sebastian thrun autonomous robots journal vol 26 2 3 pp 123 139 april 2009 pdf springer model based vehicle tracking in urban environments anna petrovskaya and sebastian thrun icra 2009 workshop on safe navigation pdf slides junior the stanford entry in the urban challenge m montemerlo j becker s bhat h dahlkamp d dolgov s ettinger d haehnel t hilden g hoffmann b huhnke d johnston s klumpp d langer a levandowski j levinson j marcil d orenstein j paefgen i penny a petrovskaya m pflueger g stanek d stavens a vogt and s thrun field and service robot journal 2008 pdf model based vehicle tracking for autonomous driving in urban environments anna petrovskaya and sebastian thrun rss 2008 pdf poster efficient techniques for dynamic vehicle detection anna petrovskaya and sebastian thrun iser 2008 pdf back to my homepage fig 1 junior negotiating an intersection at the urban grand challenge in 2007 fig 2 junior's sensors applanix ins for localization several laser range finders and radars fig 4 working with 3d data left to right and top to bottom actual scene velodyne data classification of points generated virtual scan overlaid on velodyne data fig 3 tracking results at the area a test during the urban challenge pre qualification event top to bottom actual scene tracking overlaid on velodyne data tracking overlaid on virtual scan for more results see the videos
