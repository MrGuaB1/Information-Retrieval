m machine publications the m machine multicomputer abstract the m machine is an experimental multicomputer being developed to test architectural concepts motivated by the constraints of modern semiconductor technology and the demands of programming systems the m machine computing nodes are connected with a 3 d mesh network each node is a multithreaded processor incorporating 12 function units on chip cache and local memory the multiple function units are used to exploit both instruction level and thread level parallelism a user accessible message passing system yields fast communication and synchronization between nodes rapid access to remote memory is provided transparently to the user with a combination of hardware and software mechanisms this paper presents the architecture of the m machine and describes how its mechanisms attempt to maximize both single thread performance and overall system throughput the architecture is complete and the multi alu processor chip which will serve as the m machine processing node is currently being implemented
