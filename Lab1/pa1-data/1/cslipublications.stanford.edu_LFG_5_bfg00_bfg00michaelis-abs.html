abstract aspectual meaning as construction meaning laura a michaelis coercion effects including aspectual ones appear to indicate a modular grammatical architecture in which the process of composition may add meanings absent in the syntax in order to ensure that certain functors eg the progressive operator receive suitable arguments herweg 1991 jackendoff 1997 de swart 1998 in this paper coercion effects are instead taken as evidence for the existence of symbolic rules of morphosyntactic combination which can in cases of semantic conflict shift the designations of lexical items with which they combine on this account enriched composition is a by product of the ordinary referring behavior of constructions thus for example the constraint which requires semantic concord between the syntactic sisters in the string a bottle is also what underlies the coerced interpretation found in a beer if this concord constraint is stated for a rule of morphosyntactic combination we capture an important generalization one combinatory mechanism underlies both coercion and instantiation since both type selecting constructions eg the french imperfective and type shifting constructions eg the english progressive require semantic concord between sisters we account for the fact that constructions of both types perform coercion differences in the functional ranges of tense constructions in english and french are attributed to differences in coercion potential rather than differences in constructional semantics per se coercion effects are taken as evidence that aspectual sensitivity defines not only the french past tense as described by de swart 1998 but also tenses in general including the english past and present tenses
