coverbs and complex predicates in wagiman csli publications logo new_books backlist series contact authors order search lpl coverbs and complex predicates in wagiman stephen wilson wagiman is an australian aboriginal language spoken in the top end of the northern territory it possesses an unusual open class of words which the author calls coverbs most frequently coverbs are paired with an inflecting verb from a closed class to form a complex predicate the coverb and inflecting verb jointly determine the verbal semantics and argument structure of the clause this book provides a descriptive and analytical account of the behaviour of coverbs in wagiman especially their role in complex predicate formation wilson aims to discover what principles are at work in directing and constraining this process and how the meaning of the whole is derived from the meanings of the parts after discussing a wide range of relevant data from the language he outlines a formal analysis within lexical functional grammar he argues that to account for the intricacy of wagiman complex predicates it is necessary for the grammar to make explicit reference to representations of lexical meaning and he proposes that complex predicate formation can be seen as the fusion of these semantic representations 3 1 99 isbn paperback 1575861720 isbn cloth 1575861739 subject linguistics wageman wagiman language verb phrase wageman wagiman language adjectives add to cart view cart check out distributed by the university of chicago press series stanford monographs in linguistics pubs csli stanford edu
