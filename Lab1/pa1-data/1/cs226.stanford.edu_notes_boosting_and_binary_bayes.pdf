boosting log odds and binary bayes filters 1 binary bayes filters in the binary bayes filter we wish to estimate the log odd page 1 boosting log odds and binary bayes filters alex teichman 1 binary bayes filters in the binary bayes filter we wish to estimate the log odds lt of a binary variable y 1 1 given a series of measurements z1 t the variable y might indicate grid cell occupancy or whether a tracked cluster in velodyne laser data is a pedestrian for example the update rule see page 94 is lt lt 1 log p y zt p y zt log p y p y 1 2 boosting as a log odds estimator the boosting optimization problem is minh z ep x y exp yh z that is we are looking for a function that minimizes exponential loss writing out the expectation explicitly and assuming z is discrete though this also works for real valued z we have ep z y exp yh z z y p z y exp yh z 2 z p z y p y z exp yh z z p z ep y z exp yh z 3 this may not seem useful until we examine the conditional expectation it is convex in h z so we know when the derivative with respect to h z is zero we are at the minimum ep y z exp yh z p y 1 z exp h z p y 1 z exp h z h z ep y z exp yh z p y 1 z exp h z p y 1 z exp h z setting the derivative to zero we have p y 1 z exp h z p y 1 z exp h z exp 2h z p y 1 z p y 1 z h z 1 2 log p y 1 z p y 1 z this shows that the conditional expectation is minimized when the boosting strong classifier h z returns the log odds up to a constant factor of a half looking back at 3 the joint expectation 2 is minimized if the conditional expectation for every possible z is minimized as we just showed this happens when h z returns the log odds it follows that the joint expectation is minimized when h z returns the log odds now we can make the connection to binary bayes filters 2h z can be used for the second term of 1 and we can use the binary bayes math for integrating our boosting predictions over time date february 24 2010 1
