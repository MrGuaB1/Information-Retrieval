elliptic curves hyperelliptic curves my notes elliptic curves overview the weierstrass form group of points explicit addition formulae field of rational functions zeroes and poles rational maps torsion points the weil pairing the weil pairing ii counting points hyperelliptic curves computing the tate pairing the mov attack points of trace zero hyperelliptic curves elliptic curves can be generalized as follows a hyperelliptic curve c of genus g g 1 has the form c y 2 h x y f x where h is a polynomial with deg h g and f is a monic polynomial with deg f 2 g 1 elliptic curves satisfy this definition for g 1 as for elliptic curves each hyperelliptic curve contains a single point at infinity which we denote o for a point p x y on a hyperelliptic curve let p be the point x y h x so for elliptic curves p p if p p then call p a special point otherwise call it ordinary on elliptic curves special points are points of order 2 however in general there is no group structure on the set of points of a hyperelliptic curve instead we work on the jacobian group which is defined below the jacobian group note that the definitions of function fields and divisors apply to any curve c we define the jacobian group to be div 0 c prin c it turns out that each element of the jacobian group is equivalent to a divisor of the form &sum m i p i &sum m i o where m p 0 implies m p 0 unless p is special in which case m p 1 and &sum m i g for elliptic curves each element of the jacobian is equivalent to p o for some point p and addition on points induces addition in the jacobian my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
