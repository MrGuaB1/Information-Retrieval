continued fractions cheat sheet my notes continued fractions definition basic results convergence periodic continued fractions the pell equation matrices hyperbolic trigonometric functions computing with continued fractions continued fraction output bihomographic functions nonsimple continued fractions converting to decimal algebraic numbers cheat sheet some thoughts the hakmem constant cheat sheet from brute force matrix calculations we can prove coth 1 n n 3 n 5 n tan 1 1 1 1 3 1 5 1 7 1 tan 1 n 0 n 1 1 3 n 2 1 5 n 2 1 7 n 2 1 n 1 invert insert or remove a 0 to derive expansions for tanh and cot we can compute the other trigonometric and hyperbolic trigonometric functions by solving quadratic equations involving continued fractions via the tan x 2 and tanh x 2 identities from the continued fraction of gauss we have arctan z z 1 z 2 3 2 z 2 5 3 z 2 tanh z z 1 z 2 3 z 2 5 z 2 tan z z 1 z 2 3 z 2 5 z 2 the inverse tangent is useful for computing other inverse trigonometric functions its expansion also gives an expansion for  by setting z 1 also  3 1 6 9 6 25 6 but this converges far too slowly for practical purposes euler's continued fraction formula can show log 1 x x 1 1 2 x 2 x 2 2 x 3 2 x e x 1 x 1 x x 2 2 x x 3 3 x x 4 other well known expansions scoured from web searches i wish i knew how these were derived e 2 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 6 1 exp 1 n 1 n 1 1 1 3 n 1 1 1 5 n 1 1 1 n 1 exp 2 m n 1 2 m n m m 2 3 n m 2 5 n m 2 7 n exp z 1 z 1 z 2 z 3 z 2 z 5 z 2 my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
