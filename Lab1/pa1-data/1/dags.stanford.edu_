dags daphne koller's research group home people projects publications misc welcome to dags professor daphne koller's research group our main research focus is on dealing with complex domains that involve large amounts of uncertainty our work builds on the framework of probability theory decision theory and game theory but uses techniques from artificial intelligence and computer science to allow us to apply this framework to complex real world problems most of our work is based on the use of probabilistic graphical models such as bayesian networks influence diagrams and markov decision processes within that topic our work touches on many areas representation inference learning and decision making one main focus has been the extension of the representational power of the probabilistic graphical modeling language to encompass a much richer set of domains more info copyright 2006 dags daphne's approximate group of students all rights reserved
