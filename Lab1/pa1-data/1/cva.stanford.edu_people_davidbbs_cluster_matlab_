submitting matlab jobs to sge clusters here are three simple scripts to submit and run matlab scripts on a cluster via sun's grid engine sge we run this on our rocks cluster but it should work anywhere that sge is used submit_jobs sh run this script from the command line it submits an array job to the sge cluster queue which runs multiple copies of the jobs sh script you need to modify this to change the number of jobs you want ie jobs 1 65 will produce 64 jobs numbered 1 to 64 job sh this script is run on the cluster nodes by the cluster queue it runs matlab with the correct command line arguments to run it silently it tells matlab to run the matlab_job m file you need to modify this to change the path to matlab and the path to your stderr and stdout files matlab_job m this file tries to get the task id sge_task_id of the job if it doesn t find a task id it sets it to 1 if the task id is not 1 this script exits matlab at the end if you don t do this it will never quit you need to modify this file so that it starts the appropriate computation based on the job id all scripts are copyright 2007 by david black schaffer permission to use and or modify them is freely given i am not responsible for any errors or problems associated with them
