cs294a research project in artificial intelligence cs294a cs294w deep learning and unsupervised feature learning winter 2011 announcements the first class will meet on wednesday january 5th 4.15 5.30 pm in gates 120 if you are unable to attend this but would like to take cs294a please i email us at cs294a qa cs stanford edu to let us know and ii print out a hardcopy of the class survey fill it out and drop off the hardcopy in prof ng's mailbox in gates 143 project description in this class we will develop unsupervised deep learning algorithms that are capable of learning useful features for a range of machine learning applications unlike most previous cs294a's this course will pursue work in developing new machine learning algorithms ie core or algorithmic machine learning rather than in applied machine learning because it is challenging to work on algorithmic machine learning we will be able to work with only a small number of students and enrollment will be limited you can find details about enrollment requirements on the handouts and enrollment information page course information course instructor andrew ng ang cs stanford edu class meetings this is a project course there will be no weekly lectures and only two introductory homeworks we will spend the quarter working in teams on different deep learning related projects the whole class will meet on 5th january 4.15 pm 5.30 pm gates 120 and 9th feb 4.15 5.30 pm final project presentations will be held thursday march 17 1 30pm 3 00pm if you were unable to attend the first meeting but would like to take cs294a please email cs294a qa cs stanford edu to let us know more information course information cs294w and wim requirement information handouts and enrollment information
