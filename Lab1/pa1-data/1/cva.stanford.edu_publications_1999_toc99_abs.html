m machine publications concurrent event handling through multithreading abstract exceptions have traditionally been used to handle infrequently occurring and unpredictable events during normal program execution current trends in microprocessor and operating systems design continue to increase the cost of event handling because of the deep pipelines and wide out of order superscalar architectures of contemporary microprocessors an event may need to nullify a large number o in flight instructions large register files require existing software systems to save and restore a substantial amount of process state before executing an exception handler at the same time processors are executing in environments that supply higher event frequencies and demand higher performance we have developed an alternative architecture concurrent event handling that incorporates multithreading into event handling architectures instead of handling the event in the faulting thread's architectural and pipeline registers the fault handler is forked into its own thread slot and executes concurrently with the faulting thread microbenchmark programs show a factor of 3 speedup for concurrent event handling over a traditional architecture on code that takes frequent exceptions we also demonstrate substantial speedups on two event based applications concurrent event handling is implemented in the mit multi alu processor map chip keywords exceptions interrupts multithreading context switching
