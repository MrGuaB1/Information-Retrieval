number fields pythagorean triples my notes number fields sum of two squares ed implies pid implies ufd pythagorean triples fermat's last theorem fermat's last theorem n 4 fermat's last theorem regular primes kummer's lemma number fields gauss lemma cyclotomic fields the trace and the norm trace and norm applications trace and norm generalized the discriminant the additive structure of a number ring quadratic fields the discriminant applications dedekind domains unique factorization of ideals gcds and lcms splitting of primes in extensions ramification indices pythagorean triples we wish to solve x 2 y 2 z 2 over the integers without loss of generality assume x y z have no common factor this implies that z is odd consider the equation modulo 4 first we move to &zopf i x y i x y i z 2 claim x y i u a 2 where u is a unit and a &element &zopf i proof suppose a prime p divides x y i then p divides z thus p 2 must divide both sides if p also divides x y i then it must also divide their sum 2 x but 2 x and z are coprime implying p is a unit which is a contradiction hence we may write x y i u m n i 2 from which we obtain all solutions x y z &pm m 2 n 2 &pm 2 m n &pm m 2 n 2 my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
