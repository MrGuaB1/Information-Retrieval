talklets talkets a new way to teach after giving an online course for five years that was comprised of indexed videos of me lecturing combined with still images of the slides i felt that something better was needed the main problem with the video taped lectures is that they cannot be easily updated also the video quality is not high enough to show the pointer on the slides the solution came to me slowly and even now the final word is still not in the basic idea is to convert a 2 hour lecture into 6 concepts and then present each concept by approximately 10 two minute animations or talklets which show the mouse moving over the animated images as i explain them it is a bit like me sitting behind you and guiding the mouse as i explain a very animated powerpoint slide to you well three months and 550 talklets later i am still unsure about their value i plan to make some talklets that help the novice use word powerpoint excel and acrobat but until then i illustrate the concept with some talklets from my class to see these samples click here feedback to me at michael levitt stanford edu will be very welcome copyright michael levitt updated may 2004
