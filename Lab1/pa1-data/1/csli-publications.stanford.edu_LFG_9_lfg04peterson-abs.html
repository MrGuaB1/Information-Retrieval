peterson lfg04 abstract non restrictive relatives and other non syntagmatic relations in an lf framework peter peterson abstract proceedings of lfg04 csli publications on line non syntagmatic relations involve a loose linking of two or more items in a linear sequence which does not constitute a single grammatical construction the units do not form any larger syntactic unit and are related only by linear adjacency not by hierarchical construction i argue in this paper that non restrictive relative clauses belong to the class of non syntagmatic relations previous attempts to provide a structure based account of non syntagmatic relations have in general been unsatisfactory a solution within the current lfg framework is for the appositional item and its host to retain separate c structures and f structures and i structures if we adopt tracy king's 1997 proposal and to be linked only via cross indexing at a discourse level representation
