ee392c advanced topics in computer architecture ee392c spring 2002 03 advanced topics in computer architecture chip multiprocessors & polymorphic processors professor christos kozyrakis conventional processors are based on the uniprocessor model and can only exploit instruction level parallelism however diminishing returns from scaling superscalar and vliw designs increased design complexity and the ability to pack hundreds of millions of transistors in one chip suggest that future architectures will be single chip multiprocessors cmps this class will cover a class of cmps with coarse grain reconfiguration abilities that allow them to adapt their on chip computing and memory resources to the parallelism data task or instruction level available in each application such processors are known as polymorphic processors the goal is to provide performance and power efficiency similar to application specific designs while maintaining the programmability and flexibility of general purpose processors throughout the quarter we will discuss a series of topics related to the architecture programming model compilation and system software for cmp polymorphic processors the goal is to identify key research issues and through the projects evaluate the potential of promising techniques this course is recommended for electrical engineering and computer science graduate students interested in advanced research in the area of computer systems course information announcements schedule people reading list project resources discussion notes project documents class participation tips references & links christos kozyrakis christos ee stanford edu
