how do fish swim newton s third law how does this law apply to a fish swimming up stream in a river according to newton's third law a muscle contraction will cause a reactive force which will cause a movement of the organism in the opposite direction read more about this here and here except for some of the movement that you can see in unicellular organisms or cells that depends on ciliary or flagell movements all other movements depend on muscular work the muscle movement depends on a complex machinery and the fuel source is atp aadenosine tri phospate all the things that we and the fish eat is ultimately converted to atp that is the fuels source for the entire organism including the muscles a skeletal muscle contraction is also a well coordinated actions that is initiated in the brain that sends signals via nerves to each muscle there are also adjustments of the respiratory and cardiovascular system to make sure that the muscles will get sufficient oxygen and to transport away carbon dioxide and other waste products muscle contractions also generates a lot of heat due to the fact that only 20 25 of the atp used is converted to mechanical energy the rst is converted to heat in fish this is not a problem since the gills are efficient countercurrent exchanges see module on respiration and are equally efficient in exchanging oxygen carbon dioxide as heat in us the extra heat has to be transported by the blood to the skin and lungs were the heat is given of to the environment
