commutative algebra ring homomorphisms my notes commutative algebra rings ring homomorphisms ideals nilpotent elements prime and maximal ideals posets maximal ideals local rings factorization the nilradical the jacobson radical operations on ideals direct sums ideal quotients radicals extension and contraction exercises modules submodules and quotient modules operations on submodules direct sums and products finitely generated modules and free modules exact sequences ring homomorphisms a mapping f r &rightarrow s where r s are rings is a ring homomorphism if f 1 1 for all x y &element r we have f x y f x f y f x y f x f y it is easily verified that if f is a ring homomorphism then f 0 0 f x f x for all x &element r the image of f f r f x &verticalbar x &element r is a subring of s also it is clear that the composition of ring homomorphisms is also a ring homomorphism an isomorphism is a bijective homomorphism if f r &rightarrow s is an isomorphism we write r s note that isomorphism is an equivalence relation my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
