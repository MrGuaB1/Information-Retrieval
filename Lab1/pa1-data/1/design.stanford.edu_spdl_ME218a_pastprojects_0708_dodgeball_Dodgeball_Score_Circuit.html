scoreboard circuit scoreboard circuit to detect a hit we use the following circuit because the hit is an impact and so happens very quickly we include a capacitor to ensure that the voltage is still high enough to provide a logic level high when the c32 checks for the hit event the clock is implemented in c code when the time is about to run out in order to alert the player a led and buzzer are activated using the following circuits the 8 segment displays were the most exciting to implement a multiplexing shift register strategy is used so only 4 pins would be necessary to run all 16 of the led segments of the scoreboard every 100 times the code cycles a refresh display function is called which turns off the display that is currently on shifts in a new 8 bit character and turns on the other display the code is so fast that the 50 duty cycle of the displays appears to be a constant glow to the naked eye unfortunately the displays are common cathode which requires us to source 14 volts to each channel and so build 8 transistor circuits one for each bit of an 8 segment display two more transistors were used to turn each display on or off made on a mac
