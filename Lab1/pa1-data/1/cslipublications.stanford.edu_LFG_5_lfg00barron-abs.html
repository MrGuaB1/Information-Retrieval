barron abs the morphosyntactic correlates of finiteness julia barron abstract in this paper i question the traditional view of the notion finiteness rather than being a morphosyntactic feature i argue that if anything it is a semantic category related to time reference and definiteness furthermore i attempt to abandon the rather misleading labels of ofiniteo and onon finiteo verb forms by offering evidence from english romance and japanese which reveal that verb forms may have morphological tense despite having no independent time reference i propose a realisational theory of morphology in the spirit of anderson 1992 and stump forthcoming in which the shapes of verb forms are the expression of particular configurations of features at f structure involving tense aspect modality and subordination for example i show that to infinitives like subjunctives and modal verbs are prototypical expressions of irrealis modality while a tensed form in an italian perception verb complement may be used to unambiguously express imperfective aspect
