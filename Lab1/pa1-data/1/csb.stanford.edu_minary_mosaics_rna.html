exploring rna structure space movies accompanying exploring rna structure space with natural move sampling small symmetric rna benchmark we used a small symmetric rna to benchmark different methods used to sample rna the vidoes below show that by including more move sets in hierarchical sampling we improve sampling efficiency more diverse conformations are quickly explored move set l 1 only move sets l 1 l 4 this small system is also useful to learn how to define hierarchical move sets in mosaics and hence we have compiled a simple tutorial here large symmetric rna our approach is not restricted to only simpled rna systems but can tackle large and complex molecular assemblies as well due to the complexity of the system systematic incorporation of collective motions are essential for sampling a large symmetric rna this effect is more pronounced in this case than the previous simpler and smaller rna where saturation of sampling efficiency was quickly observed with respect to adding sampling degrees of freedom move sets l 1 l 4 move sets l 1 l 7 future and current work ribosome in our paper we applied hierarchical move sets to model rna but since the implementation of our method is general hybrid systems can also be easily modeled here we illustrate how this can be done on the ribosome that consists of protein and rna structural elements each molecular subunit color coded panel a can be moved independently and further molecular moves can be incorporated within each subunit eg boxed panel b rna junctions with the freedom in defining different hierarhical collective motions we can systematically study the effects of rna junction types on conformational flexibility contact adelene stanford edu
