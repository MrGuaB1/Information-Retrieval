commutative algebra direct sums and products my notes commutative algebra rings ring homomorphisms ideals nilpotent elements prime and maximal ideals posets maximal ideals local rings factorization the nilradical the jacobson radical operations on ideals direct sums ideal quotients radicals extension and contraction exercises modules submodules and quotient modules operations on submodules direct sums and products finitely generated modules and free modules exact sequences direct sums and products let m i &verticalbar i &element i be a family of r modules define the direct product by i &element i m i x i i &element i &verticalbar x i &element m i the direct product inherits an r module structure by defining the operations coordinatewise direct sums of modules i &element i m i are defined in the same way except only finitely many of the coordinates of the tuples are nonzero thus if i is finite direct sums and products are the same we say m is the internal direct sum of the family if m &sum m i and m j &sum i j m i 0 my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
