commutative algebra exact sequences my notes commutative algebra rings ring homomorphisms ideals nilpotent elements prime and maximal ideals posets maximal ideals local rings factorization the nilradical the jacobson radical operations on ideals direct sums ideal quotients radicals extension and contraction exercises modules submodules and quotient modules operations on submodules direct sums and products finitely generated modules and free modules exact sequences exact sequences let r be a ring a sequence &rightarrow m i 1 &rightarrow f i 1 m i &rightarrow f i m i 1 &rightarrow of r modules and r module homomorphisms is exact at m i if im f i 1 ker f i the sequence is exact if it is exact at every m i for example 0 &rightarrow m &rightarrow f m is exact if and only if f is injective m &rightarrow g m &rightarrow 0 is exact if and only if g is surjective 0 &rightarrow m &rightarrow f m &rightarrow g m &rightarrow 0 is exact if and only if f is injective g is surjective and im f ker g that is coker f m we can think of m as an extension of m by m a sequence of this form is called a short exact sequence exact sequences that are infinite in both directions are called long exact sequences suppose we have a long exact sequence &rightarrow m i 1 &rightarrow f i 1 m i &rightarrow f i m i 1 &rightarrow set n i 1 im f i ker f i 1 then we may form short exact sequences 0 &rightarrow n i &rightarrow m i &rightarrow n i 1 &rightarrow 0 conversely given short exact sequences of this type we can form a long exact sequence theorem 1 m &rightarrow u m &rightarrow v m &rightarrow 0 is exact &iff for all r modules n 0 &rightarrow hom m n &rightarrow v &overbar hom m n &rightarrow u &overbar hom m n is exact 2 0 &rightarrow n &rightarrow u &rightarrow v n is exact &iff for all r modules m 0 &rightarrow hom m n &rightarrow u &overbar hom m n &rightarrow v &overbar hom m n is exact proof exercise my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
