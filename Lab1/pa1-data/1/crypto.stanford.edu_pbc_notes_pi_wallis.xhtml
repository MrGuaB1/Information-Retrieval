pi the wallis product my notes pi proof that pi is irrational the gregory leibniz series the wallis product ramanujan's formula for pi computing pi in c the wallis product  2 2 1 2 3 4 3 4 5 6 5 proof let a n &integral 0  2 sin x n dx since 0 sin x 1 for 0 x  2 it follows that a n is a decreasing sequence integrating by parts a n sin x n 1 cos x &verticalbar 0  2 &integral 0  2 n 1 sin x n 2 cos 2 x dx 0 &integral 0  2 n 1 sin x n 2 1 sin 2 x dx thus a n n 1 a n 2 n 1 a n that is a n n 1 n a n 2 we have that a 0  2 and a 1 1 applying the recurrence relation yields a 2 n  2 1 2 3 4 2 n 1 2 n and a 2 n 1 2 3 4 5 2 n 2 n 1 since a n is a decreasing sequence 1 a 2 n a 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 a 2 n 1 1 1 2 n therefore as n &rightarrow the ratio a 2 n a 2 n 1 &rightarrow 1 hence  2 1 3 5 &ctdot 2 n 1 2 4 6 &ctdot 2 n 3 5 7 &ctdot 2 n 1 2 4 6 &ctdot 2 n &rightarrow 1 my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
