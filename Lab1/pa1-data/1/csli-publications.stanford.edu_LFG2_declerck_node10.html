structure rules next up previous next the resulting type system up migrated resources previous lexicon entries structure rules in the next section we can see the context free backbone of alep the formulation of the rules is straightforward but it was not possible to preserve the compact formulation of the rules of the source grammar since optionality for example had to be spelled out in different rules the number of rules in the target grammar increased a lot a way to keep the rule system compact can be found with the use of macros see the documentation of the final version of the core grammar dc wp6e available under http www iai uni sb de ls gram papers html or to use boolean feature types in both cases the migration has to be done in two steps one step for the straightforward porting of the rules and one step for the transformation of lfg specific expressions including the annotations into alep constructs in the next rules the mother daughter relation is represented through a the daughter are collected in a list see the square brackets as an example the following rule d d np which seems to be complex but this is due only to the immediate translation of the lfg rule into alep for this reason one should make an intensive use of macros for her grammar design in alep with the use of the variables it is possible to reproduce the structure sharings formulated in the source grammar the feature distribution corresponds to the one resulting from the ups and downs arrows in lfg sign syn n_syntax cat np agr a sem n_sem string s rest r sign syn a_syntax cat ap agr a sem a_sem string s rest s1 sign syn n_syntax cat np agr a sem n_sem string s1 rest r one can also see how the the names of the features of the source grammar have been introduced into a type system thierry declerck sat sep 6 17 29 07 met dst 1997
