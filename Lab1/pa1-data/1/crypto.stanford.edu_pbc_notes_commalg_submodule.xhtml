commutative algebra submodules and quotient modules my notes commutative algebra rings ring homomorphisms ideals nilpotent elements prime and maximal ideals posets maximal ideals local rings factorization the nilradical the jacobson radical operations on ideals direct sums ideal quotients radicals extension and contraction exercises modules submodules and quotient modules operations on submodules direct sums and products finitely generated modules and free modules exact sequences submodules and quotient modules a submodule m of a r module m is a subgroup of m that is closed under scalar multiplication the quotient group m m becomes an r module by defining a x m a x m the r module m m is the quotient of m by m the natural map m &rightarrow m m given by x &rightarrow x m is a surjective module homomorphism and it induces a bijection between submodules of m m and submodules of m that contain m let f m &rightarrow n be a module homomorphism the kernel of f ker f x &element m &verticalbar f x 0 is a submodule of m the image of f is im f f m f x &verticalbar x &element m is a submodule of n the cokernel of f is coker f n im f let m be a submodule of m contained in ker f then f induces a homomorphism f &overbar m m &rightarrow n given by x m &map f x note ker f &overbar ker f m if m ker f we have the fundamental homomorphism theorem for modules m ker f im f my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
