homepage of esp software welcome to the homepage of esp software stanford university we are in the process of adding new material to the site please check here often home graphical command line suzi this is the home of esp software developed by wc reynolds improved in collaboration with jl lumley and featured in lumley's introductory book on internal combustion engines published in 1999 by the cambridge university press esp calculates the thermodynamic performance of a homogeneous charge spark ignition engine using a zero dimensional model ordinary differential equations with one in cylinder zone during gas exchange compression and expansion and two zones during combustion it uses a one equation ode turbulence model to track the large scale turbulent kinetic energy and uses this turbulence velocity in heat transfer and combustion models the manifold gasdynamic model uses odes based on the method of characteristics and models for the acoustic time delays esp can be used to study various valve and piston programs various fuels and oxidixers effects of turbulence impact of reduced heat heat transfer manifold tuning spark timing and other design options last updated on 01.4 2001
