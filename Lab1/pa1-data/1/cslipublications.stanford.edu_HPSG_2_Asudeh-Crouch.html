glue semantics for hpsg glue semantics for hpsg ash asudeh and richard crouch stanford university and xerox parc xerox parc the glue approach to semantic interpretation has been developed principally for lexical functional grammar recent work has shown how glue can be used with a variety of syntactic theories and this paper outlines how it can be applied to hpsg as well as providing an alternative form of semantics for hpsg we believe that the benefits of hpsg glue include the following 1 simplification of the semantics principle 2 a simple and elegant treatment of modifier scope including empirical phenomena like quantifier scope ambiguity the interaction of scope with raising and recursive modification 3 an analysis of control that handles agreement between controlled subjects and their coarguments while allowing for a property denotation for the controlled clause 4 re use of highly efficient techniques for semantic derivation already implemented for lfg and which target problems of ambiguity management also addressed by minimal recursion semantics
