stanford security seminar stanford security seminar logo information flow types for homomorphic encryptions jeremy planul abstract we develop a flexible information flow type system for a range of encryption primitives precisely reflecting their diverse functional and security features we obtain a uniform framework for understanding their properties and for automatically checking their usage in cryptographic protocols and programs our rules enable encryption blinding homomorphic computation and decryption with selective key re use for different types of payloads we show that under standard cryptographic assumptions any well typed probabilistic program using encryptions is secure that is computationally non interferent against active adversaries both for confidentiality and integrity we illustrate our approach using elgamal and paillier encryption we present two applications of cryptographic verification by typing 1 private search on data streams and 2 the bootstrapping part of gentry's fully homomorphic encryption time and place oct 27 2011 thursday at 1630 hrs gates 463a stanford security seminar
