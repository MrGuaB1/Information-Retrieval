polya theory polya's inventory theorem my notes polya theory group actions burnside's lemma the cycle index polynomial polya's inventory theorem polya's inventory theorem you may have guessed we can do more otherwise we would have simply written x instead of each x i in the cycle index polynomial we can now easily solve our original problem so let's make it harder how many 10 bead necklaces can you make out of 2 red beads 3 green beads and 5 blue beads to answer questions like these we borrow techniques from generating functions first we define weights for each colour denoted by w we might pick w r x w g w b 1 the weight of a colouring  x &rightarrow c is the product of the weights of each bead w  x &element x w  x for example w rgbrgb x 2 and more generally a colouring has exactly two red beads if and only if its weight is x 2 colourings in the same orbit have the same weight allowing us to define the weight of an orbit to be the weight of any one of its members we define the pattern inventory i to be the sum of the weighted orbits i &sum  &element s w  where s is the set of all orbits in our example the coefficient of x 2 would then be the number of necklaces with exactly two red beads exercise prove the weighted burnside lemma i 1 &verticalbar g &verticalbar &sum g &element g &sum  &element  w  g   which leads to theorem polya's inventory theorem i p g x p 1 p n where &verticalbar x &verticalbar n and p k &sum c &element c w c k the k th power sum of the weights in particular for our problem we compute p the cyclic index polynomial of the dihedral group of order 20 and choose the weights w r x w g y w b z then we want the coefficient of x 2 y 3 z 5 in i p x y z x 10 y 10 z 10 20 1 x y z 10 x 2 y 2 z 2 5 4 x 5 y 5 z 5 2 4 x 10 y 10 z 10 5 x y z 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 4 5 x 2 y 2 z 2 5 thus the answer is 20 1 10 2 3 5 5 2 4 1 1 2 132 my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
