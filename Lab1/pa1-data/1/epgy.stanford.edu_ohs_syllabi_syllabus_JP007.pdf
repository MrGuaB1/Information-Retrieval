jp007 inquiry based physics page 1 jp007 inquiry based physics course description jp007 is a one year inquiry based physics course covering the elements of newtonian physics and elements of electricity & magnetism being an inquiry based course jp007 will primarily involve students exploration of basic principles of physics discussions may also involve ancillary topics like astrophysics nature of the universe and current research results throughout this process various skills will be enhanced in addition certain key skills to succeed in further science and physics courses will be developed these include but are not limited to multidimensional representation of phenomena graphical analysis basic concepts of uncertainty vectors and modeling physical phenomena in more than one way these objectives and skills should allow the student to easily succeed when proceeding on to more advanced presentations of physics semester 1 what is physics defining and classifying objects processes properties and interactions measuring properties of objects and systems characteristic properties of substances measuring changes of basic properties in time kinematics define rules relating to changes of state deduction prediction and verification by experiment semester 2 having understood the process now apply to new unfamiliar systems defining and classifying types of energy what remains the same conservation principles energy and momentum applying principles to electrical & magnetic phenomena further explorations in physics occurs throughout the year course objectives learning objectives ability to design and conduct an experiment to explore a basic physics principle or law identify questions and concepts that guide investigation recognize and analyze alternative explanations and models communicate and defend a scientific argument work in groups and communicate well develop multiple explanations of effects learn process to carefully observe record and analyze new potentially unfamiliar phenomena learn to distill fundamental parameters of observations develop conceptual models of observations and test for correctness of proposed models 1 page 2 specific goals represent data in various formats graphical tabular vector etc interpret graphical evidence understand the fundamental role of uncertainties and errors in observations and distinguish such issues from theoretical models understand the independence of motion in perpendicular directions understand that certain properties have a magnitude and a direction and require vectors to represent them distinguish quantities that are properties of objects from those that pertain to interactions between objects and to correctly identify those interactions ie forces required text head first physics by heather lang isbn 978 0 596 10237 1 course assessments class participation assignments average of one per week quizzes average 2 per semester experiments approximately 10 per semester students will spend one to two weeks on each experiment and will develop skill in maintaining a lab notebook final exam there will be a comprehensive proctored final exam at the end of each semester 2
