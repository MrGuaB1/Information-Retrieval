ee469b rf pulse design for magnetic resonance imaging ee469b rf pulse design for magnetic resonance imaging fall quarter 2009 course description magnetic resonance imaging mri and spectroscopy mrs are both based on the use of radio frequency pulses to manipulate magnetization this course will cover the analysis and design of the major types of rf pulses in one and multiple dimensions the analysis and design of sequences of rf pulses for fast imaging and the use of rf pulses for the creation of image contrast in mri instructor john pauly information systems laboratory packard electrical engineering 258 650 723 4569 650 723 8473 fax pauly stanford edu class time and location 12 50 2 05 mw green earth sciences room 131 click on the link for a map that you can zoom in and out a better map for metered parking is shown on this map as the green capital p's bring lots of quarters office hours 10 12 tuesday required text handbook of mri pulse sequences bernstein king and zhou elsevier wiley 2004 this should be in the bookstore you can get it from amazon here this is an excellent book which anyone working an mri will want to have course outline a list of the topics that will be covered is given here in the order that they will be covered this may change based on class interest and time grading weekly assignments consisting of problem sets and matlab programming 50 of the grade a final project this will be a one page abstract and a 10 15 minute oral presentation or a 10 15 page report 50 of the grade announcements jason su discovered that stanford associated people can access a free pdf version of the bernstein book the link is here thanks jason class handouts pdf week 1 notes for sept 21 characteristics of rf notes for sept 23 small tip angle excitation and excitation k space the first assignment is here and the source files here week 2 notes for sept 28 examples of k space excitation pulses and the relationship between excitation and reception notes for sept 30 k space solution for small tip angle excitation and 2d spiral pulse design the second assignment is here and the source files here week 3 notes for oct 5 practical issues in 2d spiral pulse design notes for oct 7 2d epi pulse design the third assignment is here and the source files here if you are having trouble with the voronoidens m function the kp and dp variables are here or here in matlab version 6 format week 4 notes for oct 12 spectral spatial pulse design solutions for assignment 1 are here and the mfiles here notes for oct 14 representations of rotations the fourth assignment is here and the source files here week 5 notes for oct 19 getting in and out of the spin domain solutions for assignment 2 are here notes for oct 21 the shinnar le roux transform the fifth assignment is here and the source files here week 6 notes for oct 26 designing large tip angle 1d pulses with the shinnar le roux algorithm notes for oct 28 designing the beta polynomial the sixth assignment is here and the source files here week 7 today we will finish the notes for oct 28 designing the beta polynomial solutions for assignment 3 and 4 are here and here notes for nov 4 adiabatic inversion pulses the seventh assignment is here just send me a couple sentences about which project you are interested in week 8 notes for nov 9 adiabatic rotations notes for nov 9 small rotation solution week 9 notes for nov 16 large tip angle epi and spectral spatial pulses notes for nov 18 short t2 imaging and contrast week 10 notes for nov 30 parallel transmit solutions for assignment 5 and 6 are here and here notes for dec 2 parallel excitation conclusion final project presenstations directions and guidelines for the final presentation are here note that this is a different room not the lecture room last updated dec 2 2009
