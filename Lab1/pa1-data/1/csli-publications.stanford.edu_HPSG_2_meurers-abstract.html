to flip or not to flip on the nature of irregularities in the german verbal complex to flip or not to flip on the nature of irregularities in the german verbal complex w detmar meurers the ohio state university this paper challenges the assumption that the nature of apparent word order and verb form irregularities in the german verbal complex is that of an irreducible cluster of idiosyncrasies surrounding an exceptional word order possibility i discuss two lesser known sets of data which raise serious problems for the traditional idiosyncrasy based analysis i conclude that the verbs in the upper field are exceptional in a deeper sense in that they do not construct as ordinary syntactic heads instead they seem to behave more like functional elements as characterized by abney 1987 on the basis of such a revised syntactic analysis most of the unexpected word order and verb form irregularities resurface as related regular properties
