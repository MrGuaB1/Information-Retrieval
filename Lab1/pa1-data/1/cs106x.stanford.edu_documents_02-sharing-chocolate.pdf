sharing chocolate page 1 cs106b and cs106x handout yummy autumn 2011 october 26th 2011 sharing chocolate sharing chocolate consider a chocolate bar consisting of 3 x 4 segments you can break the chocolate bar along any of the divisions between the rows or columns of the bar creating two bars that themselves can be recursively split in the same manner a specific question can the 3 x 4 chocolate bar be split into 4 pieces with 1 2 3 and 6 segments the more general question can an m by n chocolate bar 1 m n 100 be split into p pieces 1 p 15 with a1 a2 a3 ap 1 and ap segments the problem can be solved using recursive backtracking and memoization and while challenging it's accessible to everyone since we ve covered both topics in lecture it's possible to use recursive backtracking alone but the memoization can be used to remember common sub problems and bring an exponential running time solution down to a polynomial one even 100 x 100 chocolate bars can be recursively divided to discover the desired split in less than a second input the data needs to be read in from a file named sharing chocolate in the input file consists of multiple test cases each describing a chocolate bar each description starts with a line containing two integers which are the dimensions of a chocolate bar the next line contains a list of unsorted integers which are the sizes of the segments the end of input is the end of file ie an attempt to read two integers would bring an ifstream into a fail state output for each test case simply output yes or no one per line with no additional white space naturally print yes if the desired split is possible and print no otherwise sample input 3 4 1 2 3 6 5 5 6 4 9 6 2 3 1 5 sample output yes yes no
