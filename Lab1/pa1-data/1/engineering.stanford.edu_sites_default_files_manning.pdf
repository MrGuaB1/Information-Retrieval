lighten overload page 1 information technology with language understanding david orenstein for people who despair that there is too much information online chris manning has an answer technology is not the problem in fact it understands at the annual conference of the american association for the advancement of science in san diego in february the stanford associate professor of computer science and linguistics talked about enabling computers to process human language well enough to use the information it conveys the problem of the age is information overload said manning the fundamental challenge i m addressing how we can get computers to actually understand at least a reasonable amount of what they read as computers make more sense of what's online they could deliver more relevant search results and help summarize structure and act on information that individuals care about much like a personal assistant a smartphone e mail program that understands the difference between we need the q4 figures and we found the q4 figures could alert a busy executive to an urgent matter and apprise her of its resolution computers could also help researchers extract key facts from articles to create and update databases in fact manning has developed software that mines biology research papers for basic data state of the art manning readily acknowledges that the field of natural language understanding has a long way to go to catch up with popular imagination the state of the art is still highly incomplete he says we re just not at the level of what we see in science fiction movies but human language technology has been making enormous advances in his aaas talk manning described work on three emerging technologies at stanford's natural language processing group nlpg working with linguistics professor dan jurafsky manning has been developing a fundamental set of tools to help computers do what as computers make more sense of what's online they could deliver more relevant search results and help summarize structure and act on information that individuals care about much like a personal assistant lighten overload computers could information page 2 inforamtion technology a pupil does in grammar school parse sentences like with humans computers begin to understand sentences by recognizing parts of speech and how the sentence is structured the underlying technology however is a branch of artificial intel ligence called probabilistic machine learning essentially computers are programmed to read a large number of sentences and then analyze their structure and elements compiling statistics about how often what they see seems to be a verb or a noun and what the subject of the sentence is doing based on those statistics for instance a computer would conclude that horse is likely to be a noun and even that horses eat hay techni cal demonstrations of manning and jurafsky's language parsing software are available on the nlp group web site nlp stanford edu building on that level of understanding manning's group has created software to sort out ambiguities in language by taking whole sentences into account when deciding what each word means for instance make up can have two or three meanings to reconcile to concoct or cosmetics with the space missing the technical solution called joint inference is to look for other words in the sentence that are statistically shown to be relevant if the word argument is there the computer will lean toward to reconcile finally manning discussed a technology called robust textual inference which can read a passage of text and determine whether a conclusion about it is supported that reading comprehension task is important because it's very similar to what people sometimes expect search engines to do they ll type in a conclusion hotels with free wi fi and hope the engine leads them to text that supports it free wireless high speed internet access in all rooms with tremendous volumes of information appearing online every day in social networks manning says the need to train computers to under stand human language rather than meticulously structured data is only increasing the next research frontier may therefore be getting a computer to understand cu soon qt with tremendous volumes of information appearing online every day in social networks the need to train computers to understand human language rather than meticulously structured data is only increasing associate professor chris manning soe stanford edu research profiles profile_more php g 72 march 2010 erload
