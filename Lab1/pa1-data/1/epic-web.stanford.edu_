epic the stanford epic project efficiency & proportionality in the cloud main menu main research people publications events wiki the epic project the energy efficient data center projects aims at unveiling techniques that will allow energy efficiency at the large scale without having a negative impact on the system's performance when computing power reached billions of users via affordable internet enabled handhelds information became ubiquitous and at the same time distributed and easily compromised the solution to this came through centralized datacenters dc which in their effort to reconcile performance and power constraints became the most challenging systems to design this project has the goal to develop energy efficient dcs that will not compromise the system's performance or quality of service in order to do that a number of areas should be examined some of those are workload acquisition and characterization scalable power management techniques storage system design scalable interconnection network solutions reconfigurable hardware heterogeneity as the project progresses we hope to delve into each of those areas as well as investigate the correlation between them and report back useful results for the computer architecture community contact epic web team copyright 2010 epic web team design by stylish website templates
