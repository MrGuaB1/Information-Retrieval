robotic perception via contact robotic perception via contact humans are capable of performing many tasks relying just on the sense of touch to enable robots to do the same we explore robotic perception via contact by sensing the object with the end effector we are able to determine the object's position and orientation with very high precision this allows us to perform fine manipulation tasks such as picking up a box and manipulating a door handle taking this a step further we want robots to utilize information from contacts made along entire length of manipulator links new videos june 2011 these videos start with tactile probing procedure which has been sped up x8 the robot localizes the object based on the tactile data and begins the interaction scenario which is shown in real time puma using a cash register puma playing a guitar puma toasting bagels videos note these videos have been sped up for better viewing puma robot picking up a box fully autonomous experiment stair robot opening a door in this experiment probing and manipulation of the door handle are autonomous but motion of the mobile platform is controlled with a joystick estimating link contact the contact is estimated using active sensing strategy and geometric constraints see icra07 paper below estimating contact in a multi contact scenario the experiment shows that the same active sensing strategy can be used with multiple contacts relevant publications towards dependable robotic perception anna petrovskaya phd thesis computer science department stanford university june 2011 pdf global localization of objects via touch anna petrovskaya and oussama khatib ieee transactions on robotics vol 27 3 pp 569 585 june 2011 pdf ieee version more guaranteed inference for global state estimation in human environments anna petrovskaya sebastian thrun daphne koller and oussama khatib mmw pdf drhe pdf touch based perception for object manipulation anna petrovskaya oussama khatib sebastian thrun and andrew y ng robotics science and systems conference rss robot manipulation workshop atlanta ga 2007 pdf probabilistic estimation of whole body contacts for multi contact robot control anna petrovskaya jaeheung park oussama khatib ieee international conference on robotics and automation icra rome italy 2007 pdf bayesian estimation for autonomous object manipulation based on tactile sensors anna petrovskaya oussama khatib sebastian thrun and andrew y ng ieee international conference on robotics and automation icra orlando florida 2006 pdf also poster version from wiml06 ppt back to my homepage
