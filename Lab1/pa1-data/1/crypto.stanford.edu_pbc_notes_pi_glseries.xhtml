pi the gregory leibniz series my notes pi proof that pi is irrational the gregory leibniz series the wallis product ramanujan's formula for pi computing pi in c the gregory leibniz series  4 1 1 3 1 5 1 7 proof start with the taylor series 1 1 y 1 y y 2 apply the variable substitution y x 2 to get 1 1 x 2 1 x 2 x 4 x 6 now since d dx tan 1 x 1 1 x 2 by integrating we find that the taylor expansion of tan 1 x is tan 1 x x x 3 3 x 5 5 and the formula is obtained by substituting x 1 variations the gregory leibniz series converges very slowly one way to improve it is to use tan 1 1 3  6 1 3 1 1 3 3 1 5 3 2 1 7 3 3 even better is tan 1 1 tan 1 1 2 tan 1 1 3 1 2 1 1 3 2 2 1 5 2 4 1 3 1 1 3 3 2 1 5 3 4 another way that is handy for decimal digits is tan 1 1 4 tan 1 1 5 tan 1 1 239 my homepage email blynn pleasedontspamme at cs dot stanford dot edu
