circuit schematic of phototransistor with op amp lm324 circuit schematic of phototransistor with op amp lm324 with the golden rule no current is drawn into the op amp or comparator rewrite with the below r1 3.3 k vnon inverting 4.8 v i current is determined by the amount of light that shines into the ir photodetector as shown from the phototransistor data sheet here the waveform will look like this v non inverting i r 1 v out time volts design calculation for the high pass circuit figure 8 circuit schematic of high pass filter calculating the tau or 63 rise time 63 rise time corner frequency note this frequency is below the target frequency of the beacons at 1.25 khz v center 2.5 v time volts v out design calculation for the comparator with hysteresis circuit figure 9 circuit schematic of comparator lm339 upward going voltage past state v point_b v ref_div note is res hysteresis in figure 9 downward going voltage past state v point_b v ref_div values calculated note for our rpullup we did not include it in the above calculations because rpullup for example 330k and if we did the calculations again we would only need to modify one locations with a and a rpullup in series which is 332.2 k instead v center 2.5 v time volts v l ow_threshold v high _threshold this takes the above signal from point b and converts it to the below signal 5volts 0volts time volts v out
