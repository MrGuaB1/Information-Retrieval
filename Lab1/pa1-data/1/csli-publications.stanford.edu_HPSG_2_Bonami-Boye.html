suppletion html suppletion and dependency in inflectional morphology olivier bonami & gilles boye this paper presents a general approach to verbal inflection with special emphasis on suppletion phenomena the paper focuses on french but the approach is general enough to apply to a wide variety of languages in the first part of the paper we show that suppletion is not erratic suppletive forms tend to always appear in groups in definite areas of verbal paradigms our analysis is based on the observation of a number of dependency relations between inflectional forms of verbs somewhat similar to rules of referral zwicky 1985 stump 1993 we define for each language a stem dependency tree based on these observations which allows one to predict the whole paradigm of every verb in the language on the basis of a minimal number of idiosyncratic stems we use the tree to minimize the quantity of redundant phonological information that has to be listed in the lexicon for a given lexeme assuming that an optimal analysis of inflection should be able to derive all and only intuitively predictable inflectional forms from a single representation the second part of the paper attempts to integrate the analysis in an hpsg hierarchical lexicon morphological dependency relations are represented directly by mentioning a lexical sign in another sign's lexical entry the approach to suppletion proposed in the first part is made explicit using a combination of online type construction and default constraints on the phonology of dependent signs
