the reliable router the reliable router a reliable and high performance communication substrate for parallel computers project summary the reliable router rr is a high performance routing chip currently under development at the mit concurrent vlsi architecture group the chip is targeted to two dimensional network topologies the rr uses adaptive routing in combination with a unique token protocol to tolerate a single non transient node or link failure anywhere in the network without interruption of service other unique features of the reliable router include a full featured diagnostic interface a low latency plesiochronous physical channel architecture and simultaneous bidirectional signalling relevant references are listed in the publications section the target clock frequency of the reliable router is 100 mhz unidirectional link bandwidth is expected to reach 3.2 gbit sec the estimated die size is approximately 15mm x 16mm and the estimated transistor count is 600000 the rr will be fabricated by mosis in a 1 micron 3 metal layer process the planned tapeout date is january 31st 1995 publications the reliable router a reliable and high performance communication substrate for parallel computers appears in the proceedings of the first international parallel computer routing and communication workshop seattle wa may 1994 architecture and implementation of the reliable router appears in the proceedings of hot interconnects ii stanford ca august 1994 low latency plesiochronous data retiming to appear in the proceedings of the 1995 advanced research in vlsi conference chapel hill nc march 1995 high performance bidirectional signalling in vlsi systems appears in the proceedings of the 1993 symposium on research on integrated systems seattle wa january 1993 the reliable router team faculty supervisor bill dally graduate students larry dennison duke xanthopoulos undergraduate students jeff bowers dan hartman past members kin hong kan david harris ivan oei peter nuth duke ai mit edu
