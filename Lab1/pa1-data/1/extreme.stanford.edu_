stanford entrepreneurial design for extreme affordability entrepreneurial design students changing the lives of the world's poor a paradigm shift has begun designers and engineers have tired of making products that only serve a tiny fraction of the world's population businesspeople are working to leverage the power of business models to do good in the world philanthropists are looking for ways make charity more sustainable and social entrepreneurs all over the globe are experimenting with innovative ways to do their job better when we bring these people together exciting things happen lots of individuals want to help the poor but we believe that problems like poverty disease and hunger are so big and complicated that no single kind of person has all the necessary tools the really innovative solutions are discovered and implemented through radical collaboration between diverse individuals from different backgrounds disciplines and cultures we help these innovators rally around a common design process appreciate cultural contexts develop deep empathy prototype and iterate ideas rapidly and sometimes reframe the problem entirely it's not long before unexpected ideas begin to take shape what's our mission to treat the poor as customers not as charity recipients we believe in listening to the needs the poor not assuming we know best we believe in products and services designed for specific cultural contexts not just western hand me downs and we believe that careful attention to design can create innovative and extremely affordable solutions to the problems of the world's poor d school d school d school d school 2010 stanford university institute of design all rights reserved terms of use
