untitled document speaker setup our speaker circuit uses a pwm signal with an irlz34n power mosfet to produce sounds by turning the speaker on and off at a specific frequency the 34n handled both the power and control of the circuit we used an 8 ohm speaker in series with a 20 ohm resistor modeled as a 28 ohm resistor in the diagram the overall resistance was 8 ohm speaker+ 20 ohm resistor+ 0.046 rdson negligible leading to i v r 179 ma power dissipated in the speaker was i 2 r 0.255 w
