polygon rendering imagine architecture programming performance vlsi board applications tools depth mpeg rendering polygon rendering modern commercial graphics processors have hardwired graphics pipelines that implement a given api recently these processors have added programmable elements to their pipelines we take the opposite approach we begin with imagine a fully programmable processor and implement a polygon rendering pipeline on it our research centers around the following goals we are developing algorithms which exploit our simd architecture and fit elegantly into the stream programming model our algorithms make efficient and high performance use of stream programming hardware we explore the advantages of the stream processing approach compare our machine organization against current graphics processors our organization reduces load imbalance and amortizes the cost of programmability over all stages exploit our greater amount of programmability reduce or eliminate the need for multipass easily map our pipeline to a shading language our first polygon rendering pipeline is described in this paper presented at the siggraph eurographics workshop on graphics hardware 2000 slides from this presentation recently we have been collaborating with the stanford real time programmable shading project mapping their real time shading language onto imagine figure 1 shows example scenes rendered on the imagine simulator using the real time shading language figure 1 scenes rendered with imagine and the real time shading language gajh cva stanford edu
