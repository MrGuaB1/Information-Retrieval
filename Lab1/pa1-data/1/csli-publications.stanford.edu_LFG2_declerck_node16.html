concluding remarks and future work next up previous next references up no title previous the integration of le concluding remarks and future work insisting more on the linguistic engineering aspects of grammar development in the second half of this paper i presented some works done within the context of the ls gram project in connection with the alep platform there i showed how the integration of external linguistic engineering tools like document processing morphological analysis part of speech taggers can have a significant influence on coverage and performance of alep grammars also the design of the grammars has to be reconsidered in the light of this kind of operation from this we might be able to follow that generally the linguistic descriptions of unification based grammars have to be adapted for the sake of efficiency in the setting of a possible industrial application the migration between formalisms could be easier since it will apply only to this simplified linguistic descriptions generic entries reduced set of rules and templates etc in a future work it will be investigated if the design of a general interface between document processing and linguistic description is possible for other grammar development platforms working within the paradigm of unification based formalisms this particularly for the xle environment platform at the end of this experiment about the reusability of lfg resources we are concerned with the more general question about the reusability of linguistic engineering resources for unification based grammars thierry declerck sat sep 6 17 29 07 met dst 1997
