operaglass la boheme the richter scale la boheme by giacomo puccini presented by san francisco opera directed by mark lamos conducted by steven mercurio at the orpheum theatre 1192 market st san francisco 415 864 3330 reviewed by judy richter the san francisco opera faced with the need to vacate its home in the san francisco opera house this year is capitalizing on the situation in a creative manner by presenting puccini's evergreen la boheme broadway style in the nearby orpheum theater the opera house has been closed for remodeling and seismic upgrades since january it will reopen for the start of the sfo's 75th season in september 1997 in a fitting celebration of la boheme's 100th anniversary sfo is fielding multiple casts to present eight performances a week through june 30 thanks to a grant from the ann and gordon getty foundation ticket prices also are broadway style ranging from $20 to $65 considerably less than the usual cost of an opera ticket in yet another bow to broadway sfo has hired mark lamos who has numerous theatrical credits as production director lamos and his design team michael yergin sets walter mahoney costumes and thomas j munn lighting have created a believable atmosphere for puccini's band of impoverished bohemians in the latin quarter of paris hence the garret shared by rodolfo marcello colline and schaunard is dingy and cramped almost too cramped when the four begin dancing in act 4 on the other hand this small space defined by photos of the building's exterior allows act 1 to flow almost seamlessly into act 2 as the photographic panels lift or slide away to reveal the festive cafe momus setting act 3 the courtyard scene is more conventional using the full width of the stage the orpheum which has heretofore been used occasionally for the best of broadway series proves relatively hospitable to opera it's a pleasure to hear unmiked voices fill the house unlike the overamplified voices one often hears at musicals here to accommodate sfo's needs the orchestra pit has been enlarged fresh paint is obvious in the lobbies and rest rooms opening night june 7 featured a cast of young singers who added further credence to the tragic story of young love ended by death soprano patricia racette was a touching believable mimi like more than two thirds of her colleagues for this run of boheme racette is a graduate of the san francisco opera center's training programs hence san francisco audiences have had a chance to watch her and the others advance in their careers racette who also is becoming a regular at the met has always been a singer to watch with her pure tones and right on pitch she shapes her performances with taste and intelligence in the past her voice hasn t always been big enough to fill a house but now it is showing greater power as well as richer undertones with no loss of purity or clarity consequently she delivered a sterling utterly affecting performance her rodolfo was italian tenor marcello giordani last heard here in the 1994 lucia di lammermoor giordani has an ardent fluid style but he sometimes lacks finesse singing too loudly or making no apparent effort to blend in ensembles nevertheless his performance was well received soprano nicolle foland who was scheduled to sing the following night stepped in on opening night to replace the indisposed ann panagulias as musetta panagulias reportedly sang her next scheduled performance though her voice has yet to mature into its full power foland is a rising star who acquitted herself beautifully as the fiery coquette earle patriarco though a bit stiff sang the role of marcello in a fluid resonant baritone hector vasquez as schaunard and philip skinner as colline made strong contributions the production was marred somewhat by steven mercurio's lackluster conducting which resulted in a so so orchestral performance and sometimes found the orchestra and singers out of synch likewise the sfo chorus was good but not up to its usual high standards in act 2 mercurio shares the podium with marco armiliato and ian robertson during the run overall though this was a noteworthy production one that could bring new audiences to the world of opera for ticket information see the san francisco opera home page operaglass main page monday 08 dec 2003 21 44 21 pst
