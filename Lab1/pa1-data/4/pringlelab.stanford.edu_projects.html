pringle lab projects lab logo people projects pictures publications protocols places play summaries of lab projects we assembled the transcriptome of a clonal population of adult aposymbiotic dinoflagelate free aiptasia pallida from 208 million reads yielding 58018 contigs we demonstrated that many of these contigs represent full length or near full length transcripts that encode proteins similar to those from a diverse array of pathways in other organisms including various metabolic enzymes cytoskeletal proteins and neuropeptide precursors adult aposymbiotic aiptasia transcriptome version 1.1 the contigs were annotated by sequence similarity assigned go terms and scanned for conserved protein domains you can download a tab delimited annotations file here adult aposymbiotic aiptasia transcriptome version 1.1 annotations many alternatively spliced transcript were present in out transcriptome for the purposes of rna seq experiments transcripts with highly redundant sequence should be removed below is a fasta file of containing the longest transcript from each cluster adult aposymbiotic aiptasia transcriptome for mapping version 1.1
