protege plug in debugging tips home overview documentation downloads support community wiki about us users developers plug in debugging tips the plugins subdirectory of the protege installation directory is on the classpath when protege starts up and thus classes in the plugins your plugin subdirectory can be loaded one easy way to test and debug plug ins is to configure your development environment so that your class files are produced directly into this directory plugins your plugin they will then be seen the next time protege runs if you wish to place and use break points within your code you will want to declare a main method in your plug in that calls the protege application main method and configure your development environment to run your plug in class as the main application eg public class mytabplugin extends abstracttabwidget public static void main string args edu stanford smi protege application main args when a plug in is packaged as a jar file the system can find and use the plug in because it reads the manifest contained in the jar when you are developing your plug in and compiling into the plugins your plugin directory you will need to edit the file plugins your plugin meta inf manifest mf to provide the information the system needs to use your plug in this file can contain information about all plug ins which you are developing that is which exist as class files in the plugins your plugin directory when you have completed debugging your plug in and want to build a jar file you can then use this manifest as the manifest for your jar please note having the same or different versions of the same set of classes both as class files in the plugins your plugin directory and as entries in a jar file is very bad this situation will produce many strange errors which will be difficult to understand once you produce a jar file and put it in the plugins your plugin directory be sure to delete the corresponding class files and change the manifest file in the plugins your plugin meta inf directory to remove any references to the plug ins in the jar file home overview documentation downloads support community wiki about us protege is a national resource for biomedical ontologies and knowledge bases supported by the national library of medicine protege is a core component of the national center for biomedical ontology copyright 2012 stanford center for biomedical informatics research valid xhtml 1.0 valid css
