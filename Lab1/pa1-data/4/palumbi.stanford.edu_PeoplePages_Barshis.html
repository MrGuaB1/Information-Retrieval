daniel barshis daniel barshis barshis at stanford edu postdoctoral scholar my approach is to investigate species that naturally occur at the edges of their physiological tolerance limits in order to understand the molecular mechanisms that allow some organisms to survive while others cannot by understanding how organisms have naturally evolved to tolerate environmental variability we can then begin to predict how populations may respond to the accelerated rates of global climate change specifically my research focuses on the physiological responses of a population of back reef corals in american samoa that routinely survive temperatures thought to cause bleaching and mortality in most other areas if we can understand how this particular group of corals are able to survive these extreme exposures then we can start to identify other populations of corals that may be best adapted to survive future stresses caused by climate change back to people back to main page see the microdocs related to my research a natural global warming lab coral & ubiquitin tough
