escape to pokagon escape to pokagon an adventure game assignment the approach i use when assigning an adventure game is to encourage students to write an adventure engine which has the basic commands implemented but the storyline is read in from data files in this way one can write the program one time then just create a new set of data files for each new adventure game the best response to an adventure game assignment was escape to pokagon where students are asked to write an adventure simulation for the exploration of the park a key component of the assignment is the use of extra credit students are only required to implement a base set of features additional features which usually require additional learning and effort are worth additional points a majority of the students will pursue some form of extra credit and sometimes they can surprise you with their effort and creativity it is strongly recommended that students approach this program in stages first to just be able to read in and parse the data file then a simple adventure engine that supports movement only and finally the full working version which allows for the manipulation of objects scoring and so forth resources to make this assignment easy to adopt a variety of resources are at your disposal copies of the assignment handouts are available in both word and pdf format in addition source code for the assignment is available pokagon assignment ms word 506 kb adobe pdf 437 kb extra credit handout ms word 22 kb adobe pdf 65 kb sample data files room data file item data file adventure engine code note header files and documentation are freely available access to source code is restricted full working version movement only room data file parser only pokagon state park sites park web page park map potawatomi inn follow the twisty link back to the nifty adventure assignment web page created 9 february 2002 by john k estell eccs department ohio northern university
