stanford ppl stanford ppl homepage people members publications projects news contact login the stanford pervasive parallelism lab is a collaboration of many leading stanford computer scientists and electrical engineers for the purpose of developing the parallel computing platform for the year 2020 new heterogeneous architectures continue to provide increases in achievable performance but programming these devices to reach maximum performance levels is not straightforward the goal of the ppl is to make heterogeneous parallelism accessible to average software developers through domain specific languages dsls allowing the domain expert to develop parallel software without becoming an expert in parallel programming our approach is to use a layered system based on dsls a common parallel compiler and runtime infrastructure and an underlying architecture that provides efficient mechanisms for communication synchronization and performance monitoring we are supported by a completely open industrial affiliates program the open nature of the lab allows other companies to join the effort and does not provide any member company with exclusive intellectual property rights to the research results domain specific languages liszt mesh based pde solvers optiml machine learning optiql data analytics green marl small world graphs r 2 statistics random t random variables dsl infrastructure delite a compiler and runtime infrastructure for building new performance oriented dsls gramps a runtime for efficient pipeline parallelism sequoia a compiler for programming the memory hierarchy heterogeneous hardware accelerating tm hardware acceleration of transactional memory on commodity systems chip generator a flexible parameterized virtual microprocessor which can be optimized for each set of applications ml architecture customized hardware for machine learning vantage scalable and efficient fine grain cache partitioning zcache decoupling ways and associativity copyright 2011 all rights reserved stanford university
