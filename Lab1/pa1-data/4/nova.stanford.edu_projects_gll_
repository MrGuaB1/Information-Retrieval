galileo radio propagation experiments radio propagation experiments in the galileo mission galileo at jupiter the galileo spacecraft shown in the image at the left was launched in 1989 and has been orbiting jupiter since december 7 1995 the primary phase of the galileo mission lasted 2 years and 11 orbits during which a probe entered jupiter's atmosphere and diverse instruments onboard the orbiter monitored the jovian system jupiter its satellites rings and magnetosphere the spacecraft remained in good health after successfully completing the primary mission and an extended mission is now underway nasa's jet propulsion laboratory is responsible for managing the mission and operating the spacecraft the primary and extended missions include a total of 25 radio occultation experiments at jupiter 8 io 6 europa 3 ganymede 4 and callisto 4 these experiments use a radio signal transmitted by the spacecraft and received on earth for remote sensing of the planet and satellite ionospheres the galileo radio propagation team is responsible for the collection reduction and analysis of data from these experiments team members include team leader ht howard and dp hinson of stanford university aj kliore and r woo of nasa's jet propulsion laboratory and fm flasar of nasa's goddard space flight center this world wide web site offers access to selected results the galileo radio occultations provide profiles of electron number density versus radius in the ionospheres of jupiter and its primary satellites results for the following bodies are currently available through this site jupiter io additional results will be posted as they become available a list of publications by the galileo radio propagation team may be found here last updated september 23 2003 david hinson joe twicken
