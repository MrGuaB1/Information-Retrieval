protege build instructions protege build instructions this documentation is targeted toward users who would like to compile the protege source code using an ant build file you can retrieve our source code in one of two ways a stable version of the source code is made available in zip file format on the downloads page of our web site each time we do a build after unzipping the source code you will find the ant build file build xml in the root directory bleeding edge versions of our source code can be downloaded from our subversion repository if you re new to subversion we offer detailed documentation on downloading from our repository elsewhere to get the source code from subversion and successfully use the ant build file you must issue the following command svn checkout http smi protege stanford edu repos protege protege core trunk your destination dir after checkout the ant build file build xml will be located in the root directory issuing the above command ensures that the proper directory structure will be created for running the ant build file system requirements before building protege you must have the following software installed on your system the java development kit version 1.5 or higher make sure to set the java_home environment variable to the installation directory of your jdk the apache ant java based build tool see apache's web site to download ant the download includes installation instructions for all platforms the ant build script we distribute was developed with ant version 1.5 1 it should work on higher versions of ant but has not been tested on previous versions the java compiler compiler aka javacc or the java parser generator javacc is available for download through java net source package structure pertinent files in protege's source package build xml ant build file local properties template properties file contaning variables used by the ant build file readme html build instructions bin parser jj grammar file used by javacc during the compile process lib directory containing third party libraries needed to compile the protege source code src directory containing the protege source code initiating a build steps for initiating a build from the command line change into the installation directory where the protege source code was unzipped rename local properties template to local properties we added the template extension so that each time the source code is downloaded the local properties file is not overwritten which causes user defined settings to be lost open local properties and set the javacc home variable to the location of your javacc installation directory to start the build process type ant all when the build is finished there are several resulting items classes directory containing compiled protege source files dist directory containing the newly generated protege jar file as well as source and binary distributions of protege packaged in zip format docs apidocs directory containing the newly generated protege api documentation javadoc it's also possible to run various parts of the build separately for a list of available targets type ant on the command line
