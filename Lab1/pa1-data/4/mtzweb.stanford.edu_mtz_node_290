qtpie charge transfer with polarization current equalization a fluctuating charge model with correct asymptotics mtzweb stanford edu skip to main content home login home news people research publications software navigation research people publications publication type journal article authors chen jiahao martinez todd j source chemical physics letters volume 438 number 4 6 p 315 320 2007 abstract polarization and charge transfer are important effects which are difficult to describe using conventional force fields charge equilibration models can include both of these effects in large scale molecular simulations however these models behave incorrectly when bonds are broken making it difficult to use them in the context of reactive force fields we develop a new method for describing charge flow in molecules qtpie the qtpie method is based on charge transfer variables as opposed to atomic charges and correctly treats asymptotic behavior near dissociation it is also able to provide a realistic description of in plane polarizabilities log in to post comments google scholar
