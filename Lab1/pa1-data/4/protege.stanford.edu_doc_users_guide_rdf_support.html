rdf s support rdf schema support in protege 2000 for version 1.5 of protege 2000 we have re implemented our rdf schema support in order to make it more stable and to make it easier to implement other rdfs based backends such as oil and daml furthermore several features were added such as in addition to a round trip version you can export as simple rdf s ie protege specific facets are not encoded in additional triples support for namespace abbreviations frame names are never prefixed with complete uris only with abbreviations when exporting a project that has included projects you can put the included projects into different namespaces see the section renaming the default namespaces of included projects below here you will find a comparison of the rdf s and protege 2000 models importing creating and saving rdf s files to import your existing rdf s files into protege 2000 select the project import menu item and select rdf schema from the storage format dialog enter the name of the file containing your rdf schema and the name of the file containing your rdf instance data in the appropriate fields to create a new rdf project which will include the schema and the instance data select the project new menu item and select rdf schema from the storage format dialog an existing protege 2000 project can be saved as an rdf s project by selecting the project save in format menu item and selecting rdf schema from the storage format dialog if you check plain rdfs no protege specific facets are exported you can use project save in format to export a project using the old backend into a project using the new one don t use project import for this since the new backend uses different encodings for protege specific facets renaming the default namespaces of included projects this feature can be used to transform an existing standard text file clips project into an rdf s one where frames from included projects reside in different namespaces you can also achieve the reverse effect ie forcing all or some projects to share a namespace or have the same namespace as the main project here is how it works transform the project into an rdf s one where all projects main and included ones have the same default namespace you need to do this bottom up ie for the included projects first and finally for the main one make sure you save all files with new file names or in a new directory or the main file does not load any more since it will already try to load the new included projects load the new main project and click project save as if you have included projects that were loaded with the rdf s backend you will see an advanced button change some or all of the namespaces and save the console window will show a remark if namespaces of included projects are renamed close the project for each of the included projects for which you have renamed the default namespace load and change the namespace via project save as you can now load the main project example a simple example is in the protege 2000 examples rdf directory known bugs and problems only the rdf schema namespace http www w3 org tr 1999 pr rdf schema 19990303 is supported when saving on import the new namespace is also recognized rdfs seealso rdfs isdefinedby rdfs label container and reified statements are not supported multiple types for a single resource are not supported you cannot make changes to the standard meta classes ie rdf resource rdf property rdfs class etc xml schema data types are not recognized as rdfs literal but it is unclear if they should
