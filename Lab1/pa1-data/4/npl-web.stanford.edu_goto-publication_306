silver nanomesh as a cathode for solid oxide fuel cells ecs transactions 35 2209 2011 silver nanomesh as a cathode for solid oxide fuel cells ecs transactions 35 2209 2011 joon hyung shim young beom kim joong sun park fritz b prinz abstract we have tested a silver nano mesh with close packed holes as cathodic catalysts for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells the nano mesh structure was fabricated in a close packed hexagonal array with the pore size of 500 600nm fuel cell tests were conducted using the nano mesh silver cathodes with commercial 100m thick 8 yttria stabilized zirconia electrolytes and sputtered porous platinum anodes performance of the fuel cells was analyzed by the current voltage and the potentiostatic current measurements at temperatures of 250 300oc we confirmed that the nano mesh silver cathodes improved fuel cell performance dramatically and enhanced stability against thermal degradation and morphological agglomeration compared to randomly sputtered porous silver cathodes
