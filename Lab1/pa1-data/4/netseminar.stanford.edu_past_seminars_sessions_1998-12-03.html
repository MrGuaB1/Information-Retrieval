abstract biography stanford networking seminar 12 15pm thursday december 3 1998 room 104 gates computer science building on traffic types and priority functions in switched lan networks mansour karam mans leland stanford edu & fouad tobagi tobagi ee stanford edu about the talk with the growth of the internet witnessed in the recent years new types of applications must be supported by the network depending on their requirements they can be divided into two different categories real time applications voice video which require delivery of traffic within stringent time constraints 10ms for voice 100ms for video and important business applications for which the response time of the network should be unaffected by external factors eg loading traffic generated by applications belonging to each category vary widely in their characteristics transmission rates and burstiness and must coexist on the same network with each other and with traditional best effort traffic which is known to be highly bursty self similar recent work conducted by the internet engineering task force ietf specifies different types of service to be provided by the internet in parallel the lan bridging ieee 802.1 d standard has added the provision of expedited traffic capabilities in this process traffic types are mapped to the different available levels of priority in this study we illustrate the benefit of these priority functions in the context of ethernet lans conforming to the ieee 802.1 d protocol in this respect we start by characterizing each of the traffic types of interest then investigate the effects of their intermixing the benefit provided by their separation into different traffic classes and the parameters on which this benefit depends this work will be useful in tailoring the design of a network to the intended use and in admission control about the speaker
