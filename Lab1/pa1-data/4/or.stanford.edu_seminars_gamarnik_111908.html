queueing systems in the halfin whitt heavy traffic regime queueing systems in the halfin whitt heavy traffic regime david gamarnik sloan school of management mit wednesday november 19 2008 4 30 5 45 pm terman engineering center room 453 abstract a parallel server queueing system in the so called halfin whitt quality and efficiency driven heavy traffic regime has been actively studied recently as a model of large scale call centers very little is known about the behavior of this system for generally non exponentially distributed service times call durations we will discuss the behavior of this system in the steady state when the service times havelattice valued distribution we characterize the limiting queue length and waiting time distributions in terms of the stationary distribution of some explicitly constructed markov chain as a consequence the correct scaling behavior of this system is established then we obtain an explicit expression for the decay rate of the queue length and waiting time distribution which has a very simple representation in terms of three parameters the amount of spare capacity and the coefficients of variation of interarrival and service times no background on queueing theory is expected and some connections with an ongoing project on management of cisco workgroups will be discussed joint work with petar momcilovic university of michigan operations research colloquia http or stanford edu oras_seminars html
