synthesis of microscale lead sulfide disks by patterned self assembled monolayer ecs transactions 25 3 2009 synthesis of microscale lead sulfide disks by patterned self assembled monolayer ecs transactions 25 3 2009 takane usui neil p dasgupta xirong jiang wonyoung lee fritz b prinz abstract this work explores an approach to utilize nanosphere lithography nsl and atomic layer deposition ald to fabricate an array of microscale disks of lead sulfide pbs in this approach a mold to fabricate polymer stamps was produced by nsl using these stamps a patterned self assembled monolayer sam of octadecyltrichlorosilane odts was deposited using microcontact printing the odts sam functioned as a resist to block the growth of ald pbs the resulting pbs disks were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem and auger electron spectroscopy aes to confirm the morphology and stoichiometry regular arrays of microscale pbs disks were successfully fabricated this is a potentially attractive methodology for fabrication of multi layer devices
