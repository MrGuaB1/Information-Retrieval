probcons probabilistic consistency based multiple alignment of amino acid sequences probabilistic consistency based multiple alignment of amino acid sequences run about download help about the probcons project probcons is a novel tool for generating multiple alignments of protein sequences using a combination of probabilistic modeling and consistency based alignment techniques probcons has achieved the highest accuracies of all alignment methods to date on the balibase benchmark alignment database alignments produced by probcons show statistically significant improvement over current programs containing an average of 7 more correctly aligned columns than those of t coffee 11 more correctly aligned columns than those of clustal w and 14 more correctly aligned columns than those of dialign probcons was developed by chuong do in collaboration with michael brudno in the research group of serafim batzoglou department of computer science stanford university further information the methods used in probcons are described in the following paper do cb mahabhashyam msp brudno m and batzoglou s 2005 probcons probabilistic consistency based multiple sequence alignment genome research 15 330 340
