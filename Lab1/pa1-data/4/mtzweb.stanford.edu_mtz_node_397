excited state dynamics mtzweb stanford edu skip to main content home login home news people research publications software navigation research people publications our research bridges the gap between traditional molecular dynamics what are the atoms doing and quantum chemistry what are the electrons doing we are especially interested in electronic excited states where both of these questions must be answered before a cohesive picture of chemistry can emerge we have developed the unique capability to perform first principles simulations of photochemistry simultaneously solving both the nuclear and electronic schrodinger equations we are developing new models of electronic structure theory which will improve our understanding of molecular interactions involving electronically excited states we are currently investigating light harvesting molecules uv damage in dna light induced isomerization and the mechanism of proteins involved in vision
