dynel example 4 present day state of stress the example shows how we can study the present day stress the model fig 1 has a density of 2000 kg m 3 a young's modulus of 30 gpa and a poisson's ratio of 0.25 the computed vertical stress component s zz is shown on figure 2a and figure 2b within the voulme and along the well respectivelly figure 1 model configuration showing the surface topography and the tunnel the model has been tetrahedrized figure 2 a computed vertical stress component s zz b plot of s zz along the vertical well see how the stress is perturbed close of the tunnel copyright the stanford rock fracture project 2002
