the stanford nlp natural language processing group the stanford natural language processing group home people teaching research publications software events local members of the stanford nlp group pursue research in a broad variety of topics computational semantics extraction of meaning representations from text ranging from shallow representations like named entities and thematic roles to deep structures like quantification in logic and rich event structures research topics include coreference resolution natural logic and inference narratives and event representations detecting contradictions in text semantic taxonomy induction named entity recognition ner and information extraction ie nlp applied to social meaning and the social sciences we are interested in using natural language processing to understand large scale social phenomena including intellectual history the spread of ideas and innovations and the nature of citation networks as well as topics in the extraction of social meaning from text and speech mimir project what drives the dynamics of science extraction of sentiment and social meaning from text and speech deep learning in natural language processing algorithms that tackle various problems in natural language processing such as parsing sentiment analysis or paraphrase detection the methods that we explore are general in nature and can also be applied to vision problems deep learning in natural language processing parsing & tagging algorithms for assigning part of speech and syntactic structure emphasizing probabilistic and discriminative models research topics include probabilistic parsing machine translation language modeling re ordering models phrase extraction techniques syntactic methods and better training for statistical machine translation machine translation dialog and speech processing research in dialog modeling and speech processing dialog modeling speech recognition and synthesis unsupervised and semisupervised learning of linguistic structure probabilistic and other corpus based algorithms for learning linguistic structures from corpora research topics include grammar induction morphology & phonology induction semantic taxonomy induction inducing narratives and event representations multilingual nlp a variety of nlp investigations in chinese arabic and german including tagging segmentation probabilistic syntactic parsing and semantic role parsing as well as work on speech processing research topics include chinese nlp and speech arabic nlp german nlp past work a number of projects have been worked on by members of the nlp group but are no longer being actively developed these include personalized pagerank algorithms computational lexicography kirrkirr text categorization the stanford edinburgh entity recognition seer project the edinburgh and stanford information extraction easie project shallow semantic parsing question answering qa knowledge representation from text the nlkr project solving natural language logic puzzles word sense disambiguation wsd part of speech pos tagging links computational linguistics stanford other groups at stanford doing nlp related research the computational semantics lab at csli the lingo lkb project at csli the stanford speech processing group martin kay other links statistical nlp resources linguistics resources local links nlp lunch pail lunch nlp reading group javanlp javadocs machines wiki calendar site design by bill maccartney
