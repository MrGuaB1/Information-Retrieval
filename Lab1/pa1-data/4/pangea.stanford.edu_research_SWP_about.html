swplab about us swplab group the stanford wave physics laboratory was created in 2003 to foster development of geophysical methods for high resolution characterization of earth's subsurface from its roots as the seismic tomography project stp today's swplab incorporates on a variety of research activities ranging from experimental laboratory and field methods data processing and inversion to computational techniques results of these activities are being applied to near surface characterization problems oil and gas exploration carbon sequestration and rock and material characterization studies most of the research in the group builds on a foundation of the physics of wave phenomena active projects include research on seismic attenuation tomography acoustical spectroscopy true 4 d time lapse imaging and large scale numerical simulation of seismic waves in multi scale media to date the primary focus has been seismic waves but future interests include electromagnetic and coupled wave phenomena directed by prof jerry m harris swplab has active collaboration and projects with private industry and government laboratories prof harris is also the director of the stanford center for computational earth and environmental science
