the optimal weight g next up previous contents index next term frequency and weighting up parametric and zone indexes previous learning weights contents index the optimal weight g we begin by noting that for any training example for which and the score computed by equation 14 is in similar fashion we may write down the score computed by equation 14 for the three other possible combinations of and this is summarized in figure 6.6 figure 6.6 the four possible combinations of and let respectively denote the number of training examples for which and and the editorial judgment is relevant respectively non relevant then the contribution to the total error in equation 17 from training examples for which and is 18 by writing in similar fashion the error contributions from training examples of the other three combinations of values for and and extending the notation in the obvious manner the total error corresponding to equation 17 is 19 by differentiating equation 19 with respect to and setting the result to zero it follows that the optimal value of is 20 exercises when using weighted zone scoring is it necessary for all zones to use the same boolean match function in example 6.1 1 above with weights and what are all the distinct score values a document may get rewrite the algorithm in figure 6.4 to the case of more than two query terms write pseudocode for the function weightedzone for the case of two postings lists in figure 6.4 apply equation 20 to the sample training set in figure 6.5 to estimate the best value of for this sample for the value of estimated in exercise 6.1 3 compute the weighted zone score for each query document example how do these scores relate to the relevance judgments in figure 6.5 quantized to 0 1 why does the expression for in 20 not involve training examples in which and have the same value next up previous contents index next term frequency and weighting up parametric and zone indexes previous learning weights contents index 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
