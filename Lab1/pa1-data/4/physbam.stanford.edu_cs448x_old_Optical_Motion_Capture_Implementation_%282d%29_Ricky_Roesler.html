optical motion capture implementation ricky roesler optical motion capture implementation ricky roesler optical motion capture final project can be found here project goals this project will focus on the computer vision aspects of motion capture systems in particular i plan to implement a very basic motion capture system that can be run from my home computer background i have worked with computer vision applications previously last quarter i was involved with a project that estimated scene depth using video from a cell phone camera this type of knowledge will be required to calculate 3d position of makers i have also worked a fair amount with opencv and matlab two tools that are likely to come in handy for this project if you are interested in working on this project please email me at rroesler stanford edu topics that will be covered why use optical motion capture compare with true animation and live action optical mocap vs other types of mocap required hardware cameras visible & infrared calibration issues lights visible & infrared markers passive & active studio setup number of cameras etc identifying markers finding markers in a video frame correlating markers between frames tracking markers probabilistically finding a marker's location bayesian filtering 3d triangulation smoothing issues turning marker locations into usable data true location vs bone rotation animation using mocap mocap in industry & academia landmark movies in the history of mocap current mocap research 2011 03 29 17 43
