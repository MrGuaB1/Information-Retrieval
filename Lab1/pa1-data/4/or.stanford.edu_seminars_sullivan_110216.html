dippy a simplified interface for advanced mixed integer programming dippy a simplified interface for advanced mixed integer programming mike o sullivan dept of engineering science auckland university new zealand wednesday feb 16 2011 4 30 5 30 pm y2e2 101 abstract the development of mathematical modeling languages such as ampl gams xpress mp and opl studio have made it easier to formulate mathematical models such as linear mixed integer and nonlinear programs for solution in solvers such as cplex gurobi and snopt however some models cannot be solved using black box solvers so advanced techniques need to be added to the solver framework many solvers including cplex symphony and dip provide callback functions to enable users to customize the overall solution framework however this approach involves either expressing the mathematical formulation in a low level language such as c++ or java or implementing a complicated indexing scheme to track formulation components such as variables and constraints between the modeling language and the solver's callback framework in this talk i will present dippy a combination of the python mathematical modeling language pulp and the open source solver dip using dippy users can express their model in a straightforward modeling language and use callback functions to access the pulp model directly we discuss the link between pulp and dip and give examples of advanced solving techniques expressed simply in dippy operations research colloquia http or stanford edu oras_seminars html
