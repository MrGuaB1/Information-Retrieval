the underlying theory next up previous contents index next the rocchio71 algorithm up the rocchio algorithm for previous the rocchio algorithm for contents index the underlying theory we want to find a query vector denoted as that maximizes similarity with relevant documents while minimizing similarity with nonrelevant documents if is the set of relevant documents and is the set of nonrelevant documents then we wish to find 47 where is defined as in equation 24 under cosine similarity the optimal query vector for separating the relevant and nonrelevant documents is 48 that is the optimal query is the vector difference between the centroids of the relevant and nonrelevant documents see figure 9.3 however this observation is not terribly useful precisely because the full set of relevant documents is not known it is what we want to find 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
