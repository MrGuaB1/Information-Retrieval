anchor text and the web graph next up previous contents index next pagerank up the web as a previous the web as a contents index anchor text and the web graph the following fragment of html code from a web page shows a hyperlink pointing to the home page of the journal of the acm a href http www acm org jacm journal of the acm a in this case the link points to the page http www acm org jacm and the anchor text is journal of the acm clearly in this example the anchor is descriptive of the target page but then the target page b http www acm org jacm itself contains the same description as well as considerable additional information on the journal so what use is the anchor text the web is full of instances where the page b does not provide an accurate description of itself in many cases this is a matter of how the publishers of page b choose to present themselves this is especially common with corporate web pages where a web presence is a marketing statement for example at the time of the writing of this book the home page of the ibm corporation http www ibm com did not contain the term computer anywhere in its html code despite the fact that ibm is widely viewed as the world's largest computer maker similarly the html code for the home page of yahoo http www yahoo com does not at this time contain the word portal thus there is often a gap between the terms in a web page and how web users would describe that web page consequently web searchers need not use the terms in a page to query for it in addition many web pages are rich in graphics and images and or embed their text in these images in such cases the html parsing performed when crawling will not extract text that is useful for indexing these pages the standard ir approach to this would be to use the methods outlined in chapter 9 and section 12.4 the insight behind anchor text is that such methods can be supplanted by anchor text thereby tapping the power of the community of web page authors the fact that the anchors of many hyperlinks pointing to http www ibm com include the word computer can be exploited by web search engines for instance the anchor text terms can be included as terms under which to index the target web page thus the postings for the term computer would include the document http www ibm com and that for the term portal would include the document http www yahoo com using a special indicator to show that these terms occur as anchor rather than in page text as with in page terms anchor text terms are generally weighted based on frequency with a penalty for terms that occur very often the most common terms in anchor text across the web are click and here using methods very similar to idf the actual weighting of terms is determined by machine learned scoring as in section 15.4 1 current web search engines appear to assign a substantial weighting to anchor text terms the use of anchor text has some interesting side effects searching for big blue on most web search engines returns the home page of the ibm corporation as the top hit this is consistent with the popular nickname that many people use to refer to ibm on the other hand there have been and continue to be many instances where derogatory anchor text such as evil empire leads to somewhat unexpected results on querying for these terms on web search engines this phenomenon has been exploited in orchestrated campaigns against specific sites such orchestrated anchor text may be a form of spamming since a website can create misleading anchor text pointing to itself to boost its ranking on selected query terms detecting and combating such systematic abuse of anchor text is another form of spam detection that web search engines perform the window of text surrounding anchor text sometimes referred to as extended anchor text is often usable in the same manner as anchor text itself consider for instance the fragment of web text there is good discussion of vedic scripture a here a this has been considered in a number of settings and the useful width of this window has been studied see section 21.4 for references exercises is it always possible to follow directed edges hyperlinks in the web graph from any node web page to any other why or why not find an instance of misleading anchor text on the web given the collection of anchor text phrases for a web page suggest a heuristic for choosing one term or phrase from this collection that is most descriptive of does your heuristic in the previous exercise take into account a single domain repeating anchor text for from multiple pages in next up previous contents index next pagerank up the web as a previous the web as a contents index 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
