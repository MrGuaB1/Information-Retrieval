stanford networking seminar 12 15pm thursday april 8 2010 gates 104 scalable enterprise networks with inexpensive switches minlan yu princeton university about the talk enterprise networks are growing larger and ever more difficult to manage several emerging techniques help improve network management flat addressing to support host mobility shortest path routing to improve performance and flow based switches to enable fine grain policies however these techniques introduce scalability challenges in enterprises with many hosts switches and flow rules forcing the use of expensive switches with large power hungry memory for processing data packets in our work we improve the scalability of enterprise networks through a combination of new data structures that make effective use of limited memory and traffic indirection that minimizes state required at each switch we first present buffalo which uses bloom filters to reduce memory usage in switch forwarding tables then we present difane a distributed architecture for managing the flow rules that enforce fine grain policies for access control routing and traffic measurement both buffalo and difane can be easily implemented with small modifications in today's switches as demonstrated by our prototypes built using the click modular router about the speaker minlan yu is a 4th year ph d student working with jennifer rexford in the computer science department at princeton university she received her ba in computer science and mathematics from peking university in 2006 and her ma in computer science from princeton university in 2008 her research interest is in network virtualization enterprise and data center networks
