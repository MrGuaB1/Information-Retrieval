protege owl jena integration home overview documentation downloads support community wiki about us users developers see also protege owl faq integration of jena in protege owl jena is one of the most widely used java apis for rdf and owl providing services for model representation parsing database persistence querying and some visualization tools protege owl has always had a close relationship with jena the jena arp parser is still used in the protege owl parser and various other services such as species validation and datatype handling have been reused from jena it was furthermore possible to convert a protege owlmodel into a jena ontmodel to get a static snapshot of the model at run time this model however had to be rebuilt after each change in the model as of august 2005 protege owl is now much more closely integrated with jena this integration allows programmers to user certain jena functions at run time without having to go through the slow rebuild process each time the architecture of this integration is illustrated below the key to this integration is the fact that both systems operate on a low level triple representation of the model protege has its native frame store mechanism which has been wrapped in protege owl with the triplestore classes in the jena world the corresponding interfaces are called graph and model the protege triplestore has been wrapped into a jena graph so that any read access from the jena api in fact operates on the protege triples in order to modify these triples the conventional protege owl api must be used however this mechanism allows the use of jena methods for querying while the ontology is edited inside protege the owlmodel api has a new method getjenamodel to access a jena view of the protege model at run time this can be used by protege plug in developers many other jena services can be wrapped into protege plug ins this way by providing them a pointer to the model created by protege home overview documentation downloads support community wiki about us protege is a national resource for biomedical ontologies and knowledge bases supported by the national library of medicine protege is a core component of the national center for biomedical ontology copyright 2012 stanford center for biomedical informatics research valid xhtml 1.0 valid css
