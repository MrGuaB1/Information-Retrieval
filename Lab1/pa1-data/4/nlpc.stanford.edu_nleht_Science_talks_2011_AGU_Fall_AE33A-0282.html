ae33a 0282 effects of earth's curvature in full wave modeling of vlf propagation linhai qiu nikolai g lehtinen umran s inan electrical engineering stanford university stanford ca usa we show how to include curvature in the full wave finite element approach to calculate elf vlf wave propagation in horizontally stratified earth ionosphere waveguide a general curvilinear stratified system is considered and the numerical solutions of full wave method in curvilinear system are compared with the analytic solutions in the cylindrical and spherical waveguides filled with an isotropic medium we calculate the attenuation and height gain for modes in the earth ionosphere waveguide taking into account the anisotropicity of ionospheric plasma for different assumptions about the earth's curvature and quantify the corrections due to the curvature the results are compared with the results of previous models such as lwpc as well as with ground and satellite observations and show improved accuracy compared with full wave method without including the curvature effect
