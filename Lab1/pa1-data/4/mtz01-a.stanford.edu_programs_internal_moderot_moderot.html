moderot moderot this program takes as input 2 molden files of the same molecule at different geometries one molecule is rotated to best fit the geometry of the other and the normal modes are rotated appropriately finally the projection of the modes of one of the molecules onto the other is computed and output usage moderot e input files molden1 in molden format file with geometry and normal mode analysis at target geometry molden2 in molden format file with geometry and normal mode analysis at reference geometry input molden files must contain the following sections atoms freq fr coord fr norm coord output files molden1 out molden format file with target geometry rotated to best fit reference geometry normal modes are also rotated accordingly projection out projection matrix ie duschinsky rotation matrix example molden1 in target geometry and normal modes molden2 in reference geometry and normal modes molden1 out output file with target geometry rotated to best fit reference geometry projection out output file with mode rotation matrix
