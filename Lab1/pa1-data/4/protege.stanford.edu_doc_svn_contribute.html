protege contributor's guide protege contributor's guide this documentation is targeted toward protege contributors a protege contributor is an individual contributing one or more plug ins that are bundled with the protege installation it may also be of interest to users who wish to dowload bleeding edge versions of the protege source code due to overwhelming demand from our user community in february of 2005 we migrated the source code for core protege protege frames and many of the protege plug ins to an internet accessible version control system called subversion browsing protege source code getting protege source code protege repository structure committing code to the repository browsing protege source code if you are just interested in browsing the source code and or downloading individual files the best way to do this is through viewvc formerly known as viewcvs viewvc is a web based version control repository browser for both cvs and subversion repositories getting protege source code everyone has been granted read access to the protege subverison repository if you would like to get the most recent version of our code you need a subversion client the subversion book has a list of known clients here at stanford we have either been using the command line tool tortoisesvn or subclipse to follow are examples of checking out the protege core module using the command line tool and tortoisesvn these examples can be applied to checking out any other module such as owl standard extensions prompt etc from the command line svn checkout http smi protege stanford edu repos protege protege core trunk your destination dir from tortoisesvn tortoisesvn is integrated into windows explorer once you have created a destination folder for the protege core module right click and select checkout in the checkout dialog fill out the repository url and the name of your destination directory please note if you checkout the latest version of our source code we don t guarantee that it will be in a stable working state if you need a stable version of the code please download the zip file that we post to our downloads page each time we do an official build protege repository structure the protege repository contains top level directories for each protege plug in and the core application protege core under each top level directory are three subdirectories called branches tags and trunk trunk is where main project development occurs branches contains branched versions of the main development line and tags is for snapshots of the main development line that may be created and destroyed as needed this is the recommended layout in the subversion book to read more about why they recommend this layout please refer to the section in chapter five entitled choosing a repository layout committing code to the repository each developer that contributes bundled plug in s has a top level directory in the repository for your plug in s a bundled plug in is a plug in that is written and maintained outside of stanford but is included in the protege installation for the convenience of our end users we are using apache's basic http authentication scheme to verify that you are who you say you are when you try to commit code to the repository you will be asked for your username and password when you commit to the repository usernames and passwords are assigned to you by the protege team we don t have the capability at this time to allow contributors to log in to our server and choose your username and password we also enforce per directory level permissions on the repository so you will only be able to check code into the directory where your plug in resides how do i know where to commit the latest version of my contribution underneath the trunk directory is a directory with a name that corresponds to the directory name into which your plug in is installed for example jambalaya branches tags trunk ca uvic cs chisel jambalaya each time we do a build our automatic build process will grab the contents of this directory do not put anything in this directory other than the files needed to install your plug in for example algernon branches tags trunk org algernon about_algernon html algernon jar plugin properties doc index html what if i want to change the name of the directory where my plug in is installed you must notify us if you change the name of the directory into which your plug in is installed our automatic build scripts were written to use the names that currently exist in the repository if you change the directory name our build process will break is it possible to put the source code for my plug in in your repository absolutely for an example of a contributor that is already doing this please see the protege script console plug in what should i do if i have a question or a problem send email to the repository administrators please be as specific as possible
