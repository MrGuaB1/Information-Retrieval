pig hold at 20 turn outcomes estimation hold at 20 outcomes estimation pig is a folk jeopardy dice game with simple rules two players race to reach 100 points each turn a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 pig is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls ie the turn total at any time during a player's turn the player is faced with two decisions roll if the player rolls a 1 the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn 2 6 the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues hold the turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn problem simulate a given number of hold at 20 turns and report the estimated probabilities of the possible scoring outcomes input format enter a single positive integer indicating the number of turns simulated larger numbers will tend to yield better estimations output format initially prompt the user with hold at 20 turn simulations on the next line print score and estimated probability separated by a tab after the simulations print a table line for each score outcome that occurred in increasing order of score for each score outcome print the score a tab and the fraction of turn simulations that yielded that score sample transcript input underlined hold at 20 turn simulations 1000000 score estimated probability 0 0.624076 20 0.099659 21 0.095310 22 0.074086 23 0.054599 24 0.035313 25 0.016957 extra exercises what is the expected average score outcome for hold at 20 additionally allow the user to specify the hold value what is the probability of reaching 100 in a single turn todd neller
