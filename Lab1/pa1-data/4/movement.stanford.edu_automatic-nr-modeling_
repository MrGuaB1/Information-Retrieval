automatic non rigid 3d modeling from video automatic non rigid 3d modeling from video lorenzo torresani aaron hertzmann abstract we present a robust framework for estimating non rigid 3d shape and motion in video sequences given an input video sequence and a user specified region to reconstruct the algorithm automatically solves for the 3d time varying shape and motion of the object and estimates which pixels are outliers while learning all system parameters including a pdf over non rigid deformations there are no user tuned parameters other than initialization all parameters are learned by maximizing the likelihood of the entire image stream we apply our method to both rigid and non rigid shape reconstruction and demonstrate it in challenging cases of occlusion and variable illumination paper automatic non rigid 3d modeling from video lorenzo torresani and aaron hertzmann t o appear eccv 2004 pdf errata see also our work on non rigid structure from motion presented at nips 2003 results tracking and 3d reconstruction of non rigid human motion features were selected automatically in the first frame points are colored according to their estimated outlier probability green for completely valid pixels red for outliers and occluded points our robust tracking method applied to a sequence of mostly rigid face head motion points from the left side of the subject's face are occluded for more than 50 of the sequence tracking and 3d reconstruction from a bullfight sequence taken from the movie talk to her additional results back to the movement group page
