darwin's world darwin's world darwin sworld is one of my all time favorite assignments it's too big for a one week assignment but it builds something fun to play with and it emphasizes useful issues its features include it's fun and visual it builds something that the students enjoy playing around with it's a medium hard cs2 project big enough to have some real decomp as a hidden agenda it shows the students how simple an interpreter can be and it foreshadows the halting problem in my talk at sig cse i think everyone got the simulator aspect of the program the creatures run around and do stuff to each other however the questions i got afterwards made it clear that i did not do a good job of emphasizing the more interesting interpreter aspect of the creatures each species is defined by its textual species program which can be programmed independently of darwin's world imho the interpreter is the most valuable part of the assignment anyway please check it out the original assignment handout dawin92 pdf written in pascal the modern eric roberts version using his portable c libraries darwin99 pdf a directory of creature programs cheers nick parlante
