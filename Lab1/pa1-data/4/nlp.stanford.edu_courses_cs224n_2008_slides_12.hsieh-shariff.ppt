classifying reading levels with statistical language models classifying reading levels with statistical language models johnson hsieh sameer shariff problem given a passage of english text can we classify the text at the appropriate reading level dataset english novels from various reading lists 5 th 7 th grade 15 books tom sawyer black beauty etc 8 th 10 th grade 16 books a tale of two cities the call of the wild etc 11 th 12 th grade 17 books pride and prejudice the awakening etc approach build language models for each class classify new text based on model that was most likely to generate this text generative model model 1 classify text based purely on these language models with some interesting smoothing techniques model 2 build a discriminative multinomial logistic regression model that uses these language models as just one of many features data separability a hard problem language model results accuracy of books predicted correctly total of books weighted accuracy predicted correctly 0.5 off by one total of books without language model with language model multinomial logistic regression results conclusions and future work statistical language models do capture information that can help differentiate between different reading levels better than traditional measures such as flesch kinkaid multinomial logistic regression models with additional features outperform the pure language model approach though using the language model as a feature greatly improves performance future work explore higher order language models investigate language model overfitting
