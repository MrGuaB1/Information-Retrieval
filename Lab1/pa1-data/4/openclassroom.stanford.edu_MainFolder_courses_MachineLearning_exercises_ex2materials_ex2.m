exercise 2 linear regression data is roughly based on 2000 cdc growth figures for boys x refers to a boy's age y is a boy's height in meters clear all close all clc x load ex2x dat y load ex2y dat m length y number of training examples plot the training data figure open a new figure window plot x y o ylabel height in meters xlabel age in years gradient descent x ones m 1 x add a column of ones to x theta zeros size x 1 initialize fitting parameters max_itr 1500 alpha 0.07 for num_iterations 1 max_itr this is a vectorized version of the gradient descent update formula it's also fine to use the summation formula from the videos here is the gradient grad 1 m x x theta y here is the actual update theta theta alpha grad sequential update the wrong way to do gradient descent grad1 1 m x 1 x theta y theta 1 theta 1 alpha grad1 grad2 1 m x 2 x theta y theta 2 theta 2 alpha grad2 end print theta to screen theta plot the linear fit hold on keep previous plot visible plot x 2 x theta legend training data linear regression hold off don t overlay any more plots on this figure closed form solution for reference you will learn about this method in future videos exact_theta x x x y predict values for age 3.5 and 7 predict1 1 3.5 theta predict2 1 7 theta calculate j matrix grid over which we will calculate j theta0_vals linspace 3 3 100 theta1_vals linspace 1 1 100 initialize j_vals to a matrix of 0's j_vals zeros length theta0_vals length theta1_vals for i 1 length theta0_vals for j 1 length theta1_vals t theta0_vals i theta1_vals j j_vals i j 0.5 m x t y x t y end end because of the way meshgrids work in the surf command we need to transpose j_vals before calling surf or else the axes will be flipped j_vals j_vals surface plot figure surf theta0_vals theta1_vals j_vals xlabel theta_0 ylabel theta_1 contour plot figure plot j_vals as 15 contours spaced logarithmically between 0.01 and 100 contour theta0_vals theta1_vals j_vals logspace 2 2 15 xlabel theta_0 ylabel theta_1
