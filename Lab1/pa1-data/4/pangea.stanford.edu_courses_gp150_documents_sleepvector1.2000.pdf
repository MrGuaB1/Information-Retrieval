vector problem 150 1 page 1 geophysics 150 home set due nov 8 2000 1 the wheels on a wagon resolve forces into components parallel and pendicular to the wagon only the parallel component drives motion in the desired direction a horse and a mule are pulling on a wagon viewed from the top a resolve the horse and mule vectors into components parallel and pendendicular to the wagon wheels b find the net force driving the wagon forward c instead take the horse direction and its perpendicular crudely in the direction of the mule as a coordinate system find the components of the horse mule and wagon forward vectors in this coordinate system 1 horse mule 1000 nt 800 nt 25 45
