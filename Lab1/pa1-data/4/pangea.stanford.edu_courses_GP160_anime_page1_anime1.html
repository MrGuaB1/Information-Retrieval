ray vs wavefield modeling traveltime solutions vs wavefields gp 160 this page examines acoustic wavefield and traveltime modeling as applied to a couple of simple and one complex velocity models each row in the table below provides links to a model a traveltime map and a wavefield movie mpg in addition to generic information on the simulation both traveltimes and wavefields were calculated on the same 2d grids 100x100m and 800x800 grid points the traveltime maps were calculated using a finite difference eikonal solver which combines the evaluation order used in sethian's fast marching algorithm with the accurate 2nd order stencils used in vidale's original fd eikonal method acoustic wavefields were calculated using a 2nd order in space and time fd method assuming constant density very similar to a 2d version of the aco1dvvcd code supplied in the 1d wave toolbox model dimensions grid dimensions 800x800 samples real dimensions 100x100 m simulation test runs comparisons model eikonal solution movie acoustic model characteristics run parameters layer 1 1500 m s layer 2 4000 m s interface at 50 m source wavelet 400 hz ricker dx dz 0.125 m source location grid 150200 background 1500 m s diffractor 4000 m s source wavelet 400 hz ricker dx dz 0.125 m source location grid 250600 background 4000 m s block 1500 m s source wavelet 400 hz ricker dx dz 0.125 m source location grid 100400 jfrank pangea stanford edu
