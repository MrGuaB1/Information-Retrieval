seadas data processing programs help seadas data processing programs seadas includes a variety of data processing programs accessible via the seadas gui the seadas command line and the unix command line using the gui can be a good way to learn a processing program's functionality however using the seadas command line or unix command line is generally more efficient and can be used to automate data processing many seadas unix utility commands are also available to standardize program names as of seadas 5.2 many programs have been renamed these changes are summarized here and are also noted in the table below idl function unix binary or shell script description previous name shared by all sensors l2gen l2gen l1 to l2 processing msl12 l2extract l2extract l2 file extraction msl2extract l2bin l2bin l2 to l3 binning unchanged l3bin l3bin further binning of l3 binned files unchanged smigen smigen l3 standard mapped image smi generation unchanged modis l1agen_modis modis_l0_to_l1a_geo csh l0 to l1a geo processing modis_l1agen geogen_modis modis_l1a_to_geo csh l1a to geo processing geolocate l1aextract_modis modis_l1a_extract csh l1a file extraction modis_subscene l1bgen_modis modis_l1a_to_l1b csh l1a to l1b processing modis_l1bgen l1brsgen_modis l1brsgen l1 browse image generation msl1brsgen seawifs l1agen_seawifs l1agen_seawifs l0 to l1a processing l1agen l1aextract_seawifs l1aextract_seawifs l1a interactive file extraction extract l1bgen l1bgen l1a to l1b processing msl1bgen l1brsgen_seawifs l1brsgen l2brsgen l1 and l2 browse image generation msl1brsgen octs l1bgen l1bgen l1a gac to l1b processing msl1bgen czcs l1bgen l1bgen l1a to l1b processing msl1bgen &dagger the ms_met csh ms_ozone csh and ms_oisst csh unix shell scripts can be used to determine and retrieve optimal ancillary data for use with the l2gen unix binary the functionality of these three scripts is built into the l2gen idl function
