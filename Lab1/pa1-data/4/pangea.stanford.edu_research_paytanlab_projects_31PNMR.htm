phosphorus regeneration 31p nmr selective phosphorus regeneration of sinking marine particles evidence from 31 p nmr phosphorus p regeneration and transformation in the oceanic water column and in marine sediments depend on the chemical nature of the sinking particulate p pool we have characterized the molecular composition of this pool in various oceanic settings and water depths using 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy both inorganic p orthophosphate pyrophosphate polyphosphate and organic p compounds orthophosphate monoesters orthophosphate diesters phosphonates were identified the relatively high abundance of inorganic p suggests that considerable transformation from the organic to the inorganic pool occurs in the water column some of this inorganic p may be present in association with mineral phases apatite clays oxyhydroxides and thus may not be bio available the distribution of organic p compounds in the sinking particulate matter pool is generally similar in composition to phytoplankton and significantly different than in the dissolved organic matter pool results indicate that in most oceanic regions the majority of p regeneration occurs at very shallow depths hydrolysis of p compounds continues throughout the water column as indicated by a decrease in total particulate p with depth and a relative decrease in the organic p fraction at some sites orthophosphate monoesters dominate the organic p pool at all locations followed by orthophosphate diesters phosphonates are present in a few samples but never contribute more than 6 of total extractable p compared to 25 abundance in the dissolved organic p pool this work shows that considerable spatial and temporal variability in the molecular composition of sinking particulate p exists
