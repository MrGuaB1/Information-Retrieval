adaptive algorithms for online optimization adaptive algorithms for online optimization elad hazan ibm almaden wednesday february 27 2008 4 30 5 30 pm terman engineering center room 453 abstract in this talk we study the notion of learning in an oblivious changing environment existing online learning algorithms which minimize regret are shown to converge to the average of all locally optimal solutions we propose a new performance metric strengthening the standard metric of regret to capture convergence to locally optimal solutions we then describe a series of reductions which transform algorithms for minimizing standard regret into adaptive algorithms albeit incurring only poly logarithmic computational overhead we describe applications of this technique to various well studied online problems such as online routing portfolio management and the tree update problem in all cases we explain how previous algorithms perform suboptimally and how the reduction technique gives adaptive algorithms our reductions combine techniques from data streaming algorithms composition of learning algorithms and a novel use of unbiased gradient estimates this talk is self contained no prior knowledge in machine learning or optimization is required joint work with c seshadhri princeton university operations research colloquia http or stanford edu oras_seminars html
