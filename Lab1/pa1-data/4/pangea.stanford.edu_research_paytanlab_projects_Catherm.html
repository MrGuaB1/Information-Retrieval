ca isotope paleo thermometer ca isotopes in corals as a new paleo thermometer increasing temperatures due to a greenhouse effect could have major implications on sea level shifting of climate belts and alteration of habitats in order to understand the potential consequences of anthropogenic perturbations of our environment in an attempt to monitor and predict future global climate change it would be worthwhile to study anaturala temperature changes that have occurred in the geological past such temperature fluctuations are recorded in the chemical and isotopic composition of marine carbonate skeletal material such as foraminifers and corals paleo climate studies of coral skeletal aragonite show that past seasonal and inter annual variability in sea surface temperature sst can be reconstructed using chemical tracers in some cases interpretation of records established using different proxies are not consistent a multi proxy approach to coral based sst reconstruction is thus useful for both error checking and validation purposes and may also allow other environmental parameters to be determined ca isotope ratios have been suggested as a potential paleo thermometer but have never been examined in corals this work is an attempt to measure the ca isotope ratio of corals and establish the potential of this record for reconstruction of sst ca isotopic results will be compared to instrumental sea surface temperature records as well as to d18o and sr ca ratio for the same samples if indeed the ca isotope record in corals captures the changes in sst this paleo thermometer has tremendous potential for climate reconstruction as the ca isotopic signal is unlikely to be very susceptible to diagenetic alteration
