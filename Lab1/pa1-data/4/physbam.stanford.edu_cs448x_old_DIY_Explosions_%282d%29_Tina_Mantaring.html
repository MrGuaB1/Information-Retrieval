diy explosions tina mantaring diy explosions tina mantaring diy explosions a do it yourself guide to creating your own explosions by tina mantaring explosions are something we see more in the movies than in real life we ve seen virtually everything explode from small packages to big buildings to entire cities and even planets very few of these explosions however are real while most of the smaller ones are feasible as you increase in scale they become either too expensive or physically impossible to create in real life one technique for getting around this involves building miniature models but while this can be fun it doesn t give you the detail and the impact that highly sophisticated animation software can this project aims to teach others how to recreate some of the famous explosions that we ve seen in movies i have no intention of matching the quality of the effects found in movies but i want to be able to explore what can be done given a limited amount of time and resources the end product will hopefully be a series of video tutorials of how to create realistic explosions yourself outline of project background famous explosions in movies how these explosions were created eg real explosions miniature models cg software used in rendering cg explosions anatomy of an explosion fire dust sound aftershocks exploding medium i ll be looking at what these components are and how to simulate them with simple methods and prebuilt filters effects eg particle systems that are available in either maya or 3ds max tutorials a simple explosion project webpage 2011 03 29 17 43
