cloth project cloth project contacts jon su cloth simulation has become a staple in the special effects industry with simulation being able to achieve realistic looking cloth with varying material properties realistic folds and wrinkles and robust self and object collisions however cloth simulation is also incredibly expensive making it difficult to use in the film industry and impractical to use in games and other real time applications the goal of this project is to reevaluate the algorithms found in modern cloth solvers and along with utilizing modern hardware to make film quality cloth simulation more efficient papers selle a su j irving g and fedkiw r robust high resolution cloth using parallelism history based collisions and accurate friction ieee tvcg 15 339 350 2009
