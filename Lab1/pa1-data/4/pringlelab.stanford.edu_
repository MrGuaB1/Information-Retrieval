pringle lab people projects pictures publications protocols places play for many years the pringle laboratory has exploited the awesome power of yeast as a genetically tractable model eukaryote to investigate fundamental problems in cell and developmental biology such as the mechanisms of cell polarization and of cytokinesis this work continues but we are now also applying the model system approach to studies of the cellular and molecular biology of the cnidarian dinoflagellate symbiosis which is critical to the lives of reef building corals to this end we are using the small sea anemone aiptasia pallida which has huge advantages over corals as an experimental organism some of our studies involve collaboration with coral biologists in which we try to connect our laboratory studies to observations made on corals in the field 356 edwards building 300 pasteur drive stanford ca 94305 phone 650 723 8465 fax 650 723 8526
