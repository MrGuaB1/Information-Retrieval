swplab research time lapse research projects time lapse tomography conventional time lapse imaging methods rely on the repeatability of the acquisition geometries to extract subsurface variations the usual approach is to record a baseline survey at the beginning of the monitoring stage and repeated surveys every couple of years or so a problem with the conventional approach is that although it is assumed that the properties in each location may change with time property distributions at each time are not statistically independent it would then not be appropriate to consider each reconstruction separately since if the successive reconstructions are carried out independently we can lose much of the time sequential information we are developing techniques to use time sequential information to better constrain time lapse inversion one approach is the joint inversion of multiple time lapse data with temporal regularization in this case data recorded at different times are inverted simultaneously a more practical approach which inverts the time lapse data sequentially as it is recorded is being developed global climate and energy project gcep acoustical resonance spectroscopy 3 d vsp tomography waves in media with complex and multi scale heterogeneity monitoring production of coal bed methane characterization of the near subsurface using seismic and radar data computational geophysics back to research
