characteristics of oxygen reduction on nanocrystalline ysz ecs transactions 13 97 2008 characteristics of oxygen reduction on nanocrystalline ysz ecs transactions 13 97 2008 hong huang joon hyun shim cheng chieh chao rojana pornprasertsuk masayuki sugawara turgut m gur fritz prinz abstract in this paper we present a series of experimental results indicating improved oxygen reduction characteristics on nanocrystalline ysz surfaces we compare 1 cathodic interface impedances on nanocrystalline and microcrystalline ysz 2 oxygen exchange rate on and bulk diffusivity in nano ysz and single crystal ysz and 3 bulk and surface conductivities of nano ysz the results collectively indicate that oxygen reduction exchange rate is faster on nanocrystalline ysz than on micro and single crystal ysz which likely is related to fast oxygen transport on the surface
