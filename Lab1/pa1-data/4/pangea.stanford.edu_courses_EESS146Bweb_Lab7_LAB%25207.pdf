lab 7 abyssal circulation page 1 lab 7 abyssal circulation please turn in your lab notebook with your description of lab 7 at the beginning of class on monday may 24 th in this lab we will perform two demonstrations to study the physics of the abyssal circulation by looking at the response of a rotating tank of water on a topographic beta plane to a source of water this is known as the stommel arons experiment overturning circulations driven by mixing of density in a stratified tank of water mixed by rising air bubbles in your lab notebook make sure to describe the configuration of the demonstrations summarize what you observed describe the path that the water in the stommel arons experiment takes after it leaves the source region explain this behavior in terms of the taylor proudman effect sketch how the density in the stratified tank is modified by the mixing associated with the rising air bubbles sketch the structure of the vertical velocity and overturning circulation that would be required to balance this mixing by vertical advection of density how does this compare to what you observed it has been proposed that the movement of jellyfish could contribute to driving the abyssal circulation see figure below using the analogy of the rising air bubbles in the stratified tank with the movement of jellyfish in the ocean explain how this might work fluorescein dye marks the movement of water entrained in the wake of a jellyfish to see a video of jellyfish tagged with dye visit http www youtube com watch v poaqljx_sfu figure adapted from katija and dabiri 2009 katija k dabiri jo 2009 a viscosity enhanced mechanism for biogenic ocean mixing nature 460 624 626
