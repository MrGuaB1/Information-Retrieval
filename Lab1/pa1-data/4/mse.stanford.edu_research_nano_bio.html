stanford school of materials schience and engineering stanford engineering intranet nano and biological materials nanoscale stealth probe slides into cell walls seamlessly melosh group stanford engineers have created a nanoscale probe they can implant in a cell wall without damaging the wall the probe could allow researchers to listen in on electrical signals within the cell that could lead to a better understanding of how cells communicate or how a cell responds to medication the probe could also provide a better way of attaching neural prosthetics and with modification might be an avenue for inserting medication inside a cell read stanford led research team aims for rapid detection of radiation dose wang group researchers think blood proteins may hold key to developing instruments for use by first responders labs in the event of nuclear incidents read stanford researchers magnetic nanotags spot cancer in mice earlier than current methods wang group improved magnetic nano sensor chips are up to 1000 times more sensitive than current methods of cancer detection can scan any bodily fluid with high accuracy and search for up to 64 different cancer associated proteins simultaneously read view technical report stanford home engineering home mse home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students companies alumni home faculty directory faculty research areas research profiles faculty open positions research centers affiliate programs admissions giving to mse contacts
