swplab research dars research projects 3d vsp adaptative 3 d tomography for vertical seismic profiles the main goal of this project is the development of a tomographic reconstruction method for estimating 3 d velocity and the geometry of reflectors from a joint inversion of transmission and reflection travel times the approach is to extend the traditional techniques of cross well tomography to the 3 d vsp the 3 d vsp has better angular coverage than cross well tomography and the joint inversion of transmission and reflection events will provide good quantitative estimates of seismic properties that can be used to estimate the reservoir properties and the positions of structural and stratigraphic interfaces way from the well to be able to invert these large 3 d datasets we propose a parameterization of the velocity model in an adaptive unstructured grid that will be adapted to model resolution due to the dimensions of the inverse problem several different inversion techniques will be investigated with emphasis on techniques that are efficient on parallel beowulf style clusters possible methods are conjugated gradient gmres figure 1 3 d vsp acquisition geometry illustrates the ray paths of transmission and reflected waves figure2 preliminary results from 1 d tomography applied to twenty shots from the san juan 3 d vsp dataset estimated layer velocities for long offset and near offset shots are different pattern of heterogeneity indicates need for consistent 3 d inversion global climate and energy project gcep acoustical resonance spectroscopy 3 d vsp tomography waves in media with complex and multi scale heterogeneity monitoring production of coal bed methane characterization of the near subsurface using seismic and radar data computational geophysics back to research
