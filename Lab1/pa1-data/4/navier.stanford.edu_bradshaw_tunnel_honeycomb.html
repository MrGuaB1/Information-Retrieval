wind tunnels honeycomb axial fan second diffuser screens honeycomb power estimation corner vanes first diffuser test section screens wide angle diffuser tunnel configuration contraction settling chamber screens like contractions reduce the longitudinal components of turbulence or mean velocity variation to a greater extent than the lateral components so that the number of screens to be used is determined by the acceptable lateral component disturbance in the test section the lateral components of mean velocity and of the larger turbulent eddies can be reduced more effectively by a honeycomb the mode of action of a honeycomb with cells elongated in the flow direction is qualitatively obvious but few tests have actually been made and all that is certain is that the cell length of the honeycomb should be at least six or eight times the cell diameter stacking two honeycombs together to get a larger effective length to diameter ratio is acceptable if the two are tightly laced together a honeycomb naturally produces some turbulence of its own with eddy sizes of the same order as the cell diameter which decays very much more slowly than the small scale turbulence produced by screens the early wind tunnels which had a honeycomb but no screens and usually a very small contraction ratio also suffered from a very high turbulence intensity in the test section although the mean flow was often quite good most modern tunnels have both honeycomb and screens the cells in the kraft paper honeycomb used for lightweight doors are not very uniform but the walls are usually quite accurately perpendicular to the plane of the honeycomb and length to diameter ratios of 6 or more can be found for large or high performance tunnels aluminum honeycomb used for aircraft sandwich construction is better but care should be taken to remove burrs usually fatigue failure can be induced by playing a high pressure air hose over the honeycomb honeycomb reference
