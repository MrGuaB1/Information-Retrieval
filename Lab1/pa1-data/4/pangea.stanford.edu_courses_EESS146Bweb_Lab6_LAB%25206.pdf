lab 6 baroclinic instability page 1 lab 6 baroclinic instability please turn in your lab notebook with your description of lab 6 at the beginning of class on monday may 10 th in this lab we will perform two demonstrations the cylinder release experiment cylinders of relatively fresh water surrounded by saltier water that are allowed to adjust under gravity and rotation the annulus experiment an annular ring of water on a rotating table driven by a radial temperature difference that illustrate the formation of baroclinic instabilities and eddies in your lab notebook make sure to describe the configuration of the demonstrations summarize what you observed comment on the relative amounts of available potential energy ape associated with the different cylinders of fresh water and describe the manner in which the ape is released to generate kinetic energy contrast the circulation induced by the radial temperature difference in the annulus experiment to what we observed in lab 2 ie the hadley cell demonstration comment on the different way heat is transported in the two systems ie where in the vertical the heat transport is largest what flows are responsible for the heat transport etc describe how the movement of warm and cold core eddies that form near the gulf stream see figure below transport heat meridionally even though their temperature anomalies average to zero over time relate this process to what you observed in the annulus experiment an image of the sea surface temperature in the proximity of the gulf stream showing the northward and southward propagation of warm and cold core rings respectively
