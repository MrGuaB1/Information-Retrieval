mangrove methane budget estimating the contribution of mangrove ecosystems to the global methane budget although wetlands are known to be a significant source of methane ch4 to the atmosphere methane flux estimates from tropical wetlands particularly tropical mangrove ecosystems remain limited we are currently collecting and analyzing sediment water and flux chamber samples from two tropical coastal lagoons in the yucatan peninsula to determine the amount of methane flux from these lagoons to the atmosphere and what factors affect this flux these two lagoons celestun and chelem experience similar seasonal weather patterns but have very different ground water inputs neither lagoon receives any river input and celestun has significant ground water input while chelem is mainly marine additionally we are using carbon and nitrogen isotopes to determine sources of organic matter to the sediment and radium isotopes to trace ground water discharge into one of the lagoons we are working in collaboration with tom lorenson and larry miller usgs menlo park and dr jorge herrera silveira head of the primary production laboratory at cinvestav ipn in merida yucatan
