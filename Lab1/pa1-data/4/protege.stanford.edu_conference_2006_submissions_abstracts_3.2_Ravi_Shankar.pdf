towards semantic interoperability in a clinical trials management system ravi d shankar stanford university abstract clinica page 1 towards semantic interoperability in a clinical trials management system ravi d shankar stanford university abstract clinical trials are studies in human patients to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of new therapies managing a clinical trial from its inception to completion typically involves multiple disparate applications facilitating activities such as trial design specification clinical sites management participants tracking and trial data analysis there remains however a strong impetus to integrate these diverse subsystems each supporting different but related functions of clinical trial management at syntactic and semantic levels so as to improve clarity consistency and correctness in specifying clinical trials and in acquiring and analyzing clinical data the situation becomes especially critical with the need to manage multiple clinical trials at various sites and to facilitate meta analyses on trials this paper introduces a knowledge based framework that we are building to support a suite of clinical trial management subsystems our initiative uses semantic technologies to provide a consistent basis for the subsystems to interoperate we are adapting this approach to the immune tolerance network itn an international research consortium developing new therapeutics in immune mediated disorders page 1
