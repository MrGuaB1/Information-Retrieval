molekel molecular visualization program software information molekel latest version 4.2 other installed versions 3.0 main web page www cscs ch molekel local documentation description molekel is a molecular graphics package for visualizing molecular and electronic structure data from a number of electronic structure program outputs gaussian 94 98 adf gamess us as well as from xyz and pdb files molekel represents molecules as wire frame stick ball and stick and spacefill representations measures atom atom distances angles and torsion angles molekel can superimpose molecules calculates and displays isosurfaces of electron and spin densities as well as molecular orbitals molekel uses texture mapping to color code any surface according to eg the molecular electrostatic potential is able to clip any surface by a clipping plane and to render it transparent molekel can animate and display vibrational modes animate geometry optimizations and multiple coordinate pdb and xyz files molekel can export coordinates in pdb and xyz format in original or modified orientation installed location usr local molekel supported platforms sgi linux windows running the code molekel notes known problems on linux the program may complain that it cannot find a dynamic link library libstdc++ libc6 1 2 so 3 if this happens it seems to work to make a softlink from the desired dll to libstdc++ 2 libc6 1 1 2.9 0 so in usr lib also there is a bug when reading molden files and displaying orbitals one must ensure that the atoms are grouped by atomic number in the atoms section of the molden file
