hms mlo microbial communities home biology physics records people dynamics of marine microbial communities we have recently established a set of protocols to monitor marine microbial communities with a new experimental approach using genome sequencing technology adapted to studying communities of species rather than genomes of genes these deep sequencing data sets have the power to detect 100000 of species at once we are working to adjust the current approach in such a way as to make it cost effective in marine environmental work and are moving forward with these studies
