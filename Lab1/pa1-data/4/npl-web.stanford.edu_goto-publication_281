in plane conductivities of atomic layer deposited yttria stabilized zirconia electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells ecs transactions 16 157 2009 in plane conductivities of atomic layer deposited yttria stabilized zirconia electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells ecs transactions 16 157 2009 cheng chieh chao joon seok park f b prinz abstract we investigated oxide ion conductivities of ultra thin 8 nm 55 nm yttria stabilized zirconia ysz films produced by atomic layer deposition ald in plane oxide ion conductivities were measured as a function of film thickness temperature and yttria concentration in the film we observed higher conductivities for thinner films due to the portion of oxide ion conduction along the surface increased we also observed changes in conductivities by modifying yttria concentrations near the surfaces and the optimal concentration near the surface was different from the bulk
