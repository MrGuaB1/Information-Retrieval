pollack lab homepage research cancer genomics our laboratory uses genomic approaches to investigate the pathogenesis and biology of human cancer and to identify strategies for improved cancer diagnosis prognostication and patient management technologies include dna microarrays deep sequencing and shrna screens and additional insight is provided by the biocomputational integration of different data types active areas of investigation include 1 characterizing molecular subtypes of prostate cancer to identify biomarkers for risk assessment 2 identifying recurrent dna copy number alterations and rearrangements in common epithelial tumor types eg breast prostate lung colon and pancreatic cancers to discover new cancer genes 3 understanding the role of newly discovered lineage dependent oncogenes in tumorigenesis and 4 investigating mechanisms underlying genomic instability and the shaping of cancer genomes
