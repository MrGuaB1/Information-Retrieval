lab 2 the thermal wind balance page 1 lab 2 the thermal wind balance please turn in your lab notebook with your description of lab 2 at the beginning of class on monday april 12 th in this lab we will perform three demonstrations illustrating the adjustment under gravity and rotation of the collapse of a cylinder of salty water surrounded by fresh water thermal wind shear driven by a radial temperature gradient precession in a gyroscopic pendulum in your lab notebook make sure to describe the configuration of the demonstrations summarize what you observed describe and sketch the time evolution of the cylinder collapse experiment highlighting the steps and forces involved during the spin up of the circulation compare the structure of the density field and the circulation seen in the cylinder collapse experiment to that of cold core rings observed to the south of the gulf stream see figure below describe how heat is transported in the thermal wind shear demonstration where in the water column is the radial heat transport largest observations of the thermal structure of a cold core ring found south of the gulf stream the center of the ring is at 300 km a movie showing the motion of surface drifters trapped in a cold core ring can be found at http www climode org meetings nov_04 edw2004_drifters mpg in the movie the cold core ring is at 37 n and 66w and is most prominent on day 2 27 2004
