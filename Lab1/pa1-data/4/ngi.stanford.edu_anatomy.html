the anatomy workbench the stanford teaching hand nlm ngi project the anatomy workbench the stanford teaching hand nlm ngi project project overview anatomy is fundamental to most health care disciplines yet as a subject the time alloted in the curriculum is decreasing steadily cadavers are expensive and may not be accessible the anatomy workbench proposes to teach anatomic understanding and the dissection of virtual anatomy over the internet the hand has been selected as a structure with complex anatomy and clear correlation between function and structure project status media for teaching has been collected these include photographs of dissections that encompass complete rotated views of the hand at many stages of dissection a 3d model of most tissues of the hand and animations of normal and pathologic function the network shown below is in the process of being developed a dynamics engine is being constructed to support realistic movement of the fingers in 3d the tissues will be given physical properties so that they can be felt with a virtual probe and will give a resistance back to the user's hand eventually the student will be able to pull on tendons with a palpable force and will feel the force exerted at the fingertip of the model all simulations will operate over the internet an image server has been developed to provide rapid access to the dissection images by moving the cursor the student can rotate the dissected hand or can change the level of the dissection funding nlm nih project personnel parvati dev pi parvati stanford edu w leroy heinrichs co pi kenneth waldron project manager sakti srivastava content development lead kevin montgomery technical lead steven senger technical co lead bharti temkin texas tech univ chris hasser immersion corp collaborators and students at stanford u wisconsin texas tech univ univ of pittsburgh
