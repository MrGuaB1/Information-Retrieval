stanford networking seminar 12 15pm thursday october 6 2011 gates 104 network troubleshooting from end hosts renata teixeira upmc sorbonne universite about the talk this talk will present our initial steps towards automatic network troubleshooting from end hosts our main contributions are the design of more accurate and efficient end host measurement methods we work both on techniques to detect faults and performance disruptions and to identify the location of the problem for fault identification we improve the two basic techniques using end to end measurements traceroute and network tomography first we show that traceroute the most widely used diagnosis tool reports erroneous paths in the presence of routers that perform load balancing we build paris traceroute to correct these errors second we design measurement methods for accurate fault identification using network tomography network tomography assumes up to date and correlated measurements of the status of end to end paths and of the network topology which are hard to get in practice we design techniques to track correlated path reachability and network topology finally we design techniques for lightweight detection of faults and performance disruptions we minimize the overhead of active end to end probing for fault detection and design a tool to collect passive measurements at end hosts about the speaker renata teixeira received the b sc degree in computer science and the m sc degree in electrical engineering from universidade federal do rio de janeiro brazil in 1997 and 1999 respectively and the ph d degree in computer science from the university of california san diego in 2005 during her ph d studies she worked at the at&t research she is currently a researcher with the centre national de la recherche scientifique cnrs at lip6 upmc sorbonne universite paris france her research interests are in measurement analysis and management of data networks more information at http rp lip6 fr teixeira
