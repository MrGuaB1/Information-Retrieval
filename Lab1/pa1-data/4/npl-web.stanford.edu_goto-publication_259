electrochemical deposition of metallic nanowires as a scanning probe tip ecs transactions 16 3 2009 electrochemical deposition of metallic nanowires as a scanning probe tip ecs transactions 16 3 2009 munekazu motoyama neil p dasgupta f b prinz abstract this paper describes ni electrodeposition for producing metallic nanowires as a nanoprobe tip a polycarbonate porous membrane was used as a template for the growth of nanowires on a si afm probe tip a focused ion beam fib was used to deposit a thin pt layer as the cathode with a controlled small area on the tip apex and the underlying membrane surface the produced nanowire afm probe showed compatibility with a conventional afm system we also demonstrated deposition of al2o3 by atomic layer deposition ald into the template with the aim of decreasing the nanowire diameters
