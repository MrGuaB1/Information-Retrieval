surface & aqueous geochemistry group homepage molecular environmental science our research focuses on phenomena that occur at solid water and biological interfaces that affect environmentally important processes such as trace element sorption and mineral alteration in aquatic and subsurface settings combining environmental chemistry geochemistry microbiology and surface science we develop and apply research tools to study simplified systems that underpin complexity in the natural environment many of these tools utilize synchrotron light sources including x ray absorption fine structure xafs spectroscopy scanning transmission x ray microscopy stxm x ray standing waves grazing incidence x ray absorption spectroscopy and synchrotron based x ray diffraction we conduct these experiments at the stanford synchrotron radiation lab the advanced light source and the advanced photon source current projects bio geochemical cycling of heavy metals and radionculides more spectroscopic studies of bacteria mineral interactions including biofilm growth and mineral alteration dissolution of mercury sulfide minerals by sulfur oxidizing bacteria chemical and physical processes controlling the transport of mercury from inoperative mines in california with an emphasis on colloidal phenomena more mercury release from contaminated anoxic sediments a study of dissolution desorption and precipitation of hg in sulfidogenic sediments more updated march 24 2007
