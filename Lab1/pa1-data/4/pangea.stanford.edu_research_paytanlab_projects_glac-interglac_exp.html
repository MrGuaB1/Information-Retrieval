glacial interglacial export production changes understanding the contribution of southern ocean glacial interglacial export production changes to global climate change biological productivity of the oceans is sensitive to changes in climate which can affect essential factors such as nutrients and light availability in turn ocean productivity may influence climate by regulating the partitioning of carbon dioxide a green house gas between the ocean and the atmosphere the southern ocean a present day high nutrient low chlorophyll hnlc region has been emphasized as a possible region where increased glacial productivity might have prevailed causing the lower atmospheric co2 concentrations during glacial periods paleoceanographic studies of the southern ocean have however failed to provide unambiguous evidence for increased rates of primary production during glacial periods in order to better understand the oceanic controls on productivity hence on atmospheric co2 fluctuations we are using the accumulation rate of marine barite a mineral that is strongly correlated to marine productivity in the water column and is highly resistant to burial remineralization in oxic sediments to reconstruct and quantify the history of ocean productivity in the southern ocean over the past 400000 years marine barite under sem
