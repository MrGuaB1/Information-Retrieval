nanoscale prototyping laboratory for energy conversion and storage nanoscale prototyping laboratory for energy conversion & storage nanoscale prototyping laboratory for energy conversion and storage sunday mar 18 2012 50 f 15 c stanford ca welcome to the nanoscale prototyping laboratory at stanford our team creates models and prototypes nanoscale structures to understand the physics of electrical energy conversion and storage we are exploring the relation between size composition and the kinetics of charge transfer we are also interested in learning from nature in particular by studying the electron transport chain in plant cells we employ a wide range of nano fabrication technologies to build and evaluate prototype structures such technologies include atomic layer deposition scanning probe microscopy and impedance spectroscopy in addition we use molecular scale modeling to gain insights into the nature of charge separation and recombination processes fritz b prinz finmeccanica professor of engineering robert bosch chairman of mechanical engineering stanford university stanford home engineering home npl home contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved about people research publications partners contact us
