powernet powernet a magnifying glass for computing systems energy home power data comments about about powernet the power consumption of computing equipment in edication and eterprise buildings is estimated at about 1.5 of all us conusumption source doe annual energy review the stanford powernet project aims to characterize computing infrastructures in terms of energy and utilization high granularity data about how computers monitors servers and network switches are used over time can reveal ways in which the overal power consumption of a building can be reduced currently students staff and professors in the stanford cs department have power meters between their devices and electrical outlets the monitoring infrastructure collects power readings every one second some power meters report data over ethernet while about 80 meters form an ad hoc low power wireless network that routes data to a central basestation in addition to power there are a number of user machines reporting cpu statistics we also monitor network traffic in oder to correlate user demands to the energy cost of satisfying those demands for more information read the hotpower 09 workshop paper read our 2010 tech report get the power meter board files here students maria kazandjieva brandon heller omprakash gnawali post doc faculty philip levis christos kozyrakis nick mckeown
