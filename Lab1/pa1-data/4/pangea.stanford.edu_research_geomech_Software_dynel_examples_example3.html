dynel example 3 forward modeling dynel can be used to performe forward modeling of different tectonic environments by setting the appropriate boundary conditions or constraints for example when modeling large deformation associated with thrust or normal faulting special constraints can be imposed on the discontinuous surfaces that represent the faults in the following models the fault contact is set to be sticky that is opening and interpenetration are not allowed figure 1 is an example of extensional tectonics with a listric fault and its conjugate fault figure 2 shows the configuration and results of a model that simulates compressive tectonics with imbricated thrust sheets figure 1 sequential simulation of extensional tectonics with a listric fault and its conjugate fault see animation figure 2 sequential simulation of compressive tectonics with imbricated thrust sheets see animation copyright the stanford rock fracture project 2002
