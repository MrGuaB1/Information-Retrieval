impact ordering next up previous contents index next cluster pruning up efficient scoring and ranking previous static quality scores and contents index impact ordering in all the postings lists described thus far we order the documents consistently by some common ordering typically by document id but in section 7.1 4 by static quality scores as noted at the end of section 6.3 3 such a common ordering supports the concurrent traversal of all of the query terms postings lists computing the score for each document as we encounter it computing scores in this manner is sometimes referred to as document at a time scoring we will now introduce a technique for inexact top retrieval in which the postings are not all ordered by a common ordering thereby precluding such a concurrent traversal we will therefore require scores to be accumulated one term at a time as in the scheme of figure 6.14 so that we have term at a time scoring the idea is to order the documents in the postings list of term by decreasing order of thus the ordering of documents will vary from one postings list to another and we cannot compute scores by a concurrent traversal of the postings lists of all query terms given postings lists ordered by decreasing order of two ideas have been found to significantly lower the number of documents for which we accumulate scores 1 when traversing the postings list for a query term we stop after considering a prefix of the postings list either after a fixed number of documents have been seen or after the value of has dropped below a threshold 2 when accumulating scores in the outer loop of figure 6.14 we consider the query terms in decreasing order of idf so that the query terms likely to contribute the most to the final scores are considered first this latter idea too can be adaptive at the time of processing a query as we get to query terms with lower idf we can determine whether to proceed based on the changes in document scores from processing the previous query term if these changes are minimal we may omit accumulation from the remaining query terms or alternatively process shorter prefixes of their postings lists these ideas form a common generalization of the methods introduced in sections 7.1 2 7.1 4 we may also implement a version of static ordering in which each postings list is ordered by an additive combination of static and query dependent scores we would again lose the consistency of ordering across postings thereby having to process query terms one at time accumulating scores for all documents as we go along depending on the particular scoring function the postings list for a document may be ordered by other quantities than term frequency under this more general setting this idea is known as impact ordering next up previous contents index next cluster pruning up efficient scoring and ranking previous static quality scores and contents index 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
