absorption and reflection activity demonstration absorption and reflection this activity will demonstrate that radiation from the sun sunlight can be converted to heat energy by absorption and also that solar radiation can also be reflected time requirement 50 minutes as an activity 20 minutes as a demonstration materials 2 paper cups not insulated 2 thermometers 1 sheet of white paper 1 sheet of black or other dark paper wall clock with second hand scotch tape procedures wrap each paper cup with a different color paper tape the paper to the cups if necessary make a lid for each cup with the same color paper as the cup poke a hole in each lid the same size as the thermometer make sure that the thermometer will fit snugly in the hole place each cup in direct sunlight and insert the thermometers through each lid observe the temperature of each thermometer while keeping an eye on the clock observation questions what was the beginning temperature for each cup how long did it take before the temperature in at least one of the cups began to rise how long did it take for the hottest cup to reach its maximum temperature what was the difference in temperature of the two cups after the temperatures of the cups stabilized why did the cup s heat up why would one cup have a higher temperature inside do cars with dark interiors heat up more than cars with light interiors when they are in direct sunlight why last updated september 02 1997 joe twicken joe nova stanford edu rob wigand
