benson lab research home what's new sally benson lab members publications presentations rel perm curves research interests the benson lab was formed in spring 2007 when sally benson joined the stanford faculty our laboratory studies fundamental aspects of geologic carbon dioxide sequestration in saline aquifers we are able to replicate reservoir salinity temperature and pressure conditions upon cores of rock and flow mixtures of co 2 and brine a medical ct scanner is used to image the distribution of co 2 and brine inside the rock in real time our main interest is in the methods by which co 2 is immobilized in rock better understanding of the relative permeability of co 2 and brine is essential to this goal currently our focus is to investigate the sensitivity of relative permeability to injection flow rate and various fluid properties such as viscosity pressure temperature and interfacial tension the importance of relative permeability injection rate and wells the limit on co 2 injection rate is the overpressure limit of the geologic formation therefore because pressure is fixed the injection rate is determined by relative permeability relative permeability can essentially determine the number of injection wells needed something critically important when determining capture and storage costs and feasibility monitoring predicting co 2 leakage volumes and the spatial extent of the plume are critical steps in designing an optimal monitoring scheme relative permeability of the co 2 brine system is an essential input to these calculations as it governs the mobility of each phase in the storage reservoir as well as in pathways out of the injection zone for example periodic seismic surveys may be the ideal means to track a co 2 plume that is spreading over a large area whereas observation of pressure transients within the storage zone or an overlying zone may be adequate to monitor a localized plume understanding the relative permeability of the system is therefore crucial in making the appropriate choice extent of the plume the size of the plume is controlled by relative permeability the lower the relative permeability the larger the plume can be if relative permeability is very low co 2 will not sweep across the reservoir as efficiently and will instead move in isolated channels leading to low storage capacity and large plume size which determines the geographic area that must be monitored leakage potential identifying likely leakage pathways is a significant component of the overall assessment of a co 2 storage reservoir furthermore a particular site may have multiple potential pathways including abandoned wells nearby faults or a fractured cap rock each of which must be evaluated quantitatively from a risk standpoint in order to accomplish this the relative permeability of the co 2 brine system must be known since the ease of flow through any of the potential paths is dictated by this fundamental mechanism the flow of relative permeability studies
