two sided modifications of levy processes two sided modifications of levy processes sren asmussen department of mathematical statistics aarhus university denmark wednesday january 12 2005 4 30 5 45 pm terman engineering center room 453 abstract a levy process x is an independent sum of a linear drift a brownian motion and a pure jump process say a stable process a nig process or just a compound poisson process we define the two sided reflected version v as solution of a skorokhod problem v t v 0 x t l 0 t l k t where l 0 l k are the local times at the two boundaries 0 k the loss rate l k is the stationary expectation of l k 1 say l k is the overflow rate of a dam or the bit loss rate in a data buffer we give an expression for l k in terms of the parameters of the levy process and the stationary distribution it is notable that this problem is trivial in discrete time with one sided reflection and for certain specific levy processes also the asymptotics of l k as k goes to infinity is determined both with light and with heavy tails of the levy measure we finally look at the asymptotics as k goes to infinity of a one sided reflected version of x with the levy measure truncated at k joint work with mats pihlsgard lund sweden operations research colloquia http or stanford edu oras_seminars html
