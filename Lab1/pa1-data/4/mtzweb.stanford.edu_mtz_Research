research in the martinez group mtzweb stanford edu skip to main content home login home news people research publications software navigation research people publications the martinez group is focused on developing the ability to design molecular systems with desired functions from first principles one of the major obstacles in this quest has been the need for methods that are both accurate and computationally efficient so that a large portion of chemical space can be sampled and explored in particular we envision that theory and computation are poised to successfully design light driven and force driven molecular devices the work we do in the group falls roughly into four general categories excited state dynamics development of quantum chemistry codes for application on graphical processing units gpus chemistry under mechanical stress or mechanochemistry and development of explicitly correlated ab initio methods excited state dynamics our research bridges the gap between traditional molecular dynamics what are the atoms doing and quantum chemistry what are the electrons doing we are especially interested in electronic excited states where both of these questions must be answered before a cohesive picture of chemistry can emerge we have developed the unique capability to perform first principles simulations of photochemistry simultaneously solving both the nuclear and electronic schrodinger equations read more about excited state dynamics explicitly correlated methods many interesting and potentially important molecules and clusters can not be described by modern electronic structure methods due to the presence of strongly correlated electrons examples of such systems include transition metal clusters transition states of chemical reactions and excited electronic states we recently proposed an approach based on variational optimization of a traditional mcscf wave function multiplied by a jastrow factor represented by two electron geminals read more about explicitly correlated methods mechanochemistry we are interested in understanding how mechanical stresses can affect the chemical properties in materials particularly mechanosensitive polymers whose properties can respond to physical stress it has long been understood that mechanical force could lead to covalent bond cleavage as one might guess from observing a rubber band stretched beyond its breaking point however this mechanochemistry is typically non selective and only recently has it been demonstrated that a localized chemical unit that is more force sensitive than other parts of the polymer chain read more about mechanochemistry quantum chemistry on the gpu detailed simulations based on the principles of quantum mechanics play an ever increasing role in suggesting guiding and explaining experiments in chemistry and materials science in fact quantum chemistry is one of the major consumers of cpu cycles at national supercomputer centers the rise to prominence of computational chemistry was largely driven by early demonstrations of the predictive power of quantum mechanics applied to chemical problems and the tremendous advances in computing power over the past decades read more about quantum chemistry on the gpu
