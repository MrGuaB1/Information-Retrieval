wildcard queries next up previous contents index next phrase queries up vector space scoring and previous boolean retrieval contents index wildcard queries wildcard and vector space queries require different indexes except at the basic level that both can be implemented using postings and a dictionary eg a dictionary of trigrams for wildcard queries if a search engine allows a user to specify a wildcard operator as part of a free text query for instance the query rom restaurant we may interpret the wildcard component of the query as spawning multiple terms in the vector space in this example rome and roman would be two such terms all of which are added to the query vector the vector space query is then executed as usual with matching documents being scored and ranked thus a document containing both rome and roma is likely to be scored higher than another containing only one of them the exact score ordering will of course depend on the relative weights of each term in matching documents 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
