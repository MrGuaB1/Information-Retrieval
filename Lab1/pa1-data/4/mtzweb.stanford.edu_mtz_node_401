mechanochemistry mtzweb stanford edu skip to main content home login home news people research publications software navigation research people publications we are interested in understanding how mechanical stresses can affect the chemical properties in materials particularly mechanosensitive polymers whose properties can respond to physical stress it has long been understood that mechanical force could lead to covalent bond cleavage as one might guess from observing a rubber band stretched beyond its breaking point however this mechanochemistry is typically non selective and only recently has it been demonstrated that a localized chemical unit that is more force sensitive than other parts of the polymer chain we employ ab initio dynamics techniques on potential energy surfaces that have been modified to incorporate the application of forces this approach led to the design of a polymer that incorporates spiropyran and changes color when a force is applied
