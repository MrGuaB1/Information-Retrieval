axiomatic attribution for multilinear functions on finite ar approximations for second order stochastic processes ravi r mazumdar university research chair professor department of electrical and computer engineering university of waterloo tuesday february 21 2011 4 30 5 30 pm nano room 232 abstract the talk will focus on the approximation of a regular stationary time series by finite ar models this problem has a long and distinguished history going back to the work of wold parzen hannan and akaike i will present a brief overview about the previous results and then i will present new results on the convergence of the spectral density of the finite dimensional approximations as the order goes to infinity specifically we show that a sufficient condition is that the spectral density is strictly positive in pi pi and that the coefficients of the wold decomposition are in l1 i will then address the spectrum estimation problem and show that under the assumption that the stationary sequence is strongly mixing the order of the ar approximation should scale as o n 1 3 for convergence of the spectral density estimate in mean square where n denotes the number of observations joint work with s datta gupta waterloo and pw glynn stanford operations research colloquia http or stanford edu oras_seminars html
