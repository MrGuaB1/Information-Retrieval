htgl materials research projects in material synthesis and processing plasma synthesis combustion synthesis vapor synthesis plasma synthesis of materials plasmas both low and atmospheric pressure can be used as a rich source of reactive radical species which can interact with surfaces to either transport condensable species plasma deposition or modify microstructure and composition etching this heterogeneous chemistry can result in the synthesis of highly valuable metastable solid phases such as diamond the deposition of thin insulating films on silicon or the etching of silicon to form microelectronic features we have ongoing experimental and theoretical programs that involve the study of the basic gas phase and surface mechanisms responsible for diamond synthesis the synthesis and deposition of both thin film oxides nitrides and refractory metals and the etching of silicon facilities include atmospheric pressure rf and dc arc sources low pressure arcjets rf and microwave glow discharges and a spark ablation reactor a major emphasis is on the diagnostics of the gas phase and surface during deposition on and etching using laser induced fluorescence and degenerate four wave mixing spectroscopies combustion synthesis of diamond the use of combustion sources in the synthesis of diamond is becoming increasingly more popular combustion synthesis provides a number of advantages over plasma technologies in the growth of diamond films an improved understanding of the flame and heterogeneous chemistry under very fuel rich conditions will provide the basis for future reactor designs we have ongoing experimental and theoretical programs to study diamond synthesis in low pressure flames vapor synthesis processes in microelectronic device fabrication the fabrication of microscopic features on silicon in the production of microelectronic devices requires an improved understanding of the transport and reactivity of gas phase species in microscopic vias and trenches in the synthesis of insulating layers such as silicon dioxide on patterned silicon for example or in the fabrication of metal interconnects it is important to successfully predict the deposit profile evolution as scale lengths in emerging technologies get smaller 1 mm the flow of species within such structures is essentially free molecular we have an ongoing program that involves the detailed modeling of the transport and synthesis of thin films in such microsc opic structures emphasis is placed on the coupling of the transport to detailed surface chemistry and the numerical techniques employed to accommodate a continuously evolving surface a list of current and recent projects in material synthesis and processing along with the name of the faculty and ph d students involved is given here the last item is the name of the sponsor prof mark cappelli dr joongsoo kim jin seok ji diagnostics for plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and etch systems nasa darren berns katrin schwendner low density impinging reacting plasma jets for thin film synthesis nsf michael loh alan kull low temperature large area synthesis of diamond films using dc arcjet plasmas daimler benz corporation alex glew rf plasma synthesis of diamond like carbon films on video tape recorder heads lg electronics inc scott crawford synthesis of advanced substrates for packaging of power electronic devices sima otl cis prof ron hanson choi carlson multiplexed diode laser absorption sensors for semiconductor process control sima cis chou shang i multiplexed diode laser absorption sensors for semiconductor process control sima cis stouklov igor cfx diagnostics with cavity ring down spectroscopy lamresearch inc prof charles kruger dr thomas g owano edward h wahl hugh t stinnette nonequilibrium plasma chemistry department of energy dr thomas g owano maosheng zhao atmospheric pressure plasma chemical vapor deposition engineering research center for plasma aided manufacturing dr thomas g owano maosheng zhao nonequilibrium plasma processing of advanced materials national science foundation back to research topics page maintained by perry thoorsell last updated august 17 2005
