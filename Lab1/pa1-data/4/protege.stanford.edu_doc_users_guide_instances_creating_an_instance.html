creating an instance creating a instance directly creating instances is part of the iterative process of developing a protege 2000 project before you create instances you need to have created and organized the classes and slots that model your knowledge base structure creating instances can give you valuable information about the project structure and its applicability as you add instances to your project you may expose missing or redundant areas which tell you that you need to redesign some of the class slot structure however as you move classes and create and delete slots you may lose information in your instances in addition it is difficult to split a single instance into two or more instances therefore you should not add an extensive base of instances until you believe the structure of your project is fairly stable there are two ways to create an instance you can create an instance directly from the direct instances pane this is described below you can create an instance from an instance field for another instance see creating an instance from a field creating an instance from the direct instances pane creates the instance directly in the selected class to create a new instance from the direct instances pane in the class pane at the instances tab highlight the class where you want the instance to appear click the c reate button which appears as a in the instance buttons at the right of the direct instances pane the new instance will appear in the direct instances pane it will have a default name such as project_instance_00001 use the instances form at the right to fill in the slots for the instance any required fields are outlined in red next creating an instance from a field instances table of contents
