protege & clips home overview documentation downloads support community wiki about us users developers protege and clips protege uses the clips text file format as its default save load file format for both classes and instances if you look at the pont and pins files containing respectively domain classes and instances in a text editor you will see that these are basically clips files protege itself does not make use of clips it merely uses clips file formats you should be able to read protege files directly into clips if you can t please report the bug so that we can fix it we have a number of users that use or at least have used this feature there are however two sorts of things that you need to be aware of compatible clips extensions as protege has evolved we have found it useful to introduce concepts which do not map directly to clips but are not really inconsistent with the clips view of the world an example is the protege idea of allowed classes for slots of type instance this information is stored in the clips file as clips extensions following the convention that these extension lines begin with the character sequence since is the clips comment character when clips parses the file it ignores the extra information when protege parses the file it uses the extra information protege extensions that fall into this category typically do not cause any really problems for clips users the compatible extensions are allowed classes facet slot documentation facet and project inclusion incompatible clips extensions protege has evolved away somewhat from the clips oo model so that some features that we support can no longer be mapped cleanly into clips the biggest example of this is that protege now supports metaclasses classes whose instances are themselves classes if you choose to use metaclasses in your protege model then the resulting classes and instances may not be usable in clips in any real fashion the files can still be parsed as clips but the interpretation of the contents of the files is necessarily different another incompatibility though one which is quite tractable is the issue of slot name scope consider two completely unrelated classes foo and bar both classes have a slot a in clips these slots are not the same slot and their facets are unrelated in protege there is only one a slot though the facets may be overridden in one so that they don t have the same facets this slot is considered to be attached to both classes foo and bar in addition in protege slot names and class names are in the same namespace so they must be unique clips allows a class and a slot to have the same name protege allows frame names which are not valid clips names if you want to clips to be able to parse the files you will need to restrict your choice of frame names to those allowed by clips clips cool feature protege workaround modules not supported class slot names see above follow both clips and protege requirements no blank in names distinct names for classes and slots multiple inheritance yes abstract concrete yes reactive non reactive not supported post processing to add reactive specification to those classes that need it single field multifield slot yes default value facet no dynamic default storage facet local access facet read write inheritance propagation facet inherit source facet exclusive pattern match reactivity facet not supported visibility facet public create accessor facet read write override message facet not supported message handler not supported write message handlers in separate files definstance not supported post processing to wrap definstance around instances home overview documentation downloads support community wiki about us protege is a national resource for biomedical ontologies and knowledge bases supported by the national library of medicine protege is a core component of the national center for biomedical ontology copyright 2012 stanford center for biomedical informatics research valid xhtml 1.0 valid css
