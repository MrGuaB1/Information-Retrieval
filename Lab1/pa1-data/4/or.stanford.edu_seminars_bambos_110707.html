geometry of resource allocation and load balancing in computing communication systems geometry of resource allocation and load balancing in computing communication systems nick bambos stanford university wednesday november 07 2007 4 30 5 30 pm terman engineering center room 453 abstract we consider a processing system having several parallel buffers where classes of jobs tasks are queued up while awaiting execution at each point in time the system can be set to one of several available service modes each queue then receives service at a mode dependent rate modes correspond to feasible configurations of various processing resources the model unifies resource allocation situations in autonomic computing wireless transmitter power control packet switching etc taking a geometric perspective we discuss some new general families of algorithms which maximize the throughput by dynamically choosing service modes in response to observed buffer backlogs we also discuss issues pertaining to jitter and power control captured by this model
