martinez group photoinduced ring opening of cyclobutene using ab initio on the fly molecular simulations we have studied the photochemical ring opening reaction of cyclobutene our simulations provide for the first time direct evidence for immediate disrotatory ring opening motion on the excited electronic state the preference for the woodward hoffman predicted stereochemistry is established shortly within 15 femtoseconds after the electronic excitation and is therefore in principle observable via resonance raman spectroscopy these results see below together with an analysis of the character of the local and normal mode coordinates resolve the controversy regarding the interpretation of previous resonance raman experiments and suggest that additional ultrafast experiments are necessary snapshots of a typical excited state trajectory of cyclobutene following the electronic excitation the first motion is a stretching of the cc double bond this is followed by a change in hybridization of the methylene carbons and by a pronounced disrotatory motion the absolute value of the average disrotatory angle blue line and the average hch hybridization angle red line as a function of time in femtoseconds see inset for definitions of angles
