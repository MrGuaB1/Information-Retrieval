mars atmosphere seasonal temperature variations seasonal temperature variations variation of temperature with latitude at a constant pressure of 400 pa 4 mbar one temperature sample is obtained from each retrieved atmospheric profile through interpolation the black squares show results from a series of radio occultation measurements in january march 1998 this time period corresponded to early winter in the northern hemisphere ls 264 289 deg the red triangles show results from a second series of measurements in november december 1998 during late spring in the northern hemisphere ls 60 78 deg the horizontal blue line near 60 deg s latitude is the saturation temperature of carbon dioxide at 400 pa in early northern winter southern summer black squares temperature increases steadily with increasing latitude in the southern hemisphere the highest temperature near 65 deg s is 240 k in late northern spring southern fall red triangles the temperature gradient is reversed the temperature poleward of 60 deg s is nearly 100 k colder than before and has reached saturation the atmosphere is condensing into dry ice at the south pole note that temperatures at 60 deg n in late northern spring red triangles are significantly colder than temperatures at 60 deg s in early southern summer black squares due to a 20 increase in the distance from mars to the sun last updated november 17 1999 dave hinson joe twicken
