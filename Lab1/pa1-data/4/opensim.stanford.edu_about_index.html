ncsrr about ncsrr about ncsrr people contact about ncsrr bringing the power of engineering simulation to rehabilitation research musculoskeletal modeling and dynamic simulation have emerged as powerful tools to uncover the biomechanical causes of movement abnormalities and to design improved treatments we have established the nih national center for simulation in rehabilitation research ncsrr to equip the rehabilitation research community with state of the art simulation tools enabling investigators to complement experimental studies of human performance with advanced simulation software and biomechanical models our freely available simulation tool opensim is already used by hundreds of research teams around the world to advance rehabilitation science simulation of individual with cerebral palsy walking in a crouch gait more info courtesy of katherine m steele the center serves a wide audience from those on the leading edge of simulation technology to those wondering how simulations can benefit their work in addition to developing and distributing opensim ncsrr provides training opportunities seed grants and a network of biomechanical and clinical experts resources that will accelerate the integration of simulations into critical areas of rehabilitation including stroke spinal cord injury cerebral palsy osteoarthritis prosthetics orthotics and sports medicine email updates signup to join our mailing list news & announcements apply for the visiting scholars 2012 program dec 07 2011 applications for the ncsrr's visiting scholar program are now available opensim launches youtube channel dec 07 2011 visit opensim's youtube channel for a gallery of examples and video tutorials pilot project winners announced dec 01 2011 the ncsrr is pleased to announce the winners of the inaugural pilot project awards opensim reaches out to clinicians at aacpdm oct 15 2011 the ncsrr led a hands on session entitled simulation of human movement and gait pathology an introduction to opensim for the clinician at the annual meeting of the american academy for cerebral palsy and developmental medicine twenty surgeons physical therapists and other clinicians learned how opensim can be used to help plan surgery for children with cerebral palsy the opensim team encountered lots of enthusiasm and interest at the workshop which was their first time introducing simulation to this clinical conference visit the workshop's website to download slides and handouts from the workshop the national center for simulation in rehabilitation research ncsrr is a national center for medical rehabilitation research supported by research infrastructure grant r24 hd065690 from the national institute of child health & human development and the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering see the people page for a list of the many people who have contributed to the opensim project over the years 2010 ncsrr all rights reserved website design by david delp at viewfarm
