welcome to adobe golive 4 what is poly3dgui last new 2002 12 16 we are rewritting poly3dgui using the cross platform library qt poly3dgui is a c++ graphical user interface for poly3d gui written by frantz maerten using open inventor libraries for fast 3d rendering and running on pc laptop and desktop computers under windows 95 98 2000 nt or xp operating systems the gui enables the import export construction and editing of 3d surfaces that represent faults it has built in visualization tools to display output from poly3d as iso contours iso surfaces and vector representations of displacement strain and stress or user defined functions of these quantities see figure below many filters for data import export are included and are planned for common seismic geodetic and geologic sources the tools of matlab are recommended for further analysis and the construction of user designed plugins screen image of poly3dgui iso surfaces of coulomb stress arround a strike slip fault in a half space poly3dgui is built with the idea of expandability of functionality user customization and wizards to help the users build a model apply the boundary conditions and visualize and analyze the output in 3d in real time at the desktop the notion of plugins reinforces the robustness of this software by providing specific functionality to users the windows interface has major benefits because it is familiar easy to learn efficient to use and the hardware is inexpensive the icon menu and multiple windows environment are similar to common pc applications the rapid development of gigahertz processors and graphics cards for the pc means that very large models can be executed efficiently copyright the stanford rock fracture project 2002
