strong lp formulations and primal dual approximation algorithms strong lp formulations and primal dual approximation algorithms david shmoys school of operations research and information engineering cornell university wednesday january 19 2011 4 30 5 30 pm y2e2 101 abstract the state of the art of the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for np hard discrete optimization has advanced significantly over the past two decades furthermore the most prevalent approach has been to rely on the strength of natural linear programming relaxations work in computational integer programming over the same time period has shown the power of adding combinatorially motivated valid inequalities but this has not been employed often in the design of approximation algorithms we will show how this approach can be applied in the design and analysis of primal dual approximation algorithms we will present several recent approximation results along these lines starting with a surprisingly simple primal dual analogue of an lp rounding result of carr fleischer leung & phillips for the minimum cost covering knapsack problem the capacitated lot sizing problem and a location routing problem that arose recently in the context of determining bases for aircraft serving medical patients for the province of ontario for the last of these we will also discuss the motivating application in more detail along with a daily planning version of this problem that can be addressed via integer programming methods this is joint work with tim carnes operations research colloquia http or stanford edu oras_seminars html
