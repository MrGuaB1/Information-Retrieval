trash dna is what gets thrown away high rate of dna loss in drosophila page 1 gene 1997 dec 31 205 1 2 279 89 trash dna is what gets thrown away high rate of dna loss in drosophila petrov da hartl dl abstract we have recently described a novel method of estimating neutral rates and patterns of spontaneous mutation petrov et al 1996 this method takes advantage of the propensity of non ltr retrotransposable elements to create non functional dead on arrival copies as a product of transposition maximum parsimony analysis is used to separate the evolution of actively transposing lineages of a non ltr element from the fate of individual inactive insertions and thereby allows one to assess directly the relative rates of different types of mutation including point substitutions deletions and insertions because non ltr elements enjoy wide phylogenetic distribution this method can be used in taxa that do not harbor a significant number of bona fide pseudogenes as is the case in drosophila jeffs and ashburner 1991 weiner et al 1986 we used this method with helena a non ltr retrotransposable element present in the drosophila virilis species group a striking finding was the virtual absence of insertions and remarkably high incidence of large deletions which combine to produce a high overall rate of dna loss on average the rate of dna loss in d virilis is approximately 75 times faster than that estimated for mammalian pseudogenes petrov et al 1996 the high rate of dna loss should lead to rapid elimination of non essential dna and thus may explain the seemingly paradoxical dearth of pseudogenes in drosophila varying rates of dna loss may also contribute to differences in genome size graur et al 1989 petrov et al 1996 thus explaining the celebrated c value paradox john and miklos 1988 in this paper we outline the theoretical basis of our method examine the data from this perspective and discuss potential problems that may bias our estimates
