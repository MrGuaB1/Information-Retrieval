who is lucy 2.0 who is lucy 2.0 project overview the stanford visible female is a set of digital slices of the cadaveric pelvis of a reproductive age woman converted into a set of 3d models named lucy 2.0 the first digital female she is the namesake of lucy who lived an estimated 3.18 million years ago lucy's pelvis identified her as the first hominid biped and her mandible confirmed that she lived during that epoch an artists drawing of lucy and some 3d models of the lucy 2.0 pelvis appear below project status the surgical workbench includes a simulation of a pelvis lucy 2.0 as a 3d polygonal graphical object together with a representation of tissue biomechanics using physical modeling with virtual masses and springs at the polygon vertices and edges a real surgical tool such as a grasper for laparoscopic surgery controls a virtual tool that interacts with the virtual anatomy the virtual interaction results in computed resistive forces that are then used to drive motors that create a real resistance on the actual tool the user feels that s he is probing physical tissue the simulation has been separated into server and client components such that it can be operated over the internet network latency in the commercial internet can be a significant factor in the control of the virtual tool individual anatomic components of the pelvis appear in a set of information frames that provide multiple 2d & 3d images descriptions functions and queries about the structures some of the images are interactive thereby providing advanced learning techniques funding gifts and operating budget project personnel w leroy heinrichs md phd
