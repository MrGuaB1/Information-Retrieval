lab 5 wind driven gyres and westward propagation page 1 lab 5 wind driven gyres and westward propagation please turn in your lab notebook with your description of lab 5 at the beginning of class on monday may 3 rd in this lab we will perform two demonstrations using a topographic beta plane ie a rotating tank with a sloping bottom illustrating the generation of a gyre and a western boundary current by the stress imposed by a rotating lid the westward propagation of eddies in your lab notebook make sure to describe the configuration of the demonstrations summarize what you observed describe how the topographic beta plane mimics the north south gradient of the coriolis parameter on the spherical earth in particular note which sides of the tank are analogous to the northern southern eastern and western boundaries of an ocean basin and sketch the geostrophic contours sketch the surface stress associated with the rotating lid and its curl and the circulation that would follow the sverdrup relation to the west of the lid is there any frictional torque exerted on the water given your answer explain why the flow to the west of the lid tends to move along lines of constant depth compare the propagation of eddies generated with the shop vac in the lab to the propagation of eddies that form off of central america as seen in the figure and the animation sea level anomalies sla on february 23 1994 measured using satellite altimetry a series of anticyclonic eddies some of which were formed in the gulf of tehuantepec mexico are seen as highs in the sla to view an animation illustrating the westward propagation of these eddies visit http www aviso oceanobs com fileadmin images news image_du_mois 2006 200606_e ddies_anim mov credits noaa
