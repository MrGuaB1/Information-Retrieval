sr ca ratio proxy for chemical weathering and dissolution reconstructing the seawater sr ca ratio using marine barite in order to incite changes in chemical weathering rates and dissolution fluxes to the oceans recent evidence suggests that atmospheric chemistry ocean circulation and climate patterns have changed significantly with time in response to tectonic movement we suggest that changes in paleochemistry are strongly related to geo oceanographic events in order to determine the resulting fluxes of weathered silicate and carbonate materials a new high resolution method for determining sr ca molar ratios in marine barite will be employed averyt et al 2000 our research seeks to produce an accurate high resolution seawater sr ca ratio curve for the past 120 my 1 my resolution using marine barite extracted from deep sea sediments the resulting data will allow for development of a comprehensive global carbon model that will include carbonate versus silicate weathering rates and hydrothermal flux
