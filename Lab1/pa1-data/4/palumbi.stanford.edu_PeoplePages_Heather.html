heather galindo heather m galindo hmgalindo gmail com for many marine plants and animals the youngest life stages serve as the primary biological connections between geographically separated populations however these young stages are difficult to track in a coastal ocean environment because of their small size finding out about these biological connections is critical not only to understand how life in the ocean thrives but to inform important conservation and management decisions including the designing of marine reserve networks my research involves using both a computer simulation model and a field project with the acorn barnacle balanus glandula to look at how we can use population genetics to track larval dispersal in the coastal ocean i am also interested in the intersection of science public education and policy i am therefore developing an additional project to study how to effectively communicate policy relevant components of marine science back to people back to main page
