divisive clustering next up previous contents index next cluster labeling up hierarchical clustering previous optimality of hac contents index divisive clustering so far we have only looked at agglomerative clustering but a cluster hierarchy can also be generated top down this variant of hierarchical clustering is called top down clustering or divisive clustering we start at the top with all documents in one cluster the cluster is split using a flat clustering algorithm this procedure is applied recursively until each document is in its own singleton cluster top down clustering is conceptually more complex than bottom up clustering since we need a second flat clustering algorithm as a subroutine it has the advantage of being more efficient if we do not generate a complete hierarchy all the way down to individual document leaves for a fixed number of top levels using an efficient flat algorithm like means top down algorithms are linear in the number of documents and clusters so they run much faster than hac algorithms which are at least quadratic there is evidence that divisive algorithms produce more accurate hierarchies than bottom up algorithms in some circumstances see the references on bisecting means in section 17.9 bottom up methods make clustering decisions based on local patterns without initially taking into account the global distribution these early decisions cannot be undone top down clustering benefits from complete information about the global distribution when making top level partitioning decisions next up previous contents index next cluster labeling up hierarchical clustering previous optimality of hac contents index 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
