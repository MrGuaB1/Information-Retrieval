calcium isotopes and carbonate deposition history seawater calcium isotopes and carbonate deposition history changes in the amount of carbonate precipitation and dissolution have significant effects on oceanic alkalinity total co 2 and atmospheric co 2 thus climate knowledge of the carbonate depositional history is important for understanding the global calcium and carbon cycles and may lead to improved understanding of global biogeochemical cycles operation on earth on various time scales and the potential feedback mechanisms in these cycles and their effect on climate the calcium isotope ratio is seawater at any given time is largely controlled by biological precipitation of calcium carbonate a process that discriminates against heavy isotopes this fractionation causes seawater to be enriched in heavy calcium relative to the average isotopic ratio of input sources to the ocean therefore reconstruction of seawater ca isotope ratio could lead to an estimate of the fluctuations in the amount of calcium carbonate deposited in the oceans through time and to better understanding of the calcium and carbon cycles the mineral barite separated from deep sea sediments is used to trace the variations in seawater ca isotope ratios and to reconstruction of the calcium carbonate deposition history
