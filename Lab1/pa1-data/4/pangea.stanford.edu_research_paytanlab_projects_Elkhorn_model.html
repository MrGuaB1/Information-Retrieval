hydrodynamic model of elkhorn slough hydrodynamic modeling of elkhorn slough california gaurav is working with professor paytan and with professor stephen monismith in the environmental fluid mechanics lab over in the department of civil and environmental engineering his project involves the construction and verification of a hydrodynamic model of elkhorn slough down in monterey bay elkhorn slough is one of a select set of estuaries designated as national estuarine research reserves and the model will hopefully be used to enhance research and restorative activities in the estuary the model is being developed using the trim 3d hydrodynamic code invented by vincenzo casulli and often used at the efml the accuracy of the model will be verified by measuring radium isotope patterns throughout the slough using the same approach as other members of the paytan lab the decay rates of the different naturally occurring radium isotopes provides information as to the ages and circulation patterns of various water masses within the estuary these measurements can then be compared with the predictions of the model and the model can be adjusted until it effectively represents the estuary
