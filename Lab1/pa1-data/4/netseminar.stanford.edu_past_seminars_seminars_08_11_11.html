stanford networking seminar 12 15pm thursday august 11 2011 gates 104 broadband internet performance a view from the gateway srikanth sundaresan georgia tech about the talk we present the first study of network access link performance measured directly from home gateway devices policymakers isps and users are increasingly interested in studying the performance of internet access links because of many confounding factors in a home network or on end hosts however thoroughly understanding access network performance requires deploying measurement infrastructure in users homes as gateway devices in conjunction with the federal communication commission's study of broadband internet access in the united states we study the throughput and latency of network access links using longitudinal measurements we study the performance users achieve and how various factors ranging from the user's choice of modem to the isp's traffic shaping policies can affect performance our study yields many important findings about the characteristics of existing access networks our findings also provide insights into the ways that access network performance should be measured and presented to users which can help inform ongoing broader efforts to benchmark the performance of access networks about the speaker srikanth is a phd student at the georgia institute of technology atlanta usa where he works with professor nick feamster his current research interests include understanding home broadband internet performance across all layers he has also worked on intra domain traffic engineering and efficient sensor network protocols prior to joining georgia tech he received a masters in computer engineering from the university of massachusetts amherst usa and a bachelors in electrical engineering from the national institute of technology jaipur india
