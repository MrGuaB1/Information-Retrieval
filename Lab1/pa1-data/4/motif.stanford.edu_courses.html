the brutlag bioinformatics group courses courses biochemistry 118q genomics and bioinformatics this course is a sophomore seminar series and only open to sophomores and freshmen in this seminar we will discuss the kind of knowledge we hope to gain from sequencing human genomes and the implications of such knowledge for medicine and biomedical research we will discuss novel diagnoses and treatment of diseases including stem cells gene therapy and rational drug design we will discuss personal genomics and how it can be used to improve health and well being we will also discuss the social and ethical implications of genetic information such as privacy discrimination and insurability biochemistry 158 258 genomics bioinformatics and medicine lecture based course for juniors and seniors and 258 for graduate and medical students covers same material as biochem 118q this course covers the molecular basis of inherited disease we will discuss both simple mendelian diseases and complex multifactorial diseases we will discuss genomics functional genomics epigenetics gene expression snps copy number and other structural genomic variations involved in disease in addition to these diagnostic approaches we will discuss novel therapeutic methods such as stem cell therapy gene therapy and drug developments that depend on the knowledge of genomics we will discuss personal genomics pharmacogenomics and clinical genomics and their role in the future of preventive medicine courses for stanford and scpd biochemistry 218 medical information sciences 231 computational molecular biology computational molecular biology biochem 218 is a practical hands on approach to the field of computational molecular biology the course is recommended for both molecular biologists and computer scientists desiring to understand the major issues concerning representation and analysis of genomes sequences and proteins various existing methods will be critically described and the strengths and limitations of each will be discussed there will be practical assignments utilizing the tools described while no computer experience or programming skills are required prior exposure to personal computers e mail and the internet are essential all homework and coursework must be submitted electronically prerequisites include an introductory molecular biology course at the level of biology 41 or permission of the instructor students who have not had a course in molecular biology may acquire the necessary background by reading either stryer's biochemistry 5th edition by berg tymoczko and stryer or lewin's genes ix this course is also available to industry students through stanford center for professional development scpd course syllabus http biochem218 stanford edu bio 84 your genes and your health a stanford continuing studies adult education course on personal genomics analyzing your dna can reveal a lot about your potential health and future well being although knowledge of your genetic frailties may suggest a predisposition to a disease genetics alone does not seal your fate most common diseases are affected by your behavior and your environment changing one's lifestyle can alleviate or even prevent disease hence understanding genetic indicators can alert one to the importance of being vigilant about lifestyle and medical follow ups in this course we will empower you with tools to learn more about diseases treatments and genetic tests that will help you to understand any genetic disease the instructor will use data from his own genome to show you how you can look into your ancestry family relationships inherited diseases and response to drugs you will see how knowing one's genetic profile can lead to reduced health care costs and a new approach to a confident healthy lifestyle certificates computational genomics certificate program genomics is the study of the organization function and evolution of genetic material at the level of the whole genome rather than individual genes modern methods of sequencing and analyzing whole genomes leads to the need to store model and understand genomic data using computational methods topics include pairwise and multiple sequence alignment sequence analysis and annotation snp's microarray analysis modeling and visualization of genetic data controlled vocabularies ontologies for biological data the impact of genomics on health care including diagnostics and therapeutic applications relevant related links links to biomedical informatics courses link to all bioinformatics & bioengineering online programs at scpd link to the new bioinformatics & computational genomics certificate program disclaimer for use of these web resources
