probabilistic relevance feedback next up previous contents index next when does relevance feedback up relevance feedback and pseudo previous the rocchio71 algorithm contents index probabilistic relevance feedback rather than reweighting the query in a vector space if a user has told us some relevant and nonrelevant documents then we can proceed to build a one way of doing this is with a naive bayes probabilistic model if is a boolean indicator variable expressing the relevance of a document then we can estimate the probability of a term appearing in a document depending on whether it is relevant or not as 50 51 where is the total number of documents is the number that contain is the set of known relevant documents and is the subset of this set containing even though the set of known relevant documents is a perhaps small subset of the true set of relevant documents if we assume that the set of relevant documents is a small subset of the set of all documents then the estimates given above will be reasonable this gives a basis for another way of changing the query term weights we will discuss such probabilistic approaches more in chapters 11 13 and in particular outline the application to relevance feedback in section 11.3 4 page for the moment observe that using just equation 50 as a basis for term weighting is likely insufficient the equations use only collection statistics and information about the term distribution within the documents judged relevant they preserve no memory of the original query next up previous contents index next when does relevance feedback up relevance feedback and pseudo previous the rocchio71 algorithm contents index 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
