stanford pnrl optical burst mode components home projects publications members contact us high speed optical burst mode transceiver general pon system in access network project summary burst mode transmission at high bit rates is challenging due to the lack of suitable optical burst mode transceivers high performance burst mode optical transceiver is still a subject of intensive research this project will investigate the feasibility of and the technologies for high speed optical burst mode transceivers and design high performance integrated circuits for burst mode laser driver and clock and data recovery this project will include module and ic chip design and the research will be mainly based on circuit design simulations ic fabrication and verification experiments the module design will break down the transceiver into different functional parts which can be implemented with integrated circuits and identifies which part can use conventional continuous mode ic and which part needs to be designed to support burst mode operation for continuous mode ics it is possible that commercial available high speed ics can be used for burst mode ics high speed operation is a challenging task which will be the focus of this research burst mode transmission path current progress this project was started in fall 06 and we are still investigating the best solution for optical burst mode transceiver the burst mode cdr ic was manufactured by former ph d student of pnrl independently of this project 1.25 gbit s burst mode clock data recovery sponsor cis center for integrated systems partnership between stanford university and industrial firms researchers pis professor leonid kazovsky students jinwoo cho ledcho at stanford dot edu wei tao shaw pnrl wtshaw at stanford dot edu publications and presentations none yet home projects contact us stanford ee last updated 1 19 2009
