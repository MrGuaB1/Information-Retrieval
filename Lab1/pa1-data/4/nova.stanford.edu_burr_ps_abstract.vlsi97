papers tfl vlsi97 abstract 4 mar 9 1997 cmos energetics and applications this tutorial will discuss the fundamental relationships between energy and performance in digital cmos systems it will show how cmos technology can be optimized to substantially reduce power consumption and improve performance if the threshold voltage is set close to zero volts and electrically tuned according to the level of activity and to compensate for process and environmental variations it will also describe some real world application examples that have been implemented using this approach topics to be covered include energy and activity performance models leakage and noise threshold variations tunability and worst case performance low voltage circuit styles experimental data applications and future prospects applications will include digital signal processing motion estimation high end microprocessors and embedded microcontrollers
