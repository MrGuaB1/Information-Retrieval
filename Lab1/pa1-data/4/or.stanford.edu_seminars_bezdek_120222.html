axiomatic attribution for multilinear functions on foams with convex cells each containing a unit ball karoly bezdek computational & discrete geometry professor centre for computational & discrete geometry pure mathematics university of calgary wednesdayday february 22 2011 4 30 5 30 pm y2e2 room 101 abstract we raise and investigate the following problem if the euclidean 3 space is partitioned into convex cells each containing a unit ball how should the shapes of the cells be designed to minimize the average surface area of the cells this problem leads to a strong version of the kepler conjecture on densest sphere packings as well as to a new relative of kelvin foam problem the talk is of a survey type operations research colloquia http or stanford edu oras_seminars html
