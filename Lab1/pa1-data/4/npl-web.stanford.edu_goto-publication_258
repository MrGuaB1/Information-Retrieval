fabrication and characterization of lead sulfide thin films by atomic layer deposition ecs transactions 16 29 2008 fabrication and characterization of lead sulfide thin films by atomic layer deposition ecs transactions 16 29 2008 neil p dasgupta stephen p walch friedrich prinz abstract we present a study of the deposition of lead sulfide pbs thin films by atomic layer deposition ald pbs films were deposited from pb tmhd 2 and h2s precursors at precursor sublimation temperatures of 165 175 c the film growth rate was 1.3 1.8 a cycle which is higher than previously published values a linear growth rate characteristic of ald was observed with no chemical contamination film properties are studied using xps xrd sem and afm measurements afm images show that the films are polycrystalline with grain size increasing with film thickness calculations have been performed using density functional theory dft to model the reaction mechanism
