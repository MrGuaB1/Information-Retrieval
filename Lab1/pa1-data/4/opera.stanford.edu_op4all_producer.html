message from ira ross operaglass opera for everyone a message from ira ross the producer of the series for me opera is life this is my reason for producing the series opera for everyone i love all of opera the music the drama the singers the orchestra the sets and scenery the costumes the lighting everything i say this not as a performer but as a member of the audience as one who listens and watches and feels the enchantment and excitement of the whole show my purpose in this series is to present opera in a way that will help others feel the fire as i do this is done by first presenting a short background of the opera and then by telling the story in two ways first with words and then with music for each of the major episodes in addition i suggest what to listen for in the music the series is designed for everyone the newcomer to opera as well as the veteran opera goer it may even entice some to enter the world of opera for the first time therefore almost all the terms used in this series are in everyday usage if technical terms are used not very often they are explained opera for everyone is an introduction to the opera the series is not an end in itself i suggest that these compact discs be listened to before watching the opera live on video or on television after viewing the performance listen to the disc again to relive and fortify the experience this same suggestion applies when listening to the opera on compact disc or on radio the listener may even discover that opera for everyone is an exciting experience in itself without attending the opera my hope is that this series will help you feel as well as see and hear some of the treasures of the wonderful world of opera opera for everyone operaglass home page 31 dec 2004
