martinez group photoinduced cis trans isomerization of ethylene using the aims method we have investigated the short time dynamics of ethylene following ultrafast excitation from the ground electronic state to the singly excited state the simulations show that the photodynamics of ethylene involves both covalent and ionic electronic states and that the return to the ground electronic state proceeds through a pyramidalized geometry snapshots of the p and p like natural orbitals of an individual basis function traveling on the excited electronic state of ethylene the arrows drawn on the energy levels to the left of the orbital indicate the occupation of each orbital the calculation begins at a planar geometry where the excited state wavefunction has covalent pp character during the course of the dynamics the excited state wavefunction oscillates between covalent 50 150 and 200 fs and ionic 110 170 280 and 350 fs forms attempts at hydrogen migration are observed for both ionic and covalent wavefunctions snapshots at 200 and 280 fs the predicted excited state lifetime of 180 femtoseconds is in general agreement with the expectation of sub picosecond dynamics since accessing the conical intersections requires a substantial distortion along the pyramidalization angle of one of the methylene groups from the twisted geometry the excited state population does not begin to decay appreciably until 50 femtoseconds has elapsed after the electronic excitation the excited state population of ethylene as a function of time in fs blue line quenching to the ground electronic state begins 50fs after the electronic excitation and a gaussian fit to the aims data red line predicts an excited state lifetime of 180fs
