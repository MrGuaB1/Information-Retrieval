dynel application 1 effect of fault surface morphology on sliding regim and slip distribution numerical experiments consist in sliding a rectangular object along a fixed one so that one edge of each object stay in contact with one edge of the other fig 1 the relative displacement between the two sliding surfaces is calculated for different stages fig 2 we also compute the obsolute motion through time of several points along the interfaces as well as the stresses in order to characterize the interactions between asperities during displacement fig 3 figure 1 a model configuration and b surface morphology model 1 has a regular surface morphology sinusoidal and model 2 has an irregular surface morphology points a and b are the points used to analyze the slip regime for model 1 and 2 respectively figure 2 computed slip distribution and stress perturbation for dx 0.12 and dx 0.32 there is a relationship between anomalies in slip lows and stress concentration a a regular surface morphology see animation model 1 has many contact points so the slip anomalies and stress concentrations less important b slip anomalies and stress concentrations are enhanced when the surface morphology is irregular see animation model 2 with few contact points figure 3 slip regime for a the sinusoidal morphology models 1 and b the irregular morphology model 2 one single point is analyzed through time for each model see figure 1 for location of points a and b of model 1 and 2 respectively there is a stress increase where the points are blocked along a positive asperity the slip is then reduced with a decreasing dx stick regime there is a stress drop as soon as the point passes the top of the asperity the point slips as seen by the increasing dx slip regime the second order stick slips are a mesh effect when two points are in contact copyright the stanford rock fracture project 2002
