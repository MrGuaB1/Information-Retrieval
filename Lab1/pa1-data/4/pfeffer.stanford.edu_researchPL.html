pfeffer lab biochemistry dept stanford university pfeffer lab stanford university biochemistry dept copyright 2012 all rights reserved we are interested in understanding the molecular basis by which receptors are transported between membrane compartments in human cells rab gtpases are master regulators of these events they catalyze transport vesicle formation as well as vesicle motility docking and fusion the human genome encodes 70 rabs and we are interested in learning how they localize to different compartments how they are regulated and how they interact with specific effector proteins to drive membrane traffic current work focuses on transport vesicle tethering at the golgi mediated by a long coiled coil protein called gcc185 1 2 and a rho gtpase family member rhobtb3 that is actually an atpase 3 gcc185 is anchored to membranes by two molecules of arl1 gtpase and two molecules of rab6 with tim fenn and axel brunger we solved the structure of this complex 1 we are working to understand how gcc185 captures vesicles at the golgi prior to membrane fusion 2 we are also studying the niemann pick type c npc 1 protein that when mutated leads to disease npc1 patients suffer the consequences of excess cholesterol and sphingolipid accumulation in endosomes and lysosomes we seek to determine the precise role of npc1 in cholesterol regulation and have just discovered that npc2 binds to npc1 protein to transfer cholesterol from the lumen of lysosomes to the limiting membrane of that compartment 4
