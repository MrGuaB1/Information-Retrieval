pagerank next up previous contents index next markov chains up link analysis previous anchor text and the contents index pagerank we now focus on scoring and ranking measures derived from the link structure alone our first technique for link analysis assigns to every node in the web graph a numerical score between 0 and 1 known as its pagerank the pagerank of a node will depend on the link structure of the web graph given a query a web search engine computes a composite score for each web page that combines hundreds of features such as cosine similarity section 6.3 and term proximity section 7.2 2 together with the pagerank score this composite score developed using the methods of section 15.4 1 is used to provide a ranked list of results for the query consider a random surfer who begins at a web page a node of the web graph and executes a random walk on the web as follows at each time step the surfer proceeds from his current page a to a randomly chosen web page that a hyperlinks to figure 21.1 shows the surfer at a node a out of which there are three hyperlinks to nodes b c and d the surfer proceeds at the next time step to one of these three nodes with equal probabilities 1 3 figure 21.1 the random surfer at node a proceeds with probability 1 3 to each of b c and d as the surfer proceeds in this random walk from node to node he visits some nodes more often than others intuitively these are nodes with many links coming in from other frequently visited nodes the idea behind pagerank is that pages visited more often in this walk are more important what if the current location of the surfer the node a has no out links to address this we introduce an additional operation for our random surfer the teleport operation in the teleport operation the surfer jumps from a node to any other node in the web graph this could happen because he types an address into the url bar of his browser the destination of a teleport operation is modeled as being chosen uniformly at random from all web pages in other words if is the total number of nodes in the web graph the teleport operation takes the surfer to each node with probability the surfer would also teleport to his present position with probability in assigning a pagerank score to each node of the web graph we use the teleport operation in two ways 1 when at a node with no out links the surfer invokes the teleport operation 2 at any node that has outgoing links the surfer invokes the teleport operation with probability and the standard random walk follow an out link chosen uniformly at random as in figure 21.1 with probability where is a fixed parameter chosen in advance typically might be 0.1 in section 21.2 1 we will use the theory of markov chains to argue that when the surfer follows this combined process random walk plus teleport he visits each node of the web graph a fixed fraction of the time that depends on 1 the structure of the web graph and 2 the value of we call this value the pagerank of and will show how to compute this value in section 21.2 2 subsections markov chains definition the pagerank computation topic specific pagerank next up previous contents index next markov chains up link analysis previous anchor text and the contents index 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
