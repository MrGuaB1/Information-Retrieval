powernet powernet a magnifying glass for computing systems energy home power data comments about check out our sensys 10 demo what is powernet data from the department of energy suggests that computing equipment in office and education buildings accounts for about 1.5 of all electricity consumption in the united states unfortunately it is difficult to understand exactly how this energy is distributed among different devices and user tasks the powernet project aims to characterize the energy consumption of enterprise style computing infrastructures this includes user machines as well as networking and storage equipment fine grained power consumption data correlated with device utilization can highlight opportunities for reducing the energy costs of everyday computing currently a hybrid network of power meters is monitoring 138 devices consuming 9463 watthours this amount accounts for 2.1 of the total electricity consumption of the gates computer science building at stanford where is electricity going the extensive power measurements that powernet provides result in a breakdown of electricity consumption the graph below shows how different device classes contribute to the overall energy bill
