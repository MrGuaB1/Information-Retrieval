operaglass death in venice the richter scale death in venice by benjamin britten presented by san francisco opera at the war memorial opera house 301 van ness ave san francisco ca conducted by donald runnicles directed by lotfi mansouri reviewed by judy richter the san francisco opera is staging what it considers its first production of benjamin britten's death in venice the company did stage it in 1975 and 1979 as part of its spring opera season at the curran theatre but this is the work's first appearance at the war memorial opera house britten based his libretto on thomas mann's novella of the same name it is the story of a successful german writer gustav von aschenbach facing his 50s and a creative crisis as he ponders his belief in order rather than passion in order to work through his crisis and perhaps find inspiration he decides to go to venice there he becomes obsessed with a 12 year old polish boy tadzio so great is his obsession that even when he learns of a cholera epidemic he can t bring himself to leave britten's writing lacks flowing melody rather he uses wide jumps and dissonances in his vocal lines the lusher sounds and much of the musical drama lie with the orchestra conductor donald runnicles the company's music director elicits all of the tonal color from his fine orchestra for a thrilling performance in addition to the writing part of the reason why the vocal line seems less accessible is that american tenor kenneth riegel who plays von aschenbach has a somewhat grainy voice he seems to capture the character's emotions in his acting but his singing is less gratifying on the other hand italian baritone alfonso antoniozzi who plays seven different characters that von aschenbach encounters has a wonderfully fluid voice matched by fluid movements even though the production is sung in english supertitles are necessary riegel's diction is not sharp and antoniozzi has an italian accent the importance of supertitles was quite apparent during the sept 17 performance when they weren t working for the first five minutes or so riegel was almost impossible to understand as was antoniozzi interestingly they were much more understandable once the supertitles began working again despite riegel's shortcomings the production works well in a number of ways stage director lotfi mansouri the company's general director stages the action intelligently allowing it to flow naturally wolfram skalicki's set design makes liberal use of rear projections to allow rapid scene changes he frames the set in reflective material that creates some interesting effects as tadzio and his friends all dancers play on the beach which is upstage and lower hence the audience sees much of that action reflected overhead at an angle costume designer susan benson has created handsome turn of the century garb for the large cast and michael whitfield's lighting enhances the visual effect as well as the drama the pivotal role of tadzio is a non singing part played by a dancer christopher newnam though newnam is a fine dancer and has the ethereal look that would captivate aschenbach he looks and is much older than 12 however it would be difficult to find a 12 year old boy who has the dance skills that newnam brings to the role the production is choreographed by michael smuin who is the former artistic director of the san francisco ballet and who now has his own dance company in san francisco smuin has a theatrical flair that he uses well here supporting roles are ably filled by countertenor michael chance as the offstage voice of apollo bass baritone david okerlund as a travel agent members of the sfo chorus in a variety of roles and others although a great deal of creative effort and talent has gone into this production it needs a stronger aschenbach to succeed fully especially since it doesn t allow the audience to sit back and enjoy the beautiful music as it would with more familiar works by the likes of mozart verdi and puccini nevertheless it's laudable a work that deserves to be seen again when the right singers are available for more information see the san francisco opera home page operaglass main page monday 08 dec 2003 21 44 37 pst
