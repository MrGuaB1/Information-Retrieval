operaglass review un ballo in maschera the richter scale un ballo in maschera by giuseppe verdi presented by san francisco opera at the war memorial opera house 301 van ness ave san francisco ca conducted by marco armiliato directed by gina lapinski reviewed by judy richter there's no doubt that deborah voigt is among today's leading operatic divas with her vocal power impeccable control throughout her wide register and clarion tonality the dramatic soprano also is an expressive singer actress who clearly conveys the emotions of her character in this case it's amelia anckarstrom in the san francisco opera production of giuseppe verdi's un ballo in maschera the admirably slimmed down voigt clearly shows her character's conflicting emotions for amelia is the wife of count anckarstrom baritone ambrogio maestri but in love with the swedish king gustavus iii tenor marcus haddock ironically anckarstrom is the king's closest most loyal adviser so both amelia and the king are torn between fidelity and passion haddock who has a true but relatively light voice also does a good job of conveying the king's feelings and maestri is solid as anckarstrom the other principals though not superstars like longtime sfo favorite voigt are nevertheless impressive including mezzo soprano tichina vaughn as madame arvidson a fortune teller soprano anna christy as oscar the king's page and bassos joshua bloom as count ribbing and jeremy galyon as count horn conspirators plotting against the king christy is noteworthy for her crystalline coloratura as well as her energetic stage presence the production ably directed by gina lapinski works well dramatically but conductor marco armiliato sometimes seems at odds with the singers rather than staying with them and trying to keep the otherwise excellent orchestra from overpowering them ian robertson's sfo chorus both men and women makes solid contributions the handsome costumes highlighted by those at the masquerade ball in the final scene are by john conklin the dramatic lighting by marie barrett and the choreography by lawrence pech the sets were originally created for the washington national opera sfo presents un ballo with just one intermission consolidating acts 2 and 3 with just a short interlude to change the set for more information see the san francisco opera home page operaglass main page 18 sep 2006
