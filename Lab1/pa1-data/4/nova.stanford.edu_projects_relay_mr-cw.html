mr cw power and frequency the mr beacon cw power is plotted versus time in this figure the gain in our direction during the normal 100 minute spacecraft spin was at maximum just before 16 00 utc on november 25 1996 the spacecraft began instrument calibrations at 16 18 16.3 hours in the figure and the calibrations continued through 17 40 17.7 hours during this time the moc camera was swept first past the earth and then the moon the mr gain in our direction was again quite large at these times this figure was obtained using our low volume archive of thresholded data and should be considered preliminary the mr beacon frequency is plotted versus time above the frequency of the peak signal in each of our spectra is indicated with a post processing will allow us to better estimate the received mr beacon frequency as a function of time the frequency changes smoothly with time due primarily to doppler shifts caused by the earth's rotation this figure was obtained using our low volume archive of thresholded data and should be considered preliminary our frequency resolution for the processing of the mr beacon signal was approximately 7.5 hertz last updated 02 december 1996 joe twicken
