dictionary as a string next up previous contents index next blocked storage up dictionary compression previous dictionary compression contents index dictionary as a string the simplest data structure for the dictionary is to sort the vocabulary lexicographically and store it in an array of fixed width entries as shown in figure 5.3 assuming a unicode representation we allocate we allocate 20 bytes for the term itself because few terms have more than twenty characters in english 4 bytes for its document frequency and 4 bytes for the pointer to its postings list four byte pointers resolve a 4 gigabytes gb address space for large collections like the web we need to allocate more bytes per pointer we look up terms in the array by binary search for reuters rcv1 we need for storing the dictionary in this scheme dictionary as a string storage pointers mark the end of the preceding term and the beginning of the next for example the first three terms in this example are systile syzygetic and syzygial using fixed width entries for terms is clearly wasteful the average length of a term in english is about eight characters icompresstb1 so on average we are wasting twelve characters or 24 bytes in the fixed width scheme also we have no way of storing terms with more than twenty characters like hydrochlorofluorocarbons and supercalifragilisticexpialidocious we can overcome these shortcomings by storing the dictionary terms as one long string of characters as shown in figure 5.4 the pointer to the next term is also used to demarcate the end of the current term as before we locate terms in the data structure by way of binary search in the now smaller table this scheme saves us 60 compared to fixed width storage 24 bytes on average of the 40 bytes 12 bytes on average of the 20 bytes we allocated for terms before however we now also need to store term pointers the term pointers resolve positions so they need to be bits or 3 bytes long in this new scheme we need for the reuters rcv1 dictionary 4 bytes each for frequency and postings pointer 3 bytes for the term pointer and bytes on average for the term so we have reduced the space requirements by one third from 19.211 2 to 10.87 6 mb blocked storage with four terms per block the first block consists of systile syzygetic syzygial and syzygy with lengths of seven nine eight and six characters respectively each term is preceded by a byte encoding its length that indicates how many bytes to skip to reach subsequent terms next up previous contents index next blocked storage up dictionary compression previous dictionary compression contents index 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
