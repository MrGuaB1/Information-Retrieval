the prp with retrieval costs next up previous contents index next the binary independence model up the probability ranking principle previous the 1 0 loss case contents index the prp with retrieval costs suppose instead that we assume a model of retrieval costs let be the cost of not retrieving a relevant document and the cost of retrieval of a nonrelevant document then the probability ranking principle says that if for a specific document and for all documents not yet retrieved 62 then is the next document to be retrieved such a model gives a formal framework where we can model differential costs of false positives and false negatives and even system performance issues at the modeling stage rather than simply at the evaluation stage as we did in section 8.6 page however we will not further consider loss utility models in this chapter 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
