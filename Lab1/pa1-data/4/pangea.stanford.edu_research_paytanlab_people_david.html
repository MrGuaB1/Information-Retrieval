david nicolson david roo nicolson ms 2003 graduate student at university of washington alkaline phosphatase activity in seawater an enzyme tracer for phosphate utilization roo2atudotwashingtondotedu biography roo hails from eugene oregon he earned both a bachelor's degree and a coterminal master's degree from stanford project description alkaline phosphatase is the most widely used enzyme that marine organisms use to hydrolize organic p compounds to biologically available orthophosphate phosphorus is an essential nutrient utilized by all living organisms and has been recognized as a limiting nutrient in some oceanic systems accordingly it is expected that in areas where p is a limiting nutrient organisms will produce and release more ap to seawater so they can utilize the dissolved and particulate organic p compounds the objective of this work is to assess the utility of alkaline phosphatase activity in seawater as an indicator of the degree of p limitation and to evaluate the causes for differences in the activity as well as the degree of spatial and temporal variability in p status roo's project examined ap activity in san francisco and monterey bays using both standard enzyme assay methods to measure bulk community activity and a cell specific enzyme labeled fluorescent elf method in order to determine cell specific variations in ap activity
