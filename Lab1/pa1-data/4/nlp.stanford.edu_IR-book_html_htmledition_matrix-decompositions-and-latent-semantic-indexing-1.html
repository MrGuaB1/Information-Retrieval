matrix decompositions and latent semantic indexing next up previous contents index next linear algebra review up irbook previous exercises contents index matrix decompositions and latent semantic indexing on page 6.3 1 we introduced the notion of a term document matrix an matrix each of whose rows represents a term and each of whose columns represents a document in the collection even for a collection of modest size the term document matrix is likely to have several tens of thousands of rows and columns in section 18.1 1 we first develop a class of operations from linear algebra known as matrix decomposition in section 18.2 we use a special form of matrix decomposition to construct a low rank approximation to the term document matrix in section 18.3 we examine the application of such low rank approximations to indexing and retrieving documents a technique referred to as latent semantic indexing while latent semantic indexing has not been established as a significant force in scoring and ranking for information retrieval it remains an intriguing approach to clustering in a number of domains including for collections of text documents section 16.6 page 16.6 understanding its full potential remains an area of active research readers who do not require a refresher on linear algebra may skip section 18.1 although example 18.1 is especially recommended as it highlights a property of eigenvalues that we exploit later in the chapter subsections linear algebra review matrix decompositions term document matrices and singular value decompositions low rank approximations latent semantic indexing references and further reading next up previous contents index next linear algebra review up irbook previous exercises contents index 2008 cambridge university press this is an automatically generated page in case of formatting errors you may want to look at the pdf edition of the book 2009 04 07
