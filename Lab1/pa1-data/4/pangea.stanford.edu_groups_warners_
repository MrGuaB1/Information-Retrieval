warner range surprise valley project home stanford university school of earth sciences home seismic geology connections outreach publications introduction the warner range lies in the northeastern corner of california near the oregon and nevada borders see yellow box in figure 1 mt shasta sits approximately 100 miles to the west orange circle in figure 1 and is visible from the top of the range the surprise valley adjacent to the steep eastern flank of the range hosts the town of cedarville geologically the warner range marks a border between two provinces with very different histories the basin and range to the east and the modoc plateau to the west because of this unqiue geological setting we are interested in learning more about the structure of the crust in this area and how that structure has changed through time the stanford project in the warner range surprise valley region consists of three major components a high resolution seismic reflection line across the surprise valley geologic mapping in the warner range and surprise valley connections with others working in the region figure 1 relief map of northern california with major roads addressing these components requires collaboration across disciplines resulting in the involvement of people from two departments within the stanford school of earth sciences geophysics and geological and environmental sciences lead faculty students and staff on the project are simon klemperer professor geophysics elizabeth miller professor geological and environmental sciences anne egger undergraduate program coordinator geological and environmental sciences joe colgan graduate student geological and environmental sciences now usgs derek lerch graduate student geological and environmental sciences now feather river college our work in this region is ongoing and this web site serves as a means to inform our students and collaborators of our progress funding for the warner range surprise valley project has come from several sources petroleum research fund of the american chemical society grant 39063 ac8 to elizabeth miller nsf divison of tectonics grant ear 0229854 to elizabeth miller nsf division of geosciences earthscope grant 0346245 to simon klemperer and elizabeth miller nsf division of engineering geoenvironmental engineering and geohazard mitigation grant 0444696 to simon klemperer and kenneth stokoe university of texas austin stanford university vice provost for undergraduate education grants to simon klemperer elizabeth miller and the ges department stanford university school of earth sciences please contact anne egger if you have any questions
