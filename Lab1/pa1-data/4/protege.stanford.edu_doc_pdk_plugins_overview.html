protege developer documentation an introduction to developing plug ins home overview documentation downloads support community wiki about us users developers an introduction to developing plug ins a plug in is an extension to protege there are six types of plug ins tab widget a user interface tab that appears in the main protege window alongside system tabs such as the classes tab an example of a tab widget plug in is the queries tab slot widget appears on a form and is used to view and acquire a value for a slot at an instance an example of a slot widget plug in is the textfieldwidget used for acquiring and displaying strings back end specifies the mechanism that protege will use for storage either as text or in a database an example of a back end plug in is the rdf back end createproject takes a file in a source format produced by another program and creates the closest possible natural protege knowledge base export provides an extensible mechanism for exporting protege knowledge bases in a variety of formats both file and database this plug in types is related to back end plug ins but is much easier to develop and serves a somewhat different need project allows manipulation of a protege project and protege's project ui there are several steps that are common to the development of each of the protege plug in types which are described below specific information required by the different plug in types is described elsewhere the process for developing a plug in consists of the following broad steps develop a skeletal plug in before you can develop the code specific to your plug in you need to generate a stub plug in with the desired name but with trivial functionality and then get it to load into protege and show up in the appropriate places to do this subclass the appropriate class for your plug in type implement all the methods required to do something simple generate a manifest file with an appropriate entry for your plug in although you need a manifest file for protege to see and use your plug in it is not necessary to package your plug in as a jar file while it is being developed protege can load and run a plug in that consists only of class files in a directory flesh out the plug in once your skeletal plug in shows up you can begin to flesh it out by developing the code specific to your plug in for tab or slot widget plug ins this will involve generating java swing components assembling them and laying them out for back end plug ins this will mean writing or interfacing with a existing parser or database see the documentation for each plug in type for more information package and distribute the plug in once you have developed and tested your plug in you may wish to package it so that others can use it we recommend that at the point that you give your plug in to your first user you package your plug in as a jar file attempting to distribute a plug in as a collection of class files is an error prone and frustrating process for both developers and users to create a jar file from your class files and your manifest file use the standard java jar command for your users to install a plug in they just need to place the jar file in the plugins subdirectory of the protege installation directory after you package your plug in as a jar file you will need to retest it before you distribute it there are several problems unrelated to protege that arise which can cause a plug in packaged as a jar file to behave differently from a plug in accessed as class files home overview documentation downloads support community wiki about us protege is a national resource for biomedical ontologies and knowledge bases supported by the national library of medicine protege is a core component of the national center for biomedical ontology copyright 2012 stanford center for biomedical informatics research valid xhtml 1.0 valid css
