untitled document earth science research review poster session award first position karim farhat ms student in ere karim farhat poster poster title co2 interim storage potentials in energy hybridization and co2 eor operations abstract & background in the absence of legislations that impose price on co2 emissions no significant economic incentive currently exist for large scale commercial application of co2 capture and storage ccs a novel technique currently under development shows high potentials to add value on sequestered co2 promote its utilization and bridge the gap between its supply and demand thus allowing the development of fully integrated and reliable co2 market this technique is referred to as co2 interim storage or briefly cis a cis involves storing co2 for a definite period of time to be subsequently utilized in co2 eor and potentially other industrial processes in this project a case study is conducted in which cis is implemented to meet the co2 demand for eor operations in the state of wyoming this is achieved via modeling an integrated source sink co2 network in addition the flow of co2 in underground storage reservoirs is numerically simulated to provide general analysis of the technical aspects associated with varying co2 injection and extraction rates 2
