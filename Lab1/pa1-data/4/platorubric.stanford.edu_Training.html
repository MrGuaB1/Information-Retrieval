plato training home the plato elements training research people resources training for reliability why the more samples of instruction one can record for a teacher the more reliable the data collected in an analysis of a pilot study we found that at least six class periods with a minimum of two plato entries per period were needed to get a stable score on all thirteen elements the six observations are done over three days of instruction with two class periods being observed each day per teacher for the highest level of reliability it is important that the three days of observation are not in a row two days could be sequential but the final observation should be at least 1 2 weeks later this allows for a more complete picture of the kinds of instruction and content covered in class how to achieve reliable and accurate scoring all observers must complete a training program the training allows the research team to review in detail each element and its components and to highlight what one should be looking for in the classroom before using the plato protocol all observers are required to reach reliability on the tool reliability requires observers to score correctly on 80 of their scores on observations of at least five samples of english language arts instruction reliability should also be retested in the field by having two observers attend the same class and both complete the plato protocol follow up training and testing may be required depending on the length of the study to request training on the plato tool please contact pam grossman stanford university irepp school of education contact 2009 stanford university terms of use copyright
