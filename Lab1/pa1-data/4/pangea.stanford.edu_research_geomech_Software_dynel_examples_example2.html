dynel example 2 quartz grain crushing here we propose a simple example made with eight round grains fig 1 this aggregate is subject to uniaxial vertical loading applied through constant forces acting on the two bounding platens in the second principal direction perpendicular to the loading and horizontal on the sketch the grains are free ie they can move as much as necessary to accommodate the compression without breaking an iterative procedure allows us to present the space evolution of each grain and its internal stress field evolution see animation this indicates that the stress field is not constant and evolves with time in respect to grain contact number and the geometry of those contacts the maximum stress difference is located along the grain contact lines the magnitude of stress difference is not identical for all contact lines and for all grains contact lines more closely aligned with the loading direction seem to show a higher stress difference figure 1 eight rounded grains subjected to uniaxial loading spatial and temporal evolution of the quartz grains the stress difference plotted within each grain allows to evaluate the contact number as the main parameter controlling the stress field within a grain model from xavier du bernard rochy copyright the stanford rock fracture project 2002
