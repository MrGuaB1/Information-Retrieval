question classification using latent focus words question classification using latent focus words presented by anand iyer ritvik mudur motivation motivation question answering systems are slowly becoming more prevalent web search yahoo answers forums question classification is an integral part of any qa system classify each question into a pre defined set of classes fine and coarse limits the range of data corpora to be searched makes the problem tractable in many cases question focus words qfws word or phrase indicating the main focus of the question excluding the interrogative words example hum ind who was the first person to reach the north pole focus word person commonly found using heuristics templates what which type kind relative of head word of first np vp in the question can also learn the focus word with a set of labeled gold qfws latent qfws we could also consider the focus words as latent or hidden before training use a gradient descent approach to find the focus words that result in the most confident and accurate classifications on our training set results compared to a baseline system that used only heuristics for qfw selection used a perceptron classifier begin with a single random initialization begin with an ensemble of 20 random initializations using a voting system in the first iteration conclusion comparable results many more avenues to explore different training approaches multiple qfws space of latent qfws hybrid approach heuristics latent focus words exploits ambiguity scales easier to more specific classes new heuristics can be tedious to introduce to more data do not require gold focus words questions acknowledgements thank you mihai surdeanu for your guidance and support
