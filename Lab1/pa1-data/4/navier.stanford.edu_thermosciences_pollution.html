htgl pollution sciences research projects in pollution technology kinetics no x removal pollution kinetics this program comprises several experimental studies of the chemical reaction mechanisms for formation and removal of no x a major pollutant in combustion processes studies are carried out using shock wave heating to prepare the gaseous samples and laser diagnostics to probe the temporal evolution of critical species in addition we are studying reactions of hnco a compound that can be injected into flue gases to remove no x after treatment methods for no x removal from combustion products this project is focused on investigation of various chemical processes for removal of no x from combustion gases by the injection of nitrogen containing additives these additives imitate a gas phase reaction sequence that converts no x to n 2 of particular interest is the performance of the process at elevated pressures such as found in gas turbines and diesel engines a list of current and recent projects in pollution sciences along with the name of the faculty and ph d students involved is given here the last item is the name of the sponsor prof tom bowman schmidt chad and kemal abid reduction of no x and co emission from naval powerplants onr prof ron hanson furlong edward diode laser sensor system for real time in situ monitoring and control onr serdp mihalcea radu muliplexed diode laser sensor system for simultaneous measurements of co no co 2 and no 2 serdp afosr webber michael diode laser sensor system for real time in situ monitoring and control onr serdp back to research topics page maintained by perry thoorsell last updated august 17 2005
