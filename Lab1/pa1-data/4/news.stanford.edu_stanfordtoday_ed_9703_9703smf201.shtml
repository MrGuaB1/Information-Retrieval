breast cancer gene isolated science and medicine breast cancer gene isolated the knockout strategy esearchers have isolated a key gene involved in human breast cancer the first to be found that is not necessarily linked to familial breast cancer the new gene known as tsg101 also is the first identified through an innovative strategy called random homozygous knockout rhko devised by professor of genetics dr stanley n cohen and postdoctoral fellow dr limin li dr limin li and dr stanley n cohen using the new method scientists can simultaneously inactivate or knock out both copies of a gene in a cell without knowing the gene's identity or function then they look among millions of these mutant cells for individual cells that are capable of forming cancers by identifying the gene inactivated in the cancer forming cells researchers can isolate genes called tumor suppressors which normally are necessary to stop cancer development in this case the knockout strategy enabled the researchers to isolate a defective gene in breast cancers that weren t necessarily familial this is significant because the vast majority of breast cancers arise through cancer gene plain text cancer gene adobe acrobat format 261k previous next mar apr 1997 in this issue departments president's column news on campus religion at stanford campus digest sci & med fruit flies cancer gene tuna implants sci & med digest sports brains versus brawn sports digest features gravity probe b social dance class of 2000 hanna house home guest services searching st collection news service alumni email the editor coming up
