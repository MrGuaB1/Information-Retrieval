cegelski lab research home research people publications outreach contact links our research program integrates chemistry biology and physics to investigate the assembly and function of macromolecular and whole cell systems the genomics and proteomics revolutions have been enormously successful in generating full genome sequences for an increasing number of organisms and in predicting and determining the structures of a steadily increasing number of proteins in essence these data provide crucial parts lists for biological systems yet formidable challenges exist in generating complete descriptions of how the parts function and assemble into macromolecular complexes and whole cell factories we are inspired by the need for novel and unconventional approaches to solve these outstanding problems in biology our approach is different from the conventional protein structure determinations of standard structural biology we employ biophysical and biochemical tools and are designing new strategies using solid state nmr spectroscopy to examine assemblies such as amyloid fibers bacterial cell walls and biofilms and biomass in general we would like to understand at a molecular and atomic level how bacteria self assemble fascinating extracellular structures including functional amyloid fibers and how bacteria use these building blocks to construct organized biofilm architectures we are also engaged in identifying small molecules to interfere with these processes and in understanding the modes of action of newly discovered antibiotics and anti virulence compounds key words major interests biophysical chemistry solid state nmr spectroscopy macromolecular structural biology chemical biology microbiology cell walls biomass biofilms
