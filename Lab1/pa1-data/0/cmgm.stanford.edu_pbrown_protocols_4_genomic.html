genomic dna labeling protocol developed for microarray based comparative genomic hybridization genomic dna can be labeled with a simple random priming protocol based on gibco brl's bioprime dna labeling kit though nick translation protocols work too i routinely use the bioprime labeling kit gibco brl as a convenient and inexpensive source of random octamers reaction buffer and high concentration klenow do not use the dntp mix provided in the kit though other sources of random primers and high concentration klenow work as well 1 add 2 ug dna of the sample to be labeled to an eppindorf tube note for high complexity dnas eg human genomic dna the labeling reaction works more efficiently if the fragment size of the dna is first reduced i routinely accomplish this by restriction enzyme digestion usually dpnii though other 4 cutters work as well after digestion the dna should be cleaned up by phenol chloroform extraction etoh precipitation qiagen pcr purification kit also works well 2 add ddh 2 0 or te 8.0 to bring the total volume to 21 ul then add 20 ul of 2.5 x random primer reaction buffer mix boil 5 min then place on ice 2.5 x random primer reaction buffer mix 125 mm tris 6.8 12.5 mm mgcl 2 25 mm 2 mercaptoethanol 750 ug ml random octamers 3 on ice add 5 ul 10x dntp mix 10x dntp mix 1.2 mm each datp dgtp and dttp 0.6 mm dctp 10 mm tris 8.0 1mm edta 4 add 3 ul cy5 dctp or cy3 dctp amersham 1 mm stocks note cy dctp and cy dutp work equally well if using cy dutp adjust 10x dntp mix accordingly 5 add 1 ul klenow fragment note high concentration klenow 40 50 units ul available through neb or gibco brl as part of the bioprime labeling kit produces better labeling 6 incubate 37 degrees c for 1 to 2 hours then stop reaction by adding 5 ul 0.5 m edta ph8 0 7 as with rna probes i purify the dna probe using a microcon 30 filter amicon millipore add 450 ul te 7.4 to the stopped labeling reaction lay onto microcon 30 filter spin 10 min at 8000g 10000 rpm in microcentrifuge invert and spin 1 min 8000g to recover purified probe to new tube 20 40 ul volume 8 for two color array hybridizations combine purified probes cy5 and cy3 labeled probes in new eppindorf tube then add 30 50 ug human cot 1 dna gibco brl 1 mg ml stock blocks hybridization to repetitive dnas if present on array 100 ug yeast trna gibco brl make a 5 mg ml stock blocks non specific dna hybridization 20 ug poly da poly dt sigma catalog no p9764 make a 5 mg ml stock blocks hybridization to polya tails of cdna array elements 450 ul te 7.4 concentrate with a microcon 30 filter as above 8000g 15 min then check volume every 1 min until appropriate collect probe mixture in a volume of 12 ul or less 9 adjust volume of probe mixture to 12 ul with ddh 2 0 then add 2.55 ul 20x ssc for a final conc of 3.4 x and 0.45 ul 10 sds for a final conc of 0.3 note the final volume of hybridization is 15 ul this volume is appropriate for hybridization under a 22 mm2 coverslip volumes should be adjusted upwards accordingly for larger arrays coverslips 10 denature hybridization mixture 100 c 1.5 min incubate for 30 minutes at 37 c cot 1 preannealing step then hybridize to the array 11 hybridize microarray at 65 c overnight 16 20 hrs note see human array hybridization protocol for details on hybridization 12 wash arrays as with mrna labeling protocol and scan first wash 2x ssc 0.03 sds 5 min 65 c second wash 1x ssc 5 min rt third wash 0.2 x ssc 5 min rt note the first washing step should be performed at 65 c this appears to significantly increase the specific to non specific hybridization signal if you have any questions comments or improvements please pass them along to jonathan r pollack md ph d howard hughes medical institute beckman center b251 stanford medical center stanford ca 94305 5323 e mail jpollack cmgm stanford edu
