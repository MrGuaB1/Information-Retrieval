tay sachs disease page 1 i tay sachs disease genomics and medicine alison keiper page 2 about tay sachs i autosomal recessive i progressive neurodegenerative disorder i in the most severe cases it's fatal by age 2 or 3 i caused by a mutation in both alleles of a gene on chromosome 15 page 3 the tay sachs gene i this gene codes for an enzyme found in lysosomes an organelle in eukaryotic cells that breaks down large molecules into its components that can be recycled by the cell i this specific enzyme in the lysosome is absent or at extremely low inefficient levels in tay sachs individuals i leads to an accumulation of gangliosides a lipid in neurons i the progression of tay sachs is directly related to the amount of accumulation of gangliosides page 4 lipid accumulation page 5 diagnosing tay sachs i characterized by developmental retardation in infants i followed by paralysis dementia blindness and eventually death i cherry red spot surrounded by a gray white area i blood test to detect a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme page 6 progress being made i since the causative gene is known prenatal screening was established in the 1970s i targeted towards ashkenazi jews because it's most prevalent among them i has led to a 90 reduction of tay sachs page 7 treatment tactics 1 prevent or slow the production of gangliosides i reduce them to a level that the deficient enzymes can handle i studies inconclusive still ongoing 1 normal genes are delivered to the brain to increase the breakdown of gangliosides i delayed the onset of the disease i decreased inflammation of neurons i improved function i extended their life page 8 late onset tay sachs i unfortunately there are no treatments for late onset tay sachs i ganglioside synthesis inhibitor shows promise i the effectiveness is limited in infants because it's unknown how much irreversible damage occurs before birth
