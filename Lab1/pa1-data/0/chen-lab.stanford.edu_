chen lab home overview of chen lab research the long term goal of our research is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie synapse function during behavior in the developing and mature brain and how synapse function is altered during mental retardation in this broad research area we are specifically interested in the molecular underpinnings of activity dependent regulation of synaptic strength the role of postsynaptic protein translation in plastic changes of synaptic activity and the impairment of synapses in autism spectrum disorders eg fragile x syndrome that involves changes in postsynaptic protein translation and synaptic strength
