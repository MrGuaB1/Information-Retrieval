compressed gases laboratory chemical safety toolkit home compressed gases click here for the general use standard operating procedure for compressed gases summary the risks associated with the use of laboratory chemicals must be well understood prior to their use in an experiment as many chemicals have multiple hazards ensure to review the safety guidance for all hazard classes that may apply definition per cal osha 8 ccr 5191 a compressed gas is defined as a gas or mixture of gases having in a container an absolute pressure exceeding 40 psi at 70 f 21.1 c or a gas or mixture of gases having in a container an absolute pressure exceeding 104 psi at 130 f 54.4 c regardless of the pressure at 70 f 21.1 c or a liquid having a vapor pressure exceeding 40 psi at 100 f 37.8 c as determined by astm d 323 72 characteristics compressed gases have inherent pressure hazards and can also create health hazardous and or flammable atmospheres common hazard characteristics of gases include flammability toxicity and corrosivity a few gases ie silane diborane phosphine are considered pyrophoric will ignite spontaneously in air one additional hazard property common to all compressed gases is the substantial volume expansion when released to air gas release in an inadequately ventilated room can create an oxygen deficient environment examples non liquefied compressed gases nitrogen argon helium oxygen hydrogen liquefied compressed gases chlorine carbon dioxide nitrous oxide dichlorane hydrogen bromide compressed gases in solution acetylene cryogenic liquefied gases nitrogen argon helium oxygen hydrogen information on toxic gases for additional information on gases classified as toxic gases and management responsibilities go to http www stanford edu dept ehs prod researchlab lab tgo index html back to top search content content introduction getting started your responsibilities pi laboratory supervisor laboratory personnel safety training prior approval and special precautions medical surveillance safe lab practices creating standard operating procedures lab safety basics fume hood use personal protective equipment chemical storage labeling & inventory restricted chemicals & high risk procedures laboratory inspections chemical waste disposal emergencies spills or exposures emergencies spills or exposures health threatening non health threatening small spills local clean up incident reporting reference info chemical hazard classes carcinogens compressed gases corrosive materials cryogenic liquids flammable and combustible liquids highly acutely toxic chemicals highly reactive unstable materials irritants reproductive toxins sensitizers restricted chemicals laboratory chemical safety sheets material safety data sheets stanford lab safety sheets toxnet 2007 stanford university all rights reserved
