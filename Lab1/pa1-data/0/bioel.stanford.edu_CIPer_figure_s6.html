connector inversion probe s6 sgtc bioelectrical and pathogen detection ciper supplemental information s6 supplemental information figure s6 table s1 previous figure figure back to abstract figure s6 multiplex multiplexing padlocks mmp construct assembly for ciper probes production the extended ciper carries a third universal segment and flanks the barcode together with the other universal segments the probe is divided and synthesized in three constructs with the middle one containing the barcode through a two way ligation scheme the three fragments can be joined into a full length probe following the grid like assembly strategy displayed in the figure one genotype detection pair of as es constructs is combined with multiple unique barcodes the unique barcode now carries two dimensions of information ie genotype and patient id post reaction cipers can be combined into multiple patient pools and all screened simultaneously essentially lowering costs involved with downstream validations both for hybridization based techniques and sequencing procedures corresponding author nader pourmand pourmand at stanford dot edu sgtc webmaster 2007 stanford genome technology center last modified xhtml css section 508
