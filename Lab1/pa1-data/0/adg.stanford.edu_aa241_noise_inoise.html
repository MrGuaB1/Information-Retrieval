noise calculation notes noise limit shown is cumulative stage 4 requirement noisereduction input is engine noise relative to reference engine at maximum thrust in db reference engine is a bypass ratio 6 engine that produces 25000 lb thrust and 101 pndb at 1000ft more recent engines with improved acoustic treatment might generate 5db less with similar bypass ratios while lower bypass ratio engines might yield 3db more noise than the baseline ie noisereduction 5 db is reasonable for aircraft in 2006 note that the thrust required to maintain the 3 degree approach glide slope depends on approach speed which is a function of landing flap angle remember to check flapdeflection landing take off and landing flap and slat deflections affect noise and performance at many points
