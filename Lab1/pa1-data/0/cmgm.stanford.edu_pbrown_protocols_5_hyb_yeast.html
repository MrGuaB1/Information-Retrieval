hybridization of arrays hybridization of arrays last updated august 10 1999 materials qty order info 100c heat block 1 65c water bath 1 hybridization chamber 1 per array custom made by monterey industries or purchased at corning costar 2551 cover slip 22 mm x 22 mm 1 per array 3x ssc 10 ul per array 10 sds 1 ml fine tip forceps 1 slide rack 2 tba each rack holds 8 slides slide chamber 3 tba each chamber holds 200 ml ddh2o 600 ml 20x ssc 13 ml directions for fluorescent dna probes 1 final probe volume should be 12 15ul at 4x ssc containing competitor dna etc as required eg polyda cot1 dna for a human cdna array 2 set up array in hybridization chamber place 10 ul 3x ssc on edge of slide to provide humidity 3 add 0.3 ul 10 sds to probe 4 boil probe for 2 min set aside several cover slips for next step 5 pipet probe onto array avoiding bubbles using forceps to help immediately lay down 22mm x 22mm cover slip over array avoiding bubbles it is worth practicing this step several times with 10 ul water and a blank microscope slide 6 close hybridization chamber and submerge in 65c water bath 7 hybridize 4 24 hr 8 prepare wash solutions 1 1x ssc 0.03 sds 2 0.2 x ssc and 3 0.05 x ssc wash 1 wash 2 wash 3 dh2o 190 198 200 20x ssc 10 2 0.5 10 sds 0.6 final vol 200 ml 200 ml 200 ml 9 pour wash solutions in slide chambers and place slide racks in washes 1 & 2 10 disassemble hybridization chamber and quickly submerge array in wash 1 if the array is exposed to air while the cover slip starts to fall off you may see high background fluorescent signal on the side of the array 11 let the array sit in wash 1 until the cover slip slides off gently plunge slide rack up and down several times to wash the array be sure not to scratch the array with the loose cover slip 9 manually transfer array to slide rack in wash 2 and rinse 2nd time 10 move slide rack to wash 3 and rinse 3rd time it is critical to remove all sds 11 centrifuge slides on microtiter plate carriers place paper towels below rack to absorb liquid for 5 min 500 rpm 12 scan array immediately notes be aware of cy5 bleaching during scanning we have found that arrays scanned immediately and two days after hybridization give nearly identical data using genepix 4000a scanner
