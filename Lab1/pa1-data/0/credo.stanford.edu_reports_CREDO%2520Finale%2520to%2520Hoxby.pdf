credo finale to hoxby's revised memorandum page 1 credo finale to hoxby's revised memorandum page 2 on october 9 2009 caroline hoxby replaced her original memo a serious statistical mistake in the credo study of charter schools with a new version titled simply a statistical mistake in the credo study of charter schools the title page includes the statement this is a somewhat longer version of the august 2009 version of this memo it adds additional equations to help readers follow the statistical proofs a few other notes have also been added few readers will miss the fact that the amplified proof is markedly different from the original and reaches somewhat different conclusions a different proof was needed given that the previous one was shown to be both mistaken and unfounded 1 the new proof is also incorrect though it comes closer to reflecting the approach that credo uses this memo demonstrates conclusively that the theoretical problem hypothesized by dr hoxby does not exist in our data thus settling this abstract issue with facts rather than speculation dr hoxby asserts that the virtual control record must introduce bias into the estimation of the effect of charter schooling on student achievement due to larger measurement error in the prior achievement of charter school students we demonstrate below that the means and variances of prior achievement are identical for charter students and control students in the vcrs appendix a provides the results of t tests for differences in prior achievement named z state_t0 for the first period records of charter school students and their vcr matches the overall results are reading math mean standard error mean standard error vcr match 0327747 0012930 0911137 0012946 charter school students 0328184 0012949 0914350 0012969 in both math and reading the distributions are symmetrical and the t tests provide no support for dr hoxby's fundamental premise we also tested the distributions for each state independently and the results were the same these results hold for both the unconditional distributions of prior achievement and for the distributions after conditioning on each of the additional explanatory variables in credo's statistical analyses in fact the credo vcr method is a viable methodology for matching students that mitigates several of the concerns that dr hoxby raises concerning the use of administrative datasets the credo analysis produces a valid picture of the distribution of charter school performance while not as favorable to charter schools many would have liked including credo the results provide a basis for the necessary discussion regarding the causes of the observed variation in charter school quality and the pros and cons of the available policy options for improvement 1 credo fact vs fiction an analysis of dr hoxby's misrepresentation of credo's research october 7 2009 page 3 credo appreciates all efforts to substantively improve our analytical methods but the methodological issues raised by dr hoxby have been fully addressed and it is now time to return to substantive policy discussions page 4 appendix a starting score t tests for reading and math note the following t tests are performed on the starting score z_state_t0 for period 1 matched students so this is the score on which the students were matched overall for read two sample t test with equal variances group obs mean std err std dev 95 conf interval tps 529170 0327747 001293 9405509 0353088 0302405 charter 529170 0328184 0012949 9419374 0353563 0302805 combined 1058340 0327965 0009149 941244 0345898 0310033 diff 0000437 0018299 0035428 0036302 diff mean tps mean charter t 0.0239 ho diff 0 degrees of freedom 1.1 e 06 ha diff 0 ha diff 0 ha diff 0 pr t t 0.5095 pr t t 0.9809 pr t t 0.4905 page 5 overall for math two sample t test with equal variances group obs mean std err std dev 95 conf interval tps 529177 0911137 0012946 9417248 093651 0885764 charter 529177 0914350 0012969 9434122 0939769 0888932 combined 1058354 0912744 0009162 9425684 0930701 0894786 diff 0003214 0018324 0032702 0039129 diff mean tps mean charter t 0.1754 ho diff 0 degrees of freedom 1.1 e 06 ha diff 0 ha diff 0 ha diff 0 pr t t 0.5696 pr t t 0.8608 pr t t 0.4304
