genomics & medicine biochemistry 118 sophomore seminar genomics & medicine doug brutlag seminar description in this seminar we will discuss the kind of knowledge we hope to gain from sequencing human genomes and the implications of such knowledge for medicine and biomedical research we will discuss novel diagnoses and treatment of diseases including stem cells gene therapy and rational drug design we will discuss personal genomics and how it can be used to improve health and well being we will also discuss the social and ethical implications of genetic information such as privacy discrimination and insurability the course will be of interest to students who plan to major in biology or human biology especially premedical students and biology majors who use molecular biology methods it will also be useful to those interested in health care policy intellectual property rights and ethical issues homework will include using genome and disease databases to determine the function of genes involved in disease there are no prerequisites for this course recommended text book this textbook is not required for the course but it provides an excellent introduction to the material discussed including basic genetics and genomics used in medicine and research this would be a good reference book for those continuing to work in this field a primer of genome science a primer of genome science by gibson and muse a more elementary introduction to genetics genomics and medicine genetics home reference handbook seminar syllabus diseases and disease databases genomics bioinformatics snps and cnvs in the human genome genome wide association studies personal genomics stem cell therapies gene expression and cancer diagnostics epigenetics patent policy drug development and pharmacogenomics ethical issues and genetic discrimination bibliographic search projects previously submitted for the seminar 1999 2000 2001 2002 2002 stanford overseas program 2003 2004 2005 2007 2008 2008 autumn 2009 winter 2009 autumn 2010 autumn 2011 winter case presentations 2008 autumn 2009 winter 2009 autumn 2010 autumn 2011 winter cc dlb web page last updated january 10 2012
