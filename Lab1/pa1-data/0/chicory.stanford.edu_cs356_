cs 356 automatic formal verification methods cs 356 automatic formal verification techniques spring quarter 2003 2004 course description this class covers theoretical and practical aspects of computer assisted formal verification of systems emphasis will be on the more practical and more automatic methods especial model checking for finite state system lectures lectures are held every monday and wednesday in gates 100 from 9 30 10 45 am except university holidays the course will be taught by prof david dill handouts handouts including lecture notes will generally be available on the web assignments there will be more or less biweekly homeworks which will be a combination of programming use of verification tools and written problems homeworks will generally be assigned each wednesday and due a week later credit and grading grades will be based on homeworks the project and class participation there will be no exams questions & mailing lists send questions also regarding assignments to cs356 verify stanford edu if everything else fails questions can be directed to david dill dill cs stanford edu tentative schedule this is in a state of flux so don t rely too much on this version except that the topics are approximately right lecture date topic assignment 1 3 31 2004 introduction murphi basics 2 4 5 2004 murphi algorithms symmetry reduction give murphi a try 3 4 7 2004 symmetry reduction hw 1 due 4 14 2004 4 4 12 2004 probabilistic verification 5 4 14 2004 partial order reduction 6 4 19 2004 bdd basics 7 4 21 2004 reachability with bdds hw 1 due hw 2 due 4 28 2004 8 4 26 2004 reachability with bdds 9 4 28 2004 bdds and fsm reachability 10 5 3 2004 ctl model checking hw 2 due hw 3 due 5 10 2004 11 5 5 2004 more ctl model checking fairness constraints 12 5 10 2004 symbolic model checking with fairness constraints 13 5 12 2004 verification and formal languages hw 4 due 5 24 14 5 17 2004 omega automata 15 5 19 2004 omega automata 16 5 24 2004 abstraction & refinement hw 4 due hw 5 due 6 2 2004 17 5 26 2004 cooperating decision procedures 18 6 2 2004 predicate abstraction copyright by david l dill 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 all rights reserved this material may be freely distributed for educational purposes so long as 1 this copyright notice remains 2 modifications and additional material are clearly marked so as to be distinguished from the original material and 3 no fee is charged other uses require the express written consent of the authors there are probably errors use at your own risk
