contralign conditional training for protein sequence alignment contra lign con ditional tra ining for protein sequence alignment home contralign contrafold contrast description server download faq links questions what is the goal of the contra project what is the most accurate alignment tool is contralign appropriate for my sequences is there a version of contralign for aligning dna sequences how do i cite contralign what is the goal of the contra project the aim of the contra project is to better understand discriminatively trained probabilistic models of sequences known as conditional random fields or crfs and their application to a variety of problems in computational biology more specifically most current applications of probabilistic sequence models in computational biology use generative probabilistic models such as hidden markov models hmms and stochastic probabilistic context free grammars scfgs pcfgs generative models treat sequences as the result of simulating stochastic process in hmms the stochastic process involves transitioning from one state of a finite state automaton to the next in scfgs pcfgs the stochastic process involves randomly picking the next production rule to apply to the current partial parse tree while generative models are intuitive and allow convenient parameter training via maximum joint likelihood techniques they also make many strong assumptions regarding the stochastic nature of the data they attempt to fit in the contra project we consider the application of discriminative probabilistic models an alternative to generative models to various problems in computational biology for which generative models have previously been proposed unlike generative models discriminative models are trained by maximizing conditional likelihood ie con ditional tra ining by applying discriminative techniques to these problems we hope to gain an understanding of when generative or discriminative techniques are appropriate for a given problem learn about the biology of the processes we model by examining the model estimated by the learning algorithm and provide a sound mathematical foundation for new tools which deal with problems in computational biology return to top what is the most accurate alignment tool unsurprisingly the best alignment tool will depend on the situation in our cross validation tests contralign gives statistically significant advantages in pairwise alignment accuracy on average compared to other current tools however for any particular alignment task any of a number of different alignment tools see links page may perform the best for particular alignment situations other alignment algorithms may be better for instance when using an alignment to identify a small region of local similarity within two long sequences you re best off using a local alignment tool contralign is fundamentally a global aligner in general no matter which tool you use be cautious about trusting an alignment reported by any automatic alignment program especially when the sequences have low 30 percent identity return to top is contralign appropriate for my sequences contralign should do as well as any other aligner in most pairwise alignment situations contralign is based on a global alignment model so if you think your sequence may have a local alignment try using the double affine gap scoring option with contralign return to top is there a version of contralign for aligning dna sequences currently there is not parameter learning in contralign relies on the existence of a training set of gold standard alignments while structural methods are used to obtain gold standard protein sequence alignments currently no equivalent procedure exists for dna sequences we eventually plan to incorporate the unsupervised learning methods used in probcons for nucleotide sequence alignment preliminary tests of this strategy using the bralibase 2 rna alignment benchmark database show that such an approach holds much promise for developing high accuracy alignment algorithms without reference data return to top how do i cite contralign please cite do cb gross ss and batzoglou s 2006 contralign discriminative training for protein sequence alignment in proceedings of the tenth annual international conference on computational molecular biology recomb 2006 pdf ps gz return to top site design by chuong do artwork by marina sirota comments questions send us feedback
