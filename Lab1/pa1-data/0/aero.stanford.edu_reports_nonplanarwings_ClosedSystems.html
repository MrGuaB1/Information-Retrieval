nonplanar wings closed systems examples closed systems the aerodynamics of nonplanar wing systems that form closed loops are very interesting such configurations include box planes ring wings joined wings and spiroid tip devices wings that form closed loops such as the ring wing illustrated below do not eliminate the tip vortices or trailing vortex wakes even though the wing has no tips still the vortex drag of the circular ring wing is just 50 that of a planar wing with the same span and total lift and the concept has been studied at several organizations including early aviation pioneers a major aircraft manufacturer as well as several toy companies the lockheed box plane shown below achieves even greater drag reduction at a given span and height than the circular ring wing in fact the theoretical minimum vortex drag in a configuration with reasonable high speed performance note the desirable transonic area ruling and some structural advantages fuel volume landing gear integration cl max penalties and lower section reynolds numbers are some of the disadvantages for this concept early attempts at ring wing design were just as ambitious and successful the figure below is the bleriot iii the recently patented spiroid wing tip produces a reduction in induced drag much like that of a winglet however its closed planform shape may make it possible to reduce local lift coefficientsnoften a problem for winglets although a closed lifting system may eliminate the wing tips it does not eliminate the trailing vortex wake in fact the lift produced by the system can be directly related to the velocities in the wake that lead to induced drag these systems are still interesting because one may add a constant circulation vortex ring to the system without changing the wake such a constant strength vortex distribution does not add any lift but it may be used to produce moments without induced drag penalties or to manipulate section lift coefficients in a desirable way
