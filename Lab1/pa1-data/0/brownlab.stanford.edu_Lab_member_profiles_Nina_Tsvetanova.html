nina tsvetanova research focus in the past studies of gene expression have focused on transcription and the regulatory networks comprised of interactions among promoters transcription factors and enhancers however evidence from the last decade shows that mrna levels are often a poor predictor of protein production and suggests that post transcriptional processing and regulation play an important role in gene expression specific rna binding proteins rbps not only regulate and carry out transcription pre mrna processing export localization translation and decay but also serve to interconnect the steps of the rna lifecycle the goal of this project is two fold first we want to develop and optimize an integrated approach consisting of in vitro and in vivo assays that will enable the large scale identification of rbps binding to a selected set of mrnas such an optimized experimental approach would be of great value for studying the post transcriptional regulation of any mrna of interest second using the optimized experimental approach we hope to be able to obtain temporal resolution of rna regulation we want to examine the protein factors that are bound to a specific mrna and regulate its transcriptional elongation pre mrna modification export and translation the results obtained through such investigation would show if copies of the same transcript are regulated as parts of multiple mrna protein complexes mrnps as suggested by several studies and if such combinatorial regulation happens sequentially or simultaneously also the study would elucidate if mrnas involved in the same or similar biological processes are regulated by the same sets of rbps further a thorough and temporal study of rna regulation would provide a comprehensive list of the rbps that couple the different steps of the rna lifecycle and help gain a more complete understanding of the mrnp system elements and the interactions among these elements on a large as well as temporal scale brown lab publications tsvetanova ng klass dm salzman j brown po 2010 proteome wide search reveals unexpected rna binding proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae plos one 5 e12671 email nina1984 stanford edu phone 650 728 5998 address 279 w campus drive dept of biochemistry beckman center room b403 stanford ca 94305 birthdate 7 1 1984 education ba vassar college poughkeepsie ny 2002 2006 freie universitat berlin germany feb july 2005 major 1 biochemistry major 2 german studies hobbies running tennis hiking dancing thes is project mrna protein complexes temporal regulation and coupling of steps in the mrna life
