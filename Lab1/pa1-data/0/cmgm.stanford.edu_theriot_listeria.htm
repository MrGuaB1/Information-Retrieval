listeriosis listeria monocytogenes and theriot lab research listeria monocytogenes is a small rod shaped gram positive bacterium that is ubiquitous in the environment in the soil on plants and animals listeriosis the state of listeria infection is associated with eating of unpasteurized cheese or dairy products or consumption of contaminated vegetables infection occurs primarily in newborns and infants elderly or immunocompromised individuals or pregnant women mother is asymptomatic or has influenza like syndrome but the newborn can acquire it during birth or infection can cause abortion or premature delivery according to the cdc about 1500 cases are reported in the united states each year mostly in the aforementioned high risk groups listeria enters the host along with infected food most of the bacteria will be killed by acid in the stomach but the surviving bacteria invade the cells of the intestinal tract going from cell to cell and thereby spreading the infection laterally intracellular movement of the bacteria is essential for this lateral infection to occur and listeria has been described to move with a comet tail or like an actin rocket the theriot laboratory is studying how listeria moves within cells and results of this research may someday be used to generate vaccines or other means to prevent infection by listeria currently the only preventive measures are thorough cooking and cleaning of food as well as pasteurization of dairy products treatment of listeriosis primarly depends on antibiotics medical information from medical microbiology & immunology by levinson and jawetz 5th edition further listeria links information on risk dangers and prevention center for disease control faq on listeria and listeriosis information on food borne listeriosis from the the food institute of canada listeriosis faq from the new york city department of health bureau of communicable disease faq on the dangers of listeria from family and consumer sciences ohio state university veterinary science faq on listeria from the pennsylvania state university how to reduce your risk of listeriosis from the journal of the american veterinary medical association animal diseases of public health importance from the journal of emerging infectious diseases cdc the bad bug book listeria chapter these sites are not part of the theriot lab website and we have no control over their content or availability
