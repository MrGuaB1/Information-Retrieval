what is chemical engineering stanford engineering intranet what is chemical engineering chemical engineering is a discipline influencing numerous areas of technology in broad terms chemical engineers are responsible for the conception and design of processes for the purpose of production transformation and transportation of materials this activity begins with experimentation in the laboratory and is followed by implementation of the technology to full scale production the large number of industries which depend on the synthesis and processing of chemicals and materials place the chemical engineer in great demand in addition to traditional examples such as the chemical energy and oil industries opportunities in biotechnology pharmaceuticals electronic device fabrication and environmental engineering are increasing the unique training of the chemical engineer becomes essential in these areas whenever processes involve the chemical or physical transformation of matter for example chemical engineers working in the chemical industry investigate the creation of new polymeric materials with important electrical optical or mechanical properties this requires attention not only to the synthesis of the polymer but also to the flow and forming processes necessary to create a final product in biotechnology chemical engineers have responsibilities in the design of production facilities to use microorganisms and enzymes to synthesize new drugs problems in environmental engineering that engage chemical engineers include the development of processes catalytic converters effluent treatment facilities to minimize the release of or deactivate products harmful to the environment to carry out these activities the chemical engineer requires a complete and quantitative understanding of both the engineering and scientific principles underlying these technological processes this is reflected in the curriculum of the chemical engineering department which includes the study of applied mathematics material and energy balances thermodynamics fluid mechanics energy and mass transfer separations technologies chemical reaction kinetics and reactor design and process design these courses are built on a foundation in the sciences of chemistry physics and biology stanford home engineering home cheme home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved chemical engineering faculty & research research & training centers staff prospective students undergraduate what is chemical engineering undergraduate admissions graduate admissions overview admissions requirements admission faqs curriculum current students alumni giving to cheme contact us
