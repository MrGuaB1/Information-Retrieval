bio x stanford university novel silk scaffolds for pancreatic islet encapsulation fontaine magali pathology barron annelise bioengineering michie sara pathology islet transplantation represents an improved treatment for patients with type i diabetes who have undergone destruction of their pancreatic beta cells this research project will focus on using bioengineering and stem cell technology to develop a novel biocompatible scaffold that will aid in survival and function of transplanted islets the scaffold will be fabricated from fda approved silk and surrounded by nanoporous collagen sheets to minimize immune mediated destruction by the graft recipient furthermore stem cells will be co encapsulated and transplanted with the islets to enhance graft survival and function and provide immune protection in the spirit of biox supported interdisciplinary research this project combines the fontaine lab's expertise in islet cell isolation and transplantation the barron lab's expertise in biomaterial science with the michie's lab's insight into regulation of inflammatory cell trafficking and holds enormous medical potential for developing a new platform of beta cell replacement therapy interdisciplinary initiatives program
