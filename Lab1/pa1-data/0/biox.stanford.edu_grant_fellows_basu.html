bio x stanford university aakash basu applied physics bio x graduate student fellowships 2009 2010 professor zev bryant bioengineering aakash's goal is to understand how molecular motors couple atp hydrolysis to the production of mechanical work in particular he is attempting to understand the mechanochemistry of dna gyrase a type ii topoisomerase that introduces negative supercoils into dna he is developing and using single molecule assays to follow the activity of one motor molecule as a function of solution conditions and mechanical perturbations such as tension and torque through this study he wishes to gain a broad understanding of how chemical reactions are coupled to mechanical movements and the general principles that govern the functioning of molecular motors fellowships
