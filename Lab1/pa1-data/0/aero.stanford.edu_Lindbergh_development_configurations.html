design concepts atlantic navigator design concepts here are some configuration concepts for the atlantic navigator each is sized for a take off weight of about 250 lbs and uses two 4 stroke engines a straight forward twin tractor design with fuel in cenral pod and engine nacelles over wing nacelle installation provides improved prop ground clearance single central wheel possible outriggers lead to simple clean gear arrangement a pusher version of the wing mounted twin with extended central fuselage for both payload and fuel an alternative version might have a thinner empennage to permit closer engine spacing this twin boom arrangment with push pull engines carries fuel in the pod boom the push pull engines are more amenable to idling one engine to improve sfc for much of the flight and also provide better reliability hmmm a twin boom concept with very closely coupled booms so as to minimize engine out yaw another version of a push pull twin boom design a variant of the above that eliminates the clap trap in the back a more recent version of the baseline as of 7 18 96 a simpler version here is yet another version with more carefully sized pod to hold fuel the outer panels and tail have been designed with constant chord to simplify manufacturing all of the fuel is held in the center section while room for payload and systems is provided in the wing bays the chord extension provides additional volume and structural depth while isolating electronics from the engines and fuel much of the center pod wetted area is now buried in the wing 7 19 96 drawings by sj morris and i kroo based on discussions between steve ben and ilan
