stanford biochemistry department stanford university structure function analysis from the outside in long range tertiary contacts in rna exhibit distinct catalytic roles benz moy and herschlag biochemistry august 4 2011 the conserved catalytic core of the tetrahymena group i ribozyme is encircled by peripheral elements we have conducted a detailed structure function study of the five long range tertiary contacts that fasten these distal elements together mutational ablation of each of the tertiary contacts destabilizes the folded ribozyme indicating a role of the peripheral elements in overall stability once folded three of the five tertiary contact mutants exhibit defects in overall catalysis that range from 20 to 100 fold these and the subsequent results indicate that the structural ring of peripheral elements does not act as a unitary element rather individual connections have distinct roles as further revealed by kinetic and thermodynamic dissection of the individual reaction steps ablation of p14 or the metal ion core metal ion core receptor mc mcr destabilizes docking of the sustrate containing p1 helix into tertiary interactions with the ribozyme's conserved core in contrast ablation of the l9 p5 contact weakens binding of the guanosine nucleophile by slowing its association without affecting p1 docking the p13 and tetraloop tetraloop receptor tl tlr mutations had little functional effect and small local structural changes as revealed by hydroxyl radical footprinting whereas the p14 mc mcr and l9 p5 mutants show structural changes distal from the mutation site these changes extended into regions of the catalytic core involved in docking or guanosine binding thus distinct allosteric pathways couple the long range tertiary contacts to functional sites within the conserved core this modular functional specialization may represent a fundamental strategy in rna structure function interrelationships read full publication in vitro centromere and kinetochore assembly on defined chromatin templates guse et al nature august 28 2010 during cell division chromosomes are segregated to nascent daughter cells by attaching to the microtubes of the mitotic spindle through kinetochore kinetochores are assembled on a specialized chromatin domain called the centromere which is characterized by the replacement of nucleosomal histone h3 with the histone h3 variant centromere protein a cenp a cenp a is essential for centromere and kinetochore formation in all eukaryotes but it is unknown how cenp a chromatin directs centromere and kinetochore assembly here we generate synthetic cenp a chromatin that recapitulates the essential steps of centromere and kinetochore assembly in vitro we show that reconstituted cenp a chromatin when added to cell free extracts is sufficient for the assembly of centromeres and kinetochore proteins microtubule binding and stabilization and mitotic checkpoint function using chromatin assembled from histone h3 cenp a chimaeras we demonstrate that the conserved carboxy terminus of cenp a is necessary and sufficient for centromere and kinetochore protein recruitment and function but that the cenp a targeting domain required for new cenp a histone assembly is not these data show that two of the primary requirements for accurate chromosome segregation the assembly of the kinetochore and the propagation of cenp a chromatin are specified by different elements in the cenp a histone our unique cell free system enables complete control and manipulation of the chromatin substrate and thus presents a powerful tool to study centromere and kinetochore assembly read full publication archive publications pubmed link stanford biochemistry department copyright 2010 all rights reserved
