mems is a packaging technology thomas kenny department of mechanical engineering stanford university page 1 mems is a packaging technology thomas kenny department of mechanical engineering stanford university http mems stanford edu page 2 is packaging a barrier to mems insertion cost and development time packaging adds a lot of cost and time to mems products reliability packages can improve reliability lack of standard processes universal foundries all mems devices require custom packages nothing is standard marginal or poor performance better packaging can allow device optimization for performance curing these problems can lead to fast transitions from r d markets mems packaging page 3 we propose integrate packaging into the mems fabrication process develop and optimize designs to overcome package process compromises leverage opportunities that come from a package integrated process for performance improvements avoid all back end custom handling and packaging move back towards conventional chip packaging approaches deliver unique mems capabilities without the usual baggage and with some new features mems is a packaging technology page 4 device package process the encapsulation oxide is removed in a vapor hf etcher developed by bosch prototype installed at stanford and the device is sealed by a second non conformal lto teos and other thick oxide processes being explored page 5 as with fixed temperature tests no evidence for leakage through encapsulation long term stability during temperature cycles from 50c to 80c page 6 mems is a packaging technology conclusions mems devices need packages mems fab approachs include good ways to make packages making mems packages at the same time can lead to many advantages
