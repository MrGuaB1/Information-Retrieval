cegelski lab research home research people publications outreach contact links chemical biology and drug discovery new antibiotics and anti infective strategies are needed as common pathogens such as s aureus and streptococcus species emerge resistant to drugs of last resort solid state nmr spectroscopy has contributed tremendously to our understanding of cell wall architecture in s aureus and the modes of action of potent vancomycin analogues that are effective against methicillin and vancomycin resistant s aureus we remain engaged in efforts using solid state nmr to dissect drug modes of action to drive the discovery of new therapeutics we also have a strong interest in using small molecules in chemical genetic approaches to interrupt and dissect assembly events and cellular processes in bacteria exogenously added small molecules can even serve as probes of biofilm architecture and assembly in the way they were used to study s aureus cell wall biosynthesis multiple methods including afm fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy and solids nmr can provide complementary detail of the complexes we are designing new assays to identify and develop target compounds to influence curli biogenesis and amyloid formation ultimately some small molecules may translate our efforts from the laboratory into new anti amyloid and anti biofilm agents
