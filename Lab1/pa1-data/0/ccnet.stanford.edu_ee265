ee265 welcome to ee265 digital signal processing lab department of electrical engineering stanford university winter 2012 course information lab assignments lab 1 lab 2abc lab 2de lab 3 lab 4ab lab 4c lab 5 course description this course introduces the fundamentals of applied digital signal processing by implementing a wide range of digital signal processing dsp applications on the texas instrument ti tms320c55x dsp processor applications covered include digitization of analog signals fir filtering iir filtering fft fft filtering data and wireless communication real time implementation issues as well as performance tradeoffs and processor algorithm limitations are stressed with the intent that upon completing this lab course you will be able to apply dsp processing to your work projects experiments or any real world application that you may encounter this course can be summarized with the following questions how do you acquire signals and what are the constraints in terms of signal bandwidth processing throughput storage and error tolerance quantization error propagation and aliasing what techniques can you apply to the acquired signals such that the desired effect specification can be achieved what effect does different dsp architecture have on these requirements instructor teresa h meng tas chris de sa cdesa at stanford dot edu chris li chriswli at stanford dot edu secretary trish halloran krokel trish at shasta dot stanford dot edu location lecture y2e2 111 lab session packard 001 time lecture 2 15pm 4 05pm mondays lab session 2 15pm 4 05pm weds due dates homework assignments mondays during lecture lab assignments wednesdays in lab before 5 00pm last modified january 11 2012
