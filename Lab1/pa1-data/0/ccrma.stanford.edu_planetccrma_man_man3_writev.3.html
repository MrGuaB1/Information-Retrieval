writev writev 3 name readv writev read or write data into multiple buffers synopsis include sys uio h int readv int filedes const struct iovec vector size_t count int writev int filedes const struct iovec vector size_t count description the readv function reads count blocks from the file associated with the file descriptor filedes into the multiple buffers described by vec tor the writev function writes at most count blocks described by vector to the file associated with the file descriptor filedes the pointer vector points to a struct iovec defined in sys uio h as struct iovec void iov_base starting address size_t iov_len number of bytes buffers are processed in the order vector 0 vector 1 vec tor count the readv function works just like read 2 except that multiple buffers are filled the writev function works just like write 2 except that multiple buffers are written out return value the readv function returns the number of bytes or 1 on error the writev function returns the number of bytes written errors the readv and writev functions can fail and set errno to the fol lowing values ebadf fd is not a valid file descriptor einval fd is unsuitable for reading for readv or writing for writev efault buf is outside the processes address space eagain non blocking i o had been selected in the open call and read ing or writing could not be done immediately library the results will be undefined and probably not what you want see also read 2 write 2 gnu 1993 04 25 readv 3
