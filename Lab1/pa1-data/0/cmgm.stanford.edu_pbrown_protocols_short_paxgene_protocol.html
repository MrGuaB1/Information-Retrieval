short paxgene protocol short paxgene protocol spin in step 6 increased to 20 min no dnase treatment optional wash after step 12 required 1 centrifuge the paxgene blood rna tube for 10 min at 3000 5000 xg using a swing out rotor note ensure that the blood sample has been incubated in the paxgene blood rna tube for a minimum of 2 h at room temperature in order to achieve complete lysis preheat a water bath or heat block for microcentrifuge tubes to 55 c during first spin we spin at 3750 rpm in a standard table top centrifuge 2 remove the supernatant by decanting or pipetting add 5 ml rnase free water to the pellet and close the tube using a fresh secondary hemogard closure gently decant the supernatant and blot on a paper towel 3 thoroughly resuspend the pellet by vortexing and centrifuge for 10 min at 3000 5000 x g remove and discard the entire supernatant small debris remaining in the supernatant after vortexing but before centrifugation will not affect the procedure note incomplete removal of the supernatant will inhibit lysis and dilute the lysate which will affect the conditions for binding rna to the paxgene membrane pellet does not wash to clear white color will remain brown 4 thoroughly resuspend the pellet in 360 l buffer br1 by vortexing 5 pipet the sample into a 1.5 ml or 2 ml microcentrifuge tube not supplied add 300 l buffer br2 and 40 l proteinase k mix by vortexing and incubate for 10 min at 55 c using a shaker incubator heating block or water bath if a heating block or water bath is used vortex each sample once during the incubation do not allow the temperature of the sample to decrease during vortexing note do not mix buffer br2 and proteinase k together before adding them to the sample 6 centrifuge for 20 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge transfer the supernatant to a fresh 1.5 ml or 2 ml microcentrifuge tube not supplied a minimum g force of 10000 x g is required transfer of small debris remaining in the supernatant after centrifugation at full speed will not affect the procedure 7 add 350 l 95 ethanol mix by vortexing and centrifuge briefly 1 2 s 1000 x g to remove drops from the inside of the tube lid note the length of the centrifugation must not exceed 1 2 s as this may result in pelletting of nucleic acids and reduced yields of total rna use 95 ethanol 100 ethanol often contains benzene bad for arrays 8 apply 700 l sample to the paxgene column sitting in a 2 ml processing tube and centrifuge for 1 min at 3 8000 x g 3 10000 rpm place the paxgene column in a new 2 ml processing tube and discard the old processing tube containing flow through 9 apply the remaining sample to the paxgene column and centrifuge for 1 min at 3 8000 x g 3 10000 rpm place the paxgene column in a new 2 ml processing tube and discard the old processing tube containing flow through we do not perform the optional dnase step 10 apply 700 l buffer br3 to the paxgene column and centrifuge for 1 min at 3 8000 x g 3 10000 rpm place the paxgene column in a new 2 ml processing tube and discard the old processing tube containing flow through 11 apply 500 l buffer br4 to the paxgene column and centrifuge for 1 min at 3 8000 x g 3 10000 rpm place the paxgene column in a new 2 ml processing tube and discard the old processing tube containing flow through note buffer br4 is supplied as a concentrate ensure that ethanol is added to buffer br4 before use see important notes before starting 12 add another 500 l buffer br4 to the paxgene column centrifuge for 3 min at maximum speed to dry the paxgene column membrane after this washing step the silica gel membrane may be light or dark brown in color this does not influence the quality of the rna isolated 13 discard the tube containing the flow through and place the paxgene column in a new 2 ml processing tube not supplied centrifuge for 1 min at full speed do this not optional need to be sure to remove all br4 from sample 14 to elute discard the tube containing the flow through transfer the paxgene column to a 1.5 ml elution tube and pipet 40 l buffer br5 directly onto the paxgene column membrane centrifuge for 1 min at 3 8000 x g 3 10000 rpm it is important to wet the whole membrane with buffer br5 in order to achieve maximum elution efficiency be careful to add br5 to middle of membrane and not to touch membrane with pipet tip 15 repeat the elution step step 14 as described using 40 l buffer br5 16 store samples at 70 c or 80 c we store the purified total rna immediately and denature prior to further manipulation however the official protocol provides the option of denaturing rna at 65 c for 10 minutes before storing at 80 c
