high lift airfoil design high lift airfoil design to produce high lift coefficients we require very negative pressures on the upper surface of the airfoil the limit to this suction may be associated with compressibility effects or may be imposed by the requirement that the boundary layer be capable of negotiating the resulting adverse pressure recovery it may be shown that to maximize lift starting from a specified recovery height and location it is best to keep the boundary layer on the verge of separation such distributions are shown below for a re of 5 million note the difference between laminar and turbulent results the thickest section at re 10 million is 57 thick but of course it will separate suddenly with any angle of attack for maximum airfoil lift the best recovery location is chosen and the airfoil is made very thin so that the lower surface produces maximum lift as well since the upper surface cp is specified increasing thickness only reduces the lower surface pressures well almost if the upper surface cp is more negative than 3.0 the perturbation velocity is greater than freestream which means for a thin section the lower surface flow is upstream this would cause separation and the maximum lift is achieved with an upper surface velocity just over 2u and a bit of thickness to keep the lower surface near stagnation pressure a more detailed discussion of this topic may be found in the section on high lift systems this conclusion described by liebeck is easily derived if stratford's criterion or the laminar boundary layer method of thwaites is used for other turbulent boundary layer criteria the conclusion is not at all obvious and indeed some have suggested kroo and morris that this is not the case
