dosage compensation in drosophila expression of x linked genes one x in males two x's in females is equalized by hypertranscription of the male x salivary gland polytene chromosomes from a male third instar larvae a dna stain b msl 1 stain on the x chromosome current model for the regulation of msl mediated dosage compensation in females where the x to autosome ratio is one the sxl gene is turned on and it functions to repress the translation of msl 2 both msl 2 utrs are important for preventing msl 2 protein expression in females sxl binding sites in the 3 utr are proposed to be a target for translational repression by sxl sxl also functions in females to prevent the removal of a small intron in the 5 utr in the absence of msl 2 protein the other msls are unable to associate with the x chromosomes h4ac16 does not accumulate and the female x's are not hypertranscribed in males where the x to autosome ratio is 0.5 sxl is off in the absence of sxl protein the small intron in the msl 2 5 utr is removed msl 2 protein is expressed and the full complement of msls associates with the male x see fig a b this results in the recruitment of h4ac16 the alteration of chromatin structure and hypertranscription genes rectangles transcripts rounded rectangles the utrs of msl 2 thinner rounded rectangles the retained intron is shaded in female msl 2 rnas the potential sxl binding sites in the 3 utr black vertical lines proteins ovals back to the front page
