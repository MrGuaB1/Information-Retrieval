form factor for lifting surfaces form factor for lifting surfaces the principal cause of increased drag is the increased surface velocity supervelocity due to thickness this may be computed as follows for wing like surfaces consider an infinite swept wing with a perturbation due to thickness of ignoring the reduction in c f due to reynolds number and mach number changes associated with the increased local velocity because this cannot be computed at all well and because c f varies weakly with these k 1 2 du cosl du 2 1 5 cos 2 l 2 now in incompressible flow du c t c even for large t c with t c measured in the normal direction in 2 d subsonic flow du c t c cosl 1 m n 2 0.5 c t c cosl b so k 1 2 c t c cos 2 l b c 2 cos 2 l t c 2 1 5 cos 2 l 2 b 2 the value of k is given in the next figure and compared with other methods and experimental data a value for c of about 1.1 agrees best with the rather scattered data when m cosl 1 there is not a velocity increase due to t c and so we take c 0 form factor calculation this calculator may be used to compute the form factor for a lifting surface t c mach sweep k
