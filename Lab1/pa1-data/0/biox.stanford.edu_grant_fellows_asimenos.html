bio x stanford university george asimenos computer science bio x graduate student fellowships 2005 2006 professor serafim batzoglou computer science graduated 2009 director of science & engineering at dnanexus georgios was developing a next generation whole genome alignment pipeline in order to harvest the enormous wealth of genomic data that is becoming available mainly the 12 drosophila genomes and the impending 20 mammalian genomes he used these alignments to predict putative functional elements based on constraint of evolution the challenge was not only to identify such elements but to understand how they act in the context of specific biological systems he also investigated new high throughput experimental techniques to study predicted elements during development of the drosophila embryo fellowships
