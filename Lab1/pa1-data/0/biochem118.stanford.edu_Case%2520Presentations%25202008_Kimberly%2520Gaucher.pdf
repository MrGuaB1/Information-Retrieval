case study gaucher disease page 1 case study gaucher disease presented by kimberly kreitinger page 2 genetics of gaucher disease recessive autosomal gene mutation in the gba gene gene cannot produce beta glucocerebrosidase which breaks down the fatty substance glucocerebroside buildup of glucocerebroside causes symptoms of gaucher disease page 3 associated symptoms skeletal weakness spleen and liver enlargement sometimes resulting in a protruding abdomen fatty deposit on the eye anemia low platelet count low white blood cell count neurological symptoms type ii and type iii how was gaucher disease recognized diagnosed classically page 4 how was gaucher disease recognized diagnosed classically chemical analysis of the sediment from a 24 hour urine collection detection of gaucher cells or cells where there is an abnormal storage of glucocerebroside measuring the amount of a certain enzyme in white blood cells mri ct or x ray of the skeleton page 5 how was gaucher disease treated classically removal of spleen liver transplant transfusion of blood products for severe anemia and bleeding pain medication for bone problems joint replacement surgery for relief from chronic pain and restoration of function oral bisphosphonates and calcium for osteopenia low bone mineral density page 6 has genetic knowledge of gaucher disease led to new diagnoses genetic testing target groups ashkenazi jews swedes in certain regions and some african tribes prenatal genetic testing when there is a high risk factor page 7 has genetic knowledge of gaucher disease led to new treatments enzyme replacement therapy using recombinant glucocerebrosidase future gene therapy has shown promising results for treating gaucher disease
