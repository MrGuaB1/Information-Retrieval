printing tip gallery this page contains pictures and information regarding the various tip designs we have implemented over the past years material 308l stainless slot cut 010 slotting saw price $200 $400 spot size 100um 250um hand tooled by bill sabala at the stanford meche department this variety of tip was the mainstay of our printing operation for the last two years all of our published arrays 1996 1997 including the yeast genome were printed with this type of tip material 308l stainless slot cut 010 slotting saw price really expensive spot size 100um 250um another sabala special this tip is adjustable via two opposing set screws visibile on the top side this allowed the tip to be opened and closed down at will beautiful work but too labor intensive to produce in quantity material titanium slot cut 0.008 edm wire price unknown provided by n mace spot size big when working with this sort of metal it is difficult to obtain the correct slot geometry narrow at the point material 308l stainless slot cut 0.010 by grinding wheel price $50 spot size unpredictable the steep angle used in this tip made for a very delicate point prone to damage the slot size being large yielded variable results material 308l stainless slot cut edm wire price unknown spot size unpredictable the large cut out of this tip results in totally unpredictable spotting behavior this tip had no chance of working material 308l stainless slot cut 0.008 by laser price unknown spot size unpredictable the slot size being large yielded variable results material 308l stainless slot cut 0.0015 by edm wire price $80 spot size 50um 120um extremely small consistent spots somewhat prone to clogging this tip was revision a made by majer precision slight overburn near the point material 308l stainless slot cut 0.0015 by edm wire price $80 spot size 50um 120um extremely small consistent spots this tip was revision c made by majer precision and features a no spin design requires a special holder material tungsten carbide slot cut 0.001 by edm wire price $100 spot size really small extremely small spots but the tungsten carbide is suseptible to shattering especially at the tip in addition the overburn near the tip causes most of the liquid to stay at the top of the slot instead of near the point material 420 stainless steel slot cut 0.006 by edm wire price $30 spot size 150um 200um a nice tip but very suseptible to rust not a good thing for printing dna resuspended in high salt solution material 308 stainless steel slot cut 0.015 grinding wheel price $30 spot size 150um 200um difficult to reproduce copies with perfectly centered slots the tip ends are bent together after cutting this process is prone to variablity material 308 stainless steel slot cut 0.010 grinding wheel price $30 spot size 150um 200um shallow angle of this tip resulted in messy spotting characteristics material 308 stainless steel slot cut 0.015 grinding wheel price $30 spot size 200um 250um difficult to make centered slots steep angle and variable bending cause unpredictable behavior material 308 stainless steel slot cut 0.001 edm wire price $90 spot size 75um 150um beautiful tip made by die tech semiconductor tooling excellent spot size and consistency difficult to clean but worth the effort
