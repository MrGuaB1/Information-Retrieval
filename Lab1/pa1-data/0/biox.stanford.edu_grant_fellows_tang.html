bio x stanford university grace tang bio x bioengineering graduate fellow 2008 professor russ altman bioengineering genetics in recent years technological advancements have enabled the creation of structural genomics initiatives worldwide the collective aim is to increase the structural knowledge of proteins and to achieve a thorough coverage of protein structure space target selection is therefore focused on proteins with low sequence homology to existing structures however this has come at the cost of an increasing number of structures with unknown function traditional methods for functional inference are unreliable at low sequence homology grace aims to use machine learning algorithms in combination with molecular dynamics to detect local three dimensional patterns for functional inference fellowships
