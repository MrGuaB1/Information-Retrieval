airfoil design airfoil design outline of this chapter the chapter is divided into several sections the first of these consist of an introduction to airfoils some history and basic ideas the latter sections deal with simple results that relate the airfoil geometry to its basic aerodynamic characteristics the latter sections deal with the process of airfoil design history and development airfoil geometry pressure distributions relation between cp and performance relating geometry and cp design methods and objectives some typical design problems airfoil design program
