bio x stanford university kc huang bioengineering electrical eng biochemistry kchuang stanford edu clark center s325 mailcode 5444 website kc huang is an assistant professor of bioengineering and by courtesy of electrical engineering and of biochemistry the huang group employs diverse interdisciplinary methods of inquiry to understand the relationships among cell shape detection determination and maintenance in bacteria cell shape plays a critical role in regulating many physiological functions yet little is known about how the wide variety of cell shapes are determined and maintained inside the cell many proteins organize and segregate but how they detect and respond to the cellular morphology to end up at the right place at the right time is also largely mysterious we utilize a combination of analytical computational and experimental approaches to probe physical mechanisms of shape related self organization in protein networks membranes and the cell wall current topics of interest are i cell wall biosynthesis ii the regulation and mechanics of cell division iii membrane organization and iv membrane mediated protein interactions ultimately the manipulation of cell shape may provide a direct tool for engineering complex cellular behaviors faculty
