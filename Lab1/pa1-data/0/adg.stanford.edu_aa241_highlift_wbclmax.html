wing body maximum cl wing body maximum cl the program computes wing c lmax using the methods described in this chapter and based on data for the current wing and fuselage before running this program be sure that you have entered the wing and fuselage geometry parameters on pages such as the wing analysis page airfoil design page and the fuselage layout pages alternatively an entire input set may be entered in the data summary page of the appendix the plot shows the variation in c lmax with flap deflection with a slat deflection of 0 deg and 20 deg
