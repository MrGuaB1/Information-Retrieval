research of paul berg paul berg email pberg cmgm stanford edu web no lab page a dominant theme of research in my laboratory during the past ten years has been the development and application of recombinant dna and related methodologies for the analysis of genetic recombination in eukaryotic cells an important goal in cell and molecular genetics of mammalian cells is to be able to target exogenous genes to specific loci in the genome this has been achieved although the frequency is low our current program aims to discover more about the process of gene conversion a non reciprocal recombination process in which sequences from one duplex dna replace a corresponding region in a homologous duplex dna both in vitro and in vivo experiments are being pursued to explore this reaction particularly the isolation of yeast mutants blocked in their ability to carry out gene conversion between episomal and chromosomal homologous sequences we are exploring this strategy for targeting alterations in chromosomal genes of embryonic stem cells with a goal of creating mutant animals the hiv 1 virus induces an immunodeficiency disease in patients it infects by depleting the t helper population we are exploring the signal transduction pathway from the t cell receptor as a possible target for the action of one of the viral genes jessberger r and berg p 1991 repair of deletions and double strand gaps by homologous recombination in a mammalian in vitro system mol cell biol 11 1 445 457 medline jessberger r podust v hubscher u and berg p 1993 a mammalian protein complex that repairs double strand breaks and deletions by recombination j biol chem 268 20 15070 15079 medline firmenich aa elias arnanz m and berg p 1995 a novel allele of saccharomyces cerevisiae rfa1 that is deficient in recombination and repair and suppressible by rad52 mol cell biol 15 1620 31 medline hays sl firmenich aa and berg p 1995 complex formation in yeast double strand break repair participation of rad51 rad52 rad55 and rad57 proteins proc natl acad sci usa 92 6925 9 medline
