jason casolari i am interested in understanding the large scale localization and organization of mrnas in cells using genomic and biochemical approaches as well as how this impacts gene expression at the translational level the ultimate goal of my work is to obtain a global atlas of mrna localization for varying cells and growth conditions necessitating the development of genome wide approaches that maintain spatial information from the cell and then coupling this with microscopy and biochemical studies of translational regulation to this end i have been working on identifying rnas associated with motor proteins and cytoskeletal structures with the ultimate aim of studying all cellular landmarks eg membranous organelles and other sub cellular structures in addition i am using microscopy to image mrna dynamics in live cells as well as the localization of specific rnas relative to each other in fixed cells in order to assay how mrna and ultimately protein asymmetries are established brown lab publications thompson ma casolari jm badieirostami m brown po moerner we 2010 three dimensional tracking of single mrna particles in s cerevisiae using a double helix point spread function proc natl acad sci usa 107 17864 71 email casolari stanford edu phone 650 725 7569 address 279 w campus drive dept of biochemistry beckman center room b407 stanford ca 94305 birthdate 3 7 1976 education 1998 bs in honors biology university of illinois at urbana champaign 2005 phd in cell and developmental biology lab of pamela a silver phd harvard medical school thesis coupling of transcription and nuclear organization
