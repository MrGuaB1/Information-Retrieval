start butte lab start butte lab trace start butte lab logo introduction to the butte lab the long term research goal of the butte lab is to solve problems relevant to genomic medicine by developing new methodologies in translational bioinformatics first we have developed bioinformatics methods to take genomic genetic phenotypic and rnai data from multiple sources and phenotypes and reason over these data an example of this was in our work in cancer drug discovery published in the proceedings of the national academy of science 2000 on type 2 diabetes mellitus published in the proceedings of the national academy of science 2003 on fat cell formation published in nature cell biology 2005 on obesity in bioinformatics 2007 and in transplantation published in proceedings of the national academy of science 2009 second we have developed tools to automatically index and find genomic data sets based on the phenotypic and contextual details of each experiment our work on automatic annotations of the data in the ncbi gene expression omnibus was published in nature biotechnology 2006 our work in re mapping microarray data was published in nature methods 2007 and our work in deconvolution of whole blood expression was published in nature methods 2010 third we have been developing some novel methods in comparing clinical data from electronic health record systems with gene expression data as described in science 2008 using genetic measurements as described in plos genetics 2010 and using gene expression data as described in molecular systems biology 2009 and described in plos computational biology 2010 and described in the new york times and international herald tribune the butte lab is in the stanford department of pediatrics in the stanford university school of medicine and is a core faculty laboratory in the biomedical informatics training program at stanford university the butte lab also serves as the center for pediatric bioinformatics at lucile packard children's hospital the butte lab is also affiliated with the stanford center for biomedical informatics research formally stanford medical informatics or smi lab news lab people lab photos directions to our lab funding our publications resources and data from publications upcoming presentations post doctoral positions available summer student intern information lab meeting schedule internal lab information login required rotation students start txt last modified 2010 03 22 23 15 by abutte recent changes rss feed donate powered by php valid xhtml 1.0 valid css driven by dokuwiki
