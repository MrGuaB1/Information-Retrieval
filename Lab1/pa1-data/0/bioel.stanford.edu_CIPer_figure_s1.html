connector inversion probe s1 sgtc bioelectrical and pathogen detection ciper supplemental information s1 supplemental information figure s1 next figure back to abstract figure s1 agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide for csp ciper detection limit of hpv 56 in presence of human genomic dna agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide for csp ciper detection limit of hpv 56 in presence of human genomic dna the plasmid concentration was varied ranging from 10 ng to 100 fg per reaction at a constant background of 200 ng non hpv contaminated human genomic dna the minimum detectable amount of hpv observed was 1 pg and the 100 fg mixture showed no significant amplification the upper triangular graph represents a visual interpretation of ciper amplicon intensity as a function of plasmid concentration and the lower graph the background intensity as a function of plasmid concentration corresponding author nader pourmand pourmand at stanford dot edu sgtc webmaster 2007 stanford genome technology center last modified xhtml css section 508
