bio x stanford university bio x flim seminar please join aaron lum ph d and philippe clemenceau and learn more about flim fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy frequency domain flim fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy is a new imaging technique that can provide several full field lifetime images per second compared to time domain approaches frequency domain does not use short pulse lasers and photon counting instrumentation instead it is based on modulated excitation and detection in this seminar a frequency domain technique based on an intensified gated ccd camera combined with modulated light emitting diodes led will be presented its performances and its compatibility with other techniques such as total internal reflection fluorescence tirf will be discussed may 12 2010 10 30am 12 00pm clark s360 fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy seminar with aaron lum and philippe clemenceau please send the following information to bio x_workshops stanford edu to participate in the lecture name department email pi bio x affiliate yes no news & events
