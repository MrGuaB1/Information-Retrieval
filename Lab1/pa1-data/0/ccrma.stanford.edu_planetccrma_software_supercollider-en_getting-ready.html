2 getting ready prev next 2 getting ready supercollider needs a couple of directories in the directory from which it is being started so our first step is to create them so that it can store its stuff there supercollider will not be able to start if it does not find these directories so in a terminal first change your working directory to your home directory and then create a directory tree to hold the supercollider files cd mkdir supercollider cd supercollider mkdir synthdefs mkdir sounds you can select any name for your base directory supercollider in this example and locate it anywhere in the filesystem as long as you name the enclosed directories synthdefs and sounds you will need to be in that base directory when you start supercollider we will be running supercollider from inside emacs the supercollider package comes with a special emacs sclang mode that will let you interact easily with supercollider so start emacs and add this line to the end of your emacs configuration file emacs require sclang save the emacs file and restart emacs in sclang mode emacs sclang emacs will start with two open buffers the bottom one named sclang will report the output of sclang and the top one named scworkspace and labelled supercollider workspace will be the first blank canvas in which you can type supercollider commands prev up next home
