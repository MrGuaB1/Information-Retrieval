alizadehlab meebochip and heebochip open source project meebochip & heebochip information page note this site is mirrored onto the waterdragon server about this project welcome in collaboration with researchers at stanford ucsf stowers institute rockefeller and basel university we designed and built an open source mouse exonic evidence based oligonucleotide chip meebochip and are in the process of building the human counterpart heebochip the set of 70mers for meebochip is already available from illumina inc with synthesis of heebochip 70mers in progress see below for more details to see sample meebo hybridizations from various laboratories click here for a hybridization at stanford by kate rubins click here for a hybridization at ucsf by caroline mrejen click here for a hybridization by emily buck of anita sil's laboratory at ucsf or feel free to contribute your own both arrays are based on a novel selection of exonic long oligonucleotides 70 mers from a genomic annotation of the corresponding complete genome sequences using a transcriptome based annotation of exon structure for each genomic locus using a combination of existing and custom tailored tools and datasets including millions of mrna and est sequences we built and performed a systematic examination of transcript supported exon structure for each genomic locus at the base pair level ie exonic evidence this strategy allowed us to select both constitutive and in many cases alternative exons for nearly every gene in the corresponding genome eg protocadherin locus allowing an unprecedented exploration of human and mouse biology furthermore we used experimentally derived data to hone the selection of these 70mers helping maximize their performance under typical fluorescent labeling and hybridization conditions specifically we applied and refined the arrayoligoselector algorithm from joe derisi's laboratory to select 70mers considering not only their uniqueness ie hybridization specificity within the content of the entire genome but also to overcome the known biases of labeling and hybridization methods eg 3 biased reverse transcription and in vitro transcription reactions finally we have integrated an unprecedented set of control features corresponding to both endogenous mouse human transcripts as well as a diverse array of over 200 spiked doping control rnas within both microarrays these features allow users of these arrays to examine in detail the performance of any given hybridization including assessment of sensitivity specificity dynamic range normalization linearity and to explore various biases for infomation about meebochip please see a description of the meebo content pdf meebo oligo naming conventions meebo printing instructions an updated version 051705 of these the meebo oligo annotations txt for more information on meebochip you can also see the illumina site where you can find the data sheet pdf and the original oligo annotation file xls or the ucsf mouse microarray consortium or the ucsf functional genomics core laboratories for more information about heebochip please see the heebo oligos as a track on the hg16 july 2003 genome browser a description of the heebo content naming conventions statistics for each oligo category as well as oligo annotations with gene names updated 051805 as a zip compressed excel file 6.5 mb there are currently more than 100 publications that have used meebochips and or heebochips you may find them here if you have purchased a meebo heebo set and have not been receiving e mail updates regarding contents controls etc please e mail me and i will add to the mailing list no spam none of the individuals involved in the design of the meebo heebo sets have any financial interest in the products based on these sequences ash alizadeh max diehn chris seidel brown lab and sfgf last updated tuesday may 24 2005 6 00 pm
