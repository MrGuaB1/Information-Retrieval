wave drag due to lift wave drag due to lift the expression given for wave drag due to lift holds for wings of very low aspect ratio a more general expression is derived by rt jones in minimum drag of airfoils at supersonic speeds j of aero sciences dec 1952 the combined vortex and wave drag may be written this expression approaches the correct limits for ellipses as m 1 and as ar 0 or infinity the assumption here is that the lift distribution is elliptical in all directions an assumption that is not realized exactly in practice jones also gives an expression for the wave drag due to lift for a yawed ellipse showing that there is an optimum sweep angle at m 1.4 a 10 1 yawed ellipse at 55 has less than 1 2 of the wave drag of the ellipse with 0 or 90 of yaw when the planform shape is not elliptical it may be better to form an equivalent ellipse with the same area and length rather than one with the same aspect ratio as the real wing in this case here s is the wing area and l is the overall length this choice preserves the average wing pressure difference and agrees well with experimental data for well designed supersonic wings supersonic drag due to lift computed by present method and boeing optimization results
