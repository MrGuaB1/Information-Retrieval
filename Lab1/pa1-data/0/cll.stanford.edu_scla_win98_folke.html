computational learning seminar seminar on computational learning and adaptation data mining and machine learning in finance the application of exchange rate forecasting folke a rauscher daimler benz research & technology ulm germany within the research fields of machine learning and data mining the development of intelligent and adaptive methods have among others led to most exciting applications in finance these methods for the intelligent analysis of large data sets have emerged from several historically disjoint fields such as applied statistics information systems machine learning data engineering artificial intelligence and knowledge discovery in databases within the quantitative financial research these emerging technologies become amenable to data driven modeling as large sets of financial data become available and therefore mine able in this talk i first briefly describe the data mining and machine learning activities at daimler benz research & technology in germany in general then i describe the more specific application of intelligent and adaptive methods for exchange rate forecasting in an corporate business environment here i discuss neural networks multi task learning aspects decision and regressions trees in the context of and as applied to quantitative financial research finally i raise some future research aspects which i would be happy to collaboratively address during my visit at stanford through march date thurs january 15 time 4 15 5 30pm place gates 100 the goal of this seminar is to increase communication among local researchers with interests in computational approaches to learning and adaptation if you would like to be added to or removed from the mailing list or if you are interested in giving a talk in the seminar please send email to iba isle org return to seminar schedule
