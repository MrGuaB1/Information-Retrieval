chemical engineering nanotechnology stanford engineering intranet nanotechnology the enhanced ability to control and characterize materials at the molecular level has fueled the rapidly growing science of nanotechnology research within the department of chemical engineering at stanford is at the forefront of this new and exciting field at the nanometer length scale certain materials demonstrate novel properties quite different from their macroscopic behavior semiconductor technologies developed in our department are reaching design dimensions of a single nanometer exploiting materials that are both inexpensive and mechanically flexible researchers in our department study biological phenomena at the molecular level rather than the cellular level to further understand mechanisms of drug delivery and metabolism characterizing and designing polymers at the nanoscale has led to the development of new materials with unique structure properties and functions nanotechnology research within our department includes understanding charge transport in organic semiconductors bao single molecule devices bao carbon nanotube sorting purification assembly and devices bao development of organic rather than the traditional inorganic materials as chemical barriers in computer chips bent exploration of the microdynamics of polymer molecules including dna to enable separation processes based on reading nano barcodes rather than the traditional electrophoresis techniques shaqfeh flow characterization of complex fluids to reduce drag in turbulent flows and to control cellular transport in drug delivery applications shaqfeh gold nanoparticle synthesis and study of catalytic activity jaramillo manipulating polymeric and other complex materials to examine interfacial dynamics and rheological properties fuller using complex fluid dynamics to alter the orientation of molecules for applications in the electronics and biological industries fuller design and characterization of high strength interpenetrating network hydrogels for biomaterial functions including wound healing tissue replacement and an artificial cornea frank analysis of the structure and function of proteins and macromolecules at interfaces frank development of biorenewable polymer composites and foams for green building materials frank theoretical modeling of the self assembly of clathrin proteins into nanoscale structures spakowitz developing virus like particle based nanoparticles as imaging agents for metastatic cancer swartz stanford home engineering home cheme home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved chemical engineering faculty & research list of faculty by name faculty openings biotechnology energy nanotechnology research & training centers staff prospective students current students alumni giving to cheme contact us
