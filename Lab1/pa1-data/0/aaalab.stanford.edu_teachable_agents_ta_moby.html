aaa lab at stanford teachable agents moby teachable agents moby moby has been designed to help students learn science content in the context of hypothetico deductive reasoning students attempt to induce the factors that regulate the appearance or non appearance of a particular outcome test their hypothesis against evil moby and then teach good moby who tests the rule in a game against an evil moby up to two factors or their negation may be necessary and or sufficient and in an and or or relationship in the current example we use flowers teachers and instructional designers however can easily add domain specific science content resources and images through a simple menu system this figure shows the basic interface students use to induce an underlying rule students click on factors to the right to overlay them on the flower grid the panel in the middle is for taking notes students drag specific results into the columns of always sometimes and never once students believe they have induced the correct hypothesis they can play against evil moby themselves before they teach good moby a new grid appears and they try to out predict where the flowers will be given the factors or where the factors will be given the flowers the games help students think about and test the logical implications of their rule in both directions the feedback helps students check their rules against confirming and falsifying evidence students have multiple opportunities to induce any given rule and play the games once students believe they know the rule they teach good moby the next figure shows two ways that students can teach moby they can use pull down menus to make a logical assertion in this case shade & sun are necessary they can also use a 2x2 table and specify whether the cells always sometimes or never have flowers when students use both controlled by the system moby checks the two versions against one another and provides graduated prompts when they do not match afterwards moby uses the rule to play prediction games against evil moby and students can evaluate their formal rule when applied consistently moby supports progressive sequencing of levels so that science ideas can be introduced over the course of a unit at the end of the unit moby will have a body of knowledge about the conditions for various outcomes a next step in our development of moby is to make it so he knows when to apply which rule in the meantime we have tested moby in high school and elementary classrooms and found meaningful gains in the ability to induce relations draw implications about likely outcomes and translate between different forms of logical expression we have also found that using the interface for teaching plus the independent performance of good moby improves student learning compared to simply playing the game and recording a rule with the interface with no implications for how an agent will subsequently perform in the future to download a version of moby click here windows only sorry the following is a brief description of how to use moby description in the city there are flowers moby wants to learn which factor s influence whether flowers will grow you need to learn the rule and teach moby phase i learn the rule start on level 1 overlay the factors one by one on the flower map to find the rule at first you will need only one factor later the rule may involve two factors phase ii play evil moby when you think you know the rule play a game against evil moby click on you on the menu bar highlight play game 1 click on the factor s to help you guess where the flowers will be click on a square to guess the presence or absence of a flower on that square to guess that a flower will not appear select guess absence from the right hand tool bar evil moby will guess and then it is your turn again phase iii teach moby when you think you know the rule teach moby click on moby in the menu bar select teach me from the drop down menu use the teaching menus to tell moby the rule when you are satisfied click ok moby will use what you have taught him to play against evil moby if moby wins by 3 points or more you have passed the level and can move on if moby loses you can try to teach him again to move on click levels to play a new game at a level click new rule authoring moby it is possible to create new content for moby teachers can tailor moby to their specific classes to author content go to the file menu the options and steps should be self evident
