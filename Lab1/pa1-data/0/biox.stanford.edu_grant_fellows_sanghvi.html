bio x stanford university jayodita sanghvi bio x bioengineering graduate fellow 2007 professor markus covert bioengineering jayodita has been developing a computational model of the smallest known bacterium which describes the dynamics of every molecule in the cell and includes the function of every gene the model involves the integrated understanding of metabolism replication transcription translation regulation and more she has also been developing means to experimentally validate the model manipulation of the virtual cell will enable a better understanding of cell physiology and help uncover unknown cell mechanisms future expansion of the model may help predict cell responses to drugs and environmental stresses or provide insight on how to engineer cells to perform desired functions fellowships
