coarse grain carry architecture for fpga chuck h lee hyukjunl arith stanford edu computer systems laboratory department of electrical engineering stanford university wednesday jan 20th 12 15am fpgas are emerging as a viable alternative to custom logic or dsp in the areas where throughput and energy efficiency are the major concern in this talk i will introduce the concept of throughput density which will be used as a metric to compare different fpga architectures and its relation to energy delay product then i will continue by talking about the performance bottleneck of current architecture especially the grain size as a method to increase the grain size new coarse grain architecture will be presented and its simulated performance over various applications will be discussed
