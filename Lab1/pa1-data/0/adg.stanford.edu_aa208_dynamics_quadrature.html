quadrature methods 2.7 time based integration of the equations of motion this section is under construction stay tuned although much may be said from the solutions to the linearized equations of motion in many cases we are interested in the nonlinear response the linearized expressions are very convenient for initial control law design but the full nonlinear equations are often integrated in the time domain to verify that the response of a system to large disturbances such as gusts are acceptable nonlinear simulation is also valuable for systems with strongly nonlinear characteristics in a region of the flight envelope in these cases numerical integration of the system of ode's is undertaken just how this is done may be very important to obtaining useful results issues in the numerical integration include the following choice of the basic integration scheme order update rule selection of the time step or adaptation method methods for presenting results incorporation of pilot or sensor inputs inclusion of flight control software and or hardware selection of the appropriate degrees of freedom to be included environment modeling turbulence gusts runway roughness many different methods for integrating the equations of motion for aerospace vehicles are in common use runge kutta methods are very common for all kinds of numerical integration and are frequently used in simulation but other methods such second order adams bashforth methods are popular for real time simulation
