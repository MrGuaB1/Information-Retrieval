bio x stanford university bio x postdoctoral fellowships 2009 yu shan lin chemistry professor vijay pande chemistry mounting research evidence suggests that soluble oligomers of amyloid beta a peptide play a causal role in alzheimers disease this research project describes an interdisciplinary approach to provide valuable insight into the important problem of a oligomerization the pande lab proposes to utilize advanced simulation techniques to provide structural thermodynamic and kinetic information on the structure and oligomerization of a peptides they shall obtain testable spectroscopic predictions by integrating their simulations with theoretical vibrational spectroscopy tristan ursell bioengineering professor kerwyn huang bioengineering tristan's research has concentrated on the mesoscopic scale where proteins lipids and their aggregates are examined as mechanical elements that respond to stresses in the environment his goal is to probe the importance of physical and mechanical forces in mechanisms driving cellular organization by integrating approaches from experimental cell biology biochemistry and biophysics with theoretical studies based on mechanics statistical physics and computational biology as a consequence it will benefit from natural collaborations with faculty from the schools of medicine and engineering fellowships
