brunger lab web site research group members publications project gallery contact information cns sbgrid intranet research activities our goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of synaptic neurotransmission we are interested in the structure function and dynamics of key players in the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery our lab is also working on the mechanism of action of clostridial neurotoxins that target this machinery other projects include protein complexes that are involved in synaptic development and the atpases of the aaa family that are involved in protein complex disassembly and degradation a molecular understanding of these complex protein machineries may ultimately lead to new therapeutics to treat human diseases selected projects recent publications model of snare complex synaptotagmin and complexin prior to calcium triggering structures single molecule studies of synaptotagmin molecular mechanism d arac aa boucard mf bolliger j nguyen sm soltis tc sudhof at brunger a novel evolutionarily conserved domain of cell adhesion gpcrs mediates autoproteolysis embo j advance online 2012 dj o donovan i stokes rees y nam sc blacklow gf schroeder at brunger p sliz a grid enabled web service for low resolution crystal structure refinement acta cryst d68 261 267 2012 m vrljic p strop rc hill kc hansen s chu at brunger post translational modifications and lipid binding profile of insect cell expressed full length mammalian synaptotagmin 1 biochemistry 50 9998 10012 2011 rj read pd adams wb arendall iii at brunger p emsley rp joosten gj kleywegt eb krissinel t lutteke z otwinowski a perrakis js richardson wh sheffler jl smith ij tickle g vriend ph zwart a new generation of crystallographic validation tools for the protein data bank structure 19 1395 1412 2011 m kyoung a srivastava y zhang j diao m vrljic p grob e nogales s chu at brunger in vitro system capable of differentiating fast calcium triggered content mixing from lipid exchange for mechanistic studies of neurotransmitter release proc natl acad sci usa 108 e304 e313 2011 td fenn mj schnieders m mustyakimov p langan vs pande at brunger reintroducing electrostatics into macromolecular crystallographic refinement application to neutron crystallography and dna hydration structure 19 523 533 2011 at brunger p strop m vrljic s chu kr weninger three dimensional molecular modeling with single molecule fret j struct biol 173 497 505 2011 view all projects view all publications
