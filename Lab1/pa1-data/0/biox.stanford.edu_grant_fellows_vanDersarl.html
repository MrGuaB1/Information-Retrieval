bio x stanford university jules vandersarl materials science & engineering bio x graduate student fellowships 2005 2006 profs nicholas melosh materials science & engineering and michael longaker surgery jules is involved in exploring new methods to use nanoscale electronics to direct stem cell differentiation in an effort to better understand and control the spatial and temporal events that occur during differentiation they are developing an active electronic chip that stores signaling chemicals within nano reservoirs and releases them when activated with an electronic signal this chip will allow them to extend the spatial and temporal control of soluble signals down to an individual cell for unprecedented control over the local cellular environment fellowships
