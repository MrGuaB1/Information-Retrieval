probability collectives probability collectives home synopsis probability collectives is a broad framework for analyzing and controlling distributed systems it is based on deep formal connections relating game theory statistical physics and distributed control optimization this site provides some papers detailing the theory as well as applications of probability collectives in some cases the papers below are revised and corrected versions of the originals which appeared in the references listed dissertations probability collectives for aerospace systems includes theory and implementation of approach and applies it to a range of optimization problems and experiments in distributed flight control stefan bieniawski distributed optimization and flight control using collectives stanford university september 2005 defense presentation dissertation theory papers theory introduction david h wolpert information theory the bridge connecting bounded rational game theory and statistical physics in complex engineering systems edited by yaneer bar yam and dan braha perseus books in print pdf ps presentation which introduces the theory david h wolpert bounded rationality and statistical physics nasa arc 03 097 pdf highlighting the connection to game theory david h wolpert what information theory says about best response and about binding contracts in proceeding of wehia 2004 edited by akira namatame et al springer verlag in print ps theory applied to distributed control david h wolpert and stefan bieniawski distributed control by lagrangian steepest descent in proceeding of the conference of decision and control 2004 pdf ps theory applied to reinforcement learning david h wolpert and stefan bieniawski distributed adaptive control beyond single instant discrete variables msras 2004 in advances in soft computing edited by andrzej jankowski andrzej skowron and marcin szczuka springer verlag 2004 ps finding bounded rational equilibria david h wolpert finding bounded rational equilibria part i interative focusing in proceeding of the eleventh international symposium on dynamic games and applications tucson arizona december 18 21 2004 part 1 part 2 draft example of semi coordinate transformations stephen airiau and david h wolpert product distribution theory and semi coordinate transformations unpublished pdf application papers comparison with genetic algorithms chien feng huang stefan bieniawski charlie em strauss and david h wolpert a comparative study of probability collectives based multiagent systems and genetic algorithms submitted to gecco 2005 pdf optimization stefan bieniawski david h wolpert and ilan kroo discrete continuous and constrained optimization using collectives aiaa paper 2004 4580 presented at the 10th aiaa issmo multidisciplinary analysis and optimization conference albany ny august 30 september 1 2004 pdf theory validation and techniques to account for unknown form of the world utility chiu fan lee and david h wolpert product distribution theory for control of multi agent systems in proceedings of the third international joint conference on autonomous agents and multi agent systems new york ny july 19 23 2004 pdf comparisons with distributed reinforcement learning stefan bieniawski and david h wolpert adaptive distributed control of constrained multi agent systems in proceedings of the third international joint conference on autonomous agents and multi agent systems new york ny july 19 23 2004 pdf poster satisfiability k sat also highlighting mixture models william macready and david h wolpert distributed optimization presented at the international conference on complex systems boston ma may 16 21 2004 pdf ps metropolis hastings sampling david h wolpert and chiu fan lee adaptive metropolis sampling with product distributions presented at the international conference on complex systems boston ma may 16 21 2004 pdf ps comparisons with serial and parallel brouwer stefan bieniawski and david h wolpert product distributions for distributed optimization presented at the international conference on complex systems boston ma may 16 21 2004 pdf ps aircraft routing nicolas e antoine stefan bieniawski david h wolpert and ilan kroo fleet assignement using collective intelligence aiaa paper 2004 0622 presented at 42nd aiaa aerospace sciences meeting reno nv january 5 8 2004 pdf extended version last update february 15 2005 by stefan bieniawski
