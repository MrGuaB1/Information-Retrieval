untitled aa208 assignment 4 due tues may 14 2002 boeing 717 200 the wing area of this airplane is 1000 ft 2 based on trapezoidal reference extended into centerline and has a sweep at the c 4 line of 24.5 degrees the taper ratio is 0.20 the tail area is 275.5 ft 2 with a taper ratio of 0.352 and a sweep of 31.6 deg at the c 4 line the distance from the wing 25 mac to the tail 25 mac location is 52.5 ft the airplane weighs 100000 lbs 1 estimate the location of the neutral stability point or aerodynamic center for the wing tail combination shown above at low speeds ignore the fuselage effects and the very important nacelle and pylon effects for the moment a use analytic formulas for lift curve slope including downwash on the tail and assume the ac of each surface is located at 25 of its mac b use the linair program in the notes and compare your answers why are these different 2 compute the tail lift required to trim at c l 45 if the cg were located at 25 of the wing mac and the wing c m_a c was 0.07 based on mac express your answer in terms of l tail l wing you may use analytic expressions or the linair program to compute this 3 estimate the airplane trim drag ignoring compressibility effects the trim drag is the extra airplane drag associated with the requirement for trim express your answer in terms of dc d_trim note that the overall airplane c d is about 0.030 at this flight condition
