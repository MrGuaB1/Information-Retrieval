stanford engineering intranet water environment effective solutions new approaches the water environment includes coastal zones rivers lakes estuaries groundwater soil water and even the atmosphere as part of the hydrologic cycle it is now clear that the management of the water environment for sustainable human benefit requires the development of environmental policies promoting ecosystem health and human safety with accordant management and operation of facilities and systems extending traditional boundaries traditionally civil and environmental engineers have focused on studying parts of the system or designing specific components of an engineered system such as studying the dilution of effluent achieved through an ocean outfall in order to design an appropriate diffuser our attention now extends beyond the performance of individual components to the performance of whole systems and the interaction of different systems with each other eg the influence of large water project operations on estuarine and coastal fisheries developing the knowledge tools given the complex problems facing the planet and the need for efficient and cost effective strategies we are focusing our efforts on the scientific engineering economic social and political aspects in an integrated and comprehensive way we are leveraging our strengths in building multidisciplinary teams that may include for example experts in social sciences biology or fisheries within major research thrusts such as water supply and treatment coastal zone problems and groundwater we are emphasizing the development of comprehensive analytical numerical and observational tools that enable us to characterize the physical chemical and microbial environment as well as to translate this knowledge into design principles and management policies faculty working in this area coastal oceans please choose boehm ali freyberg david fringer oliver koseff jeff luthy dick monismith stephen reinhard martin street robert ecohydrology please choose freyberg david kitanidis peter koseff jeff leckie jim luthy dick monismith stephen street robert water health & development please choose boehm ali davis jennifer leckie jim mccarty perry ortolano len reinhard martin water quality reclamation & recycle please choose boehm ali criddle craig leckie jim luthy dick mccarty perry ortolano len reinhard martin spormann alfred water resources please choose criddle craig davis jennifer freyberg david kitanidis peter leckie jim luthy dick mccarty perry ortolano len stanford home engineering home cee home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students alumni about cee atmosphere energy built environment water environment programs faculty & staff research admissions events calendar visit us
