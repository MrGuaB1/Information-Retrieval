addition and floating point addition next up previous next floating point multiplication up algorithms and systems previous wave pipelining addition and floating point addition we have been able to optimize earlier work by ling on integer adders 1 to avoid excessive fanout yet preserve the speed advantage we have also mapped the ling approach over to cmos technology p13 we have made basic improvements to the floating point addition algorithm conventionally floating point addition consists of a subtraction of exponents a shifting of fractions by an amount equal to the exponent difference addition or subtraction of the fractions a shifting of the result on subtraction to leave it in normalized form and a rounding of the result these steps are generally sequential and require two shifts and three additions the exponent subtraction fraction addition and rounding farmwald in earlier work 2 showed that one of the shifts could be eliminated by creating two simultaneous paths since a long preshift could not be accompanied by a long postshift following the fraction addition multiplication quach has shown that it is possible to further improve the floating point addition by integrating the rounding step with the final fraction addition p14 this is done by creating up to four different results and muxing out the correct result by careful management and integration of the paths the overall hardware cost is only modestly increased over the state of the art approach a floating point adder based upon this idea has been fabricated and is being tested using a conventional 1 micron cmos process the floating point addition delay is about 15 16 nanoseconds ieee standard floating point addition michael flynn tue dec 13 10 27 47 pst 1994
