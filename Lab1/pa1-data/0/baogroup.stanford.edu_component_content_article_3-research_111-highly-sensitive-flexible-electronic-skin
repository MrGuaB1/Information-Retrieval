highly sensitive flexible electronic skin employing microstructured dielectric bao research group stanford university home people current alumni new member research research topics archived news wikilab lab members only publications press contact us visitors abstract the development of an electronic skin is critical to the realization of artificial intelligence that comes into direct contact with humans and to biomedical applications such as prosthetic skin to mimic the tactile sensing properties of natural skin large arrays of pixel pressure sensors on a flexible and stretchable substrate are required we demonstrate flexible capacitive pressure sensors with unprecedented sensitivity and very short response times that can be inexpensively fabricated over large areas by microstructuring of thin films of the biocompatible elastomer polydimethylsiloxane the pressure sensitivity of the microstructured films far surpassed that exhibited by unstructured elastomeric films of similar thickness and is tunable by using different microstructures the microstructured films were integrated into organic field effect transistors as the dielectric layer forming a new type of active sensor device with similarly excellent sensitivity and response times full paper at http www nature com nmat journal vaop ncurrent abs nmat2834 html copyright 2009 2011 all rights reserved credits bao group benjamin tee soumen barmen logo by benjamin tee
