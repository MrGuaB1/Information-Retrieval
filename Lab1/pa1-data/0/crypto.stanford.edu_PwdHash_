pwdhash web password hashing description publications download challenges project staff description the common password problem users tend to use a single password at many different web sites by now there are several reported cases where attackers breaks into a low security site to retrieve thousands of username password pairs and directly try them one by one at a high security e commerce site such as ebay as expected this attack is remarkably effective a simple solution pwdhash is an browser extension that transparently converts a user's password into a domain specific password the user can activate this hashing by choosing passwords that start with a special prefix or by pressing a special password key f2 pwdhash automatically replaces the contents of these password fields with a one way hash of the pair password domain name as a result the site only sees a domain specific hash of the password as opposed to the password itself a break in at a low security site exposes password hashes rather than an actual password we emphasize that the hash function we use is public and can be computed on any machine which enables users to login to their web accounts from any machine in the world hashing is done using a pseudo random function prf phishing protection a major benefit of pwdhash is that it provides a defense against password phishing scams in a phishing scam users are directed to a spoof web site where they are asked to enter their username and password spoofguard is a browser extension that alerts the user when a phishing page is encountered pwdhash complements spoofguard in defending users from phishng scams using pwdhash the phisher only sees a hash of the password specific to the domain hosting the spoof page this hash is useless at the site that the phisher intended to spoof publications blake ross collin jackson nicholas miyake dan boneh and john c mitchell stronger password authentication using browser extensions proceedings of the 14th usenix security symposium 2005 powerpoint presentation related project spoofguard download please note these prototypes are intended for demonstration purposes only we reserve the right to change the hashing algorithm in future versions which may require you to reset your passwords if you want to upgrade version 1.7 for mozilla firefox 3.5 and earlier installer 16kb source code 16kb version 0.6 beta for internet explorer 7 installer 537kb source code 144kb version 0.5 beta for internet explorer 6 installer 628kb source code 147kb opera users may be interested in haris andrianakis's pwdhash for opera but read about the limitations of user scripts in our paper send us feedback deployment challenges pwdhash preserves the benefits of password authentication such as mobility without any hardware requirements our primary design goals are not to change to the user experience and not to require server side changes to do so we had to overcome a number of challenges pwdhash must defend against javascript at a phishing site that may confuse users into typing their passwords in an insecure location such as a text field that is made to look like a password field pwdhash includes a number of clever mechanisms to defend against such attacks after pwdhash is installed users can set up hashed passwords at the various sites they use by resetting their password typically reset pages ask the user to type in the old password and then enter the new password twice pwdhash must somehow recognize the old password field and avoid hashing it pwdhash relies on the user to pick new passwords that start with so that they can be distinguished from regular passwords alternatively the user can press the password key f2 before entering the password to indicate that the password should be hashed we found a small number of sites ie one site where the password reset page is hosted on a different domain than the password use page as a result the wrong password hash is registered at the site after password reset one solution is to create a list of such sites so that pwdhash can tell how to handle them other solutions involving server side changes are also possible occasionally users want to login to their web accounts on machines where they cannot install browser extensions eg at internet cafes in this case users can connect to our web site https www pwdhash com where they are presented with one of the following forms depending on whether their browser supports clipboard operations via script internet explorer 6.0 firefox 1.0 javascript computes the password hash on the local machine so that the user's password is never communicated to stanford the resulting hashed password can be pasted into the user's web login form project staff dan boneh collin jackson john mitchell nick miyake blake ross stanford security lab
