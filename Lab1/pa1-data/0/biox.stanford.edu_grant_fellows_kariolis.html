bio x stanford university mihalis kariolis bio x bioengineering graduate fellow 2008 professor jennifer cochran bioengineering using yeast surface display and directed evolution the cochran lab engineers novel proteins for use in applications ranging from cancer therapy and imaging to wound healing mihalis's research is focused on engineering the agouti related protein agrp for binding to the integrin iib3 this integrin is highly expressed on the platelet membrane and when activated it engenders aggregation and subsequent clot formation though essential to wound healing aberrant platelet aggregation can lead to myocardial infarctions embolisms and strokes engineering agrp to bind specifically to the iib3 integrin would limit platelet activation and subsequently lessen the risk of ischemic events fellowships
