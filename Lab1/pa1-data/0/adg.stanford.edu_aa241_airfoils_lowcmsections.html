low cm airfoil design low moment airfoil design when the airfoil pitching moment is constrained it is not always possible to carry lift as far back on the airfoil as desired such situations arise in the design of sections for tailless aircraft helicopter rotor blades and even sails kites and giant pterosaurs the airfoil shown here is a liebeck section designed to perform well at low reynolds numbers with a positive c m0 its performance is not bad but it is clearly inferior in c lmax when compared to other sections without a c m constraint c lmax 1.35 vs 1.60 for conventional sections at re 500000 the thickest section at re 10 million is 57 thick but of course it will separate suddenly with any angle of attack
