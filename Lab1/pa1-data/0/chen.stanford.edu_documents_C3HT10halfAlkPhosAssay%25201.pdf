luminescence assay for alkaline phosphatase activity of c3h10t 1 2 cells page 1 luminescence assay for alkaline phosphatase activity of c3h10t 1 2 cells reagents luminometer assay plate lysis buffer 100 mm tris ph 9.5 250 mm nacl 25 mm mgcl2 1 triton x 100 cdp star chemiluminescence reagent perkinelmer procedure 1 seed 96 well tissue culture plate with 5000 c3h10t1 2 cells well in dmem containing 10 fetal bovine serum and penicillin streptomycin 2 allow cells to grow to confluency typically 36 48 hours 3 switch cells to dmem 0.5 calf serum medium containing appropriate signaling agonists and or antagonists and controls continue growth of cells for 36 48 hrs 4 remove media and add 50 l of lysis buffer to each well incubate with rocking for 45 minutes 5 transfer 10 l of lysate to 96 well assay plate 6 add 50 l of room temperature cdp star reagent to each lysate containing well of the assay plate and incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark 7 read plate on luminometer one second or less integration time should be sufficient notes 1 cells may be seeded at higher density to reduce time to confluency 2 amount of lysate used in assay as well as amount of reagent are flexible but should not exceed a 1 2 ratio 3 incubation time before plate reading may have subtle effects on data and should be held constant for best comparison between experiments
