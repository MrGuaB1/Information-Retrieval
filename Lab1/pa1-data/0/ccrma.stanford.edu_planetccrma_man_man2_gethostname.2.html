gethostname gethostname 2 name gethostname sethostname get set host name synopsis include unistd h int gethostname char name size_t len int sethostname const char name size_t len description these functions are used to access or to change the host name of the current processor the gethostname function returns a nul terminated hostname set earlier by sethostname in the array name that has a length of len bytes in case the nul terminated hostname does not fit no error is returned but the hostname is truncated it is unspecified whether the truncated hostname will be nul terminated return value on success zero is returned on error 1 is returned and errno is set appropriately errors einval len is negative or for sethostname len is larger than the max imum allowed size or for gethostname on linux i386 len is smaller than the actual size in this last case glibc 2.1 uses enametoolong eperm for sethostname the caller was not the superuser efault name is an invalid address conforming to svr4 4.4 bsd this function first appeared in 4.2 bsd posix 1003.1 2001 specifies gethostname but not sethostname bugs for many linux kernel libc combinations gethostname will return an error instead of returning a truncated hostname notes susv2 guarantees that host names are limited to 255 bytes posix 1003.1 2001 guarantees that host names not including the terminating nul are limited to host_name_max bytes see also getdomainname 2 setdomainname 2 uname 2 linux 2.5 0 2001 12 15 gethostname 2
