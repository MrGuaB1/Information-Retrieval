computational genomic biology computational genomics biochemistry 228 doug brutlag course description computational genomics is a graduate level course targeted at graduate students or upper level undergraduates desiring an advanced knowledge of the application of computational genomic methods to biological problems topics to be covered include assembly of genomic sequences genome databases comparative genomics gene discovery gene expression analyses including gene clustering by expression transcription factor binding site discovery metabolic pathway discovery functional genomics gene and genome ontologies and medical diagnostics using snps and gene expression we will also cover gene regulation via epigenetic and port transcriptional mechanisms the course will be based on recent papers from the literature as well as practical hands on use of these methods prerequisites include an introductory course in computational molecular biology or genomics such as biochem 218 biomedical informatics 214 genetics 211 or permission of instructor course requirements there will be several homework assignments utilizing the tools described in the lectures all homework and final projects will be submitted in electronic form generally as e mail or e mail attachments a final paper will be required for the course that critically and constructively analyzes one of the areas related to the theme of the course the final project may also present a novel application of existing tools or the development of some new or improved method the final projects will be due friday december 7 2007 there will be no extensions of this deadline the homework will count for 35 of the final grade and the final project will count for 65 course availability biochemistry 228 will be taught live in the spring quarter 2007 2008 the course will also be available online via the stanford center for professional development scpd the course will be available to off campus students during all three quarters via scpd registration registration is limited to 50 students on campus students must register with the registrar's office off campus students must register with the stanford center for professional development auditors anyone on stanford campus or participating in stanford overseas campus may audit the lectures on the internet via stanford online during a quarter this course is being taught all lectures are recorded and made available via streaming video see below for instructions there is no limit on the number of auditors stanford online lectures are available 24 hours a day 7 days a week the only requirement is that the auditors must use a computer on campus in the stanford edu domain and have a valid sunet id in order to view the lecture auditors will also be permitted to attend the classes as long as there are seats available no homework will be permitted and no grade will be awarded for auditors teaching assistants and staff lee kozar kozar stanford edu is the associate director of the bioinformatics resource at stanford and is in charge of the computing facilities including software and databases that will be used for the homework questions concerning the programs databases and other computing resources used in the course should be addressed to him kimberley latta klatta stanford edu is the administrator for the course you should contact her for all administrative needs such as web page problems student status etc lecture syllabus date topic lecturer the human genome project doug brutlag genome databases doug brutlag genome assembly doug brutlag gene finding doug brutlag comparative genomics & gene regulatory regions eddy rubin functional genomics doug brutlag non coding rna genes doug brutlag genome annotation doug brutlag clustering coordinately regulated genes doug brutlag discovering dna regulatory motifs i doug brutlag discovering dna regulatory motifs ii doug brutlag dna methylation & epigenetic gene regulation doug brutlag translational regulation sirna and microrna doug brutlag diseases and phenotypes doug brutlag snps & sts markers and haplotype mapping doug brutlag ultraconserved regions gill bejerano metabolic pathways a peter karp metabolic pathways b peter karp the encode project doug brutlag copy number variation doug brutlag archived tutorials tutorials topic lecturer intro to the gcg seqweb interface lee kozar literature search techniques lee kozar sequence comparison and demo of gcg seqweb bestfit and gap lee kozar description of progressive pairwise alignment algorithm and its use by the seqweb bestfit program lee kozar phylogenetic analysis intro and use of distance methods to study evolutionary relationships lee kozar bioinformatics week videos https cmgm stanford edu classes ebi ncbi videos bioinformatics resource courses http cmgm stanford edu classes last updated september 29 2007
