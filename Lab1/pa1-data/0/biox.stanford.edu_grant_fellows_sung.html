bio x stanford university jong min sung applied physics bio x graduate student fellowships 2009 2010 professor james spudich biochemistry the objective of jong's research is to obtain a precise correlation between the mechanical structural and biochemical aspects of actomyosin interactions associated with human beta cardiac myosin cardiomyopathies at a single molecule level the spudich lab's hypothesis is that the structural changes caused by the mutations will cause malfunctions of beta cardiac myosin in terms of 1 force generation roles step size force 2 enzymatic roles actin activated atpase and 3 coordination between them to clarify with molecular precision which aspects of chemo mechanical transduction are altered by selected hcm familial mutations we will directly measure individual actomyosin interactions using a variety of single molecule tools fellowships
