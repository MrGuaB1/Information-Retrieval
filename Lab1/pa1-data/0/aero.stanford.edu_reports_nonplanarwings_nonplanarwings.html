highly nonplanar lifting systems highly nonplanar lifting systems ilan kroo stanford university john mcmasters boeing commercial airplane group and stephen c smith nasa ames research center presented at transportation beyond 2000 technologies needed for engineering design nasa langley research center september 26 28 1995 abstract this paper deals with nonplanar wing concepts their advantages and possible application in a variety of aircraft designs a brief review and assessment of several concepts from winglets to ring wings is followed by a more detailed look at two recent ideas exploiting nonplanar wakes to reduce induced drag and applying a c wing design to a large commercial transport results suggest that potential efficiency gains may be significant while several non aerodynamic characteristics are particularly interesting outline introduction and background some results what is possible a closer look at two concepts exploiting nonplanar wakes a very nonplanar wing the c wing concept conclusions and postscript references
