on the representation of abelian groups as chu spaces page 1 on the representation of abelian groups as chu spaces vaughan pratt january 9 2005 abstract we compare two representations of abelian groups as chu spaces the first represents the elements of any ternary relational structure as words on an 8 letter alphabet the second is based on the group characters using group characters as states the finite cyclic groups of order n are the following square chu spaces over 0 1 n 2 n n 1 n z2 00 01 2 z3 000 012 021 3 z4 0000 0123 0202 0321 4 z5 00000 01234 02413 03142 04321 5 by 3 we mean pointwise division by 3 so that the apparent alphabet 0 1 2 is really 0 1 3 2 3 these are enough examples to make the pattern for zn obvious take the chu space to be integer multiplication not the group operation which is addition divided elementwise by n the group operation can then be recovered as co ordinatewise addition mod 1 of the representing rows these chu spaces are self dual as a corollary of the commutativity of integer multiplication the klein four group v4 z2 z2 z2 z2 doesn t fit this pattern for one thing how would you map its elements to numbers nevertheless it has group characters namely the columns of v4 0000 0101 0011 0110 2 this is a chu space over 2 0 1 2 schizophrenically it is also the 2d vector space over gf 2 1 page 2 z5 z6 and z7 are respectively the only group only abelian group and only group of that order already treated above at 8 there are z8 z2 z4 and 3 z2 z2 z2 z2 we ve seen z8 the other two are z2 z4 00000000 01230123 02020202 03210321 00002222 01232301 02022020 03212103 4 3 z2 00000000 01010101 00110011 01100110 00001111 01011010 00111100 01101001 2 3 z2 is the 3d vector space over gf 2 we do not know whether z2 z4 can masquerade as anything else familiar z8 is the 1d vector space over gf 8 at 9 we have z9 aka the 1d vector space over gf 9 and 2 z3 aka the 2d vector space over gf 3 2 z3 000000000 012012012 021021021 000111222 012120201 021102210 000222111 012201120 021210102 3 these are enough examples to permit deducing the general pattern for finite abelian groups which we will now describe for any direct sum direct product of n cyclic groups of respective orders c1 cn writing the elements of the product as n tuples a1 an which we use to index both rows and columns of the chu space the entry at row a1 an and column b1 bn is a1b1 c1 a2b2 c2 anbn cn mod1 for m pk where p is prime zm is representable over an alphabet of size p in general the alphabet needed to represent a finite abelian group is the largest square free divisor of its order for example if 2 and 3 are the only prime divisors of the order of g then g is representable in chu set 6 where 6 is understood to be the alphabet 0 1 6 2 6 5 6 this much concerns just the groups in isolation all this structure is basic to the theory of finite abelian groups and as such well known and elementary 2 page 3 for groups taken two or more at a time however we may ask about the contin uous functions between their chu representations since distinct groups will in general be represented over distinct alphabets the question arises as to whether this is even well defined the nice theorem exercise is that the homomor phisms between the chu representations of g and g in either direction are representable over the intersection of their respective alphabets or union when the source and target chu spaces are counted as part of the homomorphism and as such are exactly the continuous functions between those representations 3
