cegelski lab research home research people publications outreach contact links microbial amyloid structure and function e coli and other gram negative bacteria assemble extracellular adhesive amyloid fibers termed curli curli are among a growing list of functional amyloids that emphasize nature's ability to assemble amyloid fibers that exhibit uniquely tailored physiological functions curli mediate cell surface and cell cell interactions and serve as an adhesive and structural scaffold to promote biofilm assembly and other community behaviors curli biogenesis requires specific nucleation precipitation molecular machinery encoded by the csgba and csgdefg operons in vivo polymerization of the major curli subunit csga into  sheet rich amyloid fibers requires the nucleator protein csgb csgg is a membrane protein and csge and csgf are assembly factors required for the stabilization and transport of csga and csgb to the cell surface thus e coli harbors a tractable and genetically tunable model to dissect the molecular and structural basis of amyloid biogenesis in a cellular context we are working to transform cartoon representations of the curli fiber and membrane associated machinery into a molecular model using solid state nmr spectroscopy together with data from other techniques including microscopy fret and mass spectrometry as we develop new assays to probe curli biogenesis we are also working to identify and develop strategies to interfere with amyloid assembly
