center on nanostructuring for efficient energy conversion research cneec logo intranet research cneec's integrated center concept the overarching goal of the center is to increase the efficiency of energy conversion devices by manipulating materials at the nanometer scale we advance scientific concepts and develop fabrication and characterization methodologies to understand how nanostructuring can optimize transport light absorption and reaction kinetics and thermodynamics in materials our research aims to provide a scientific foundation of underlying physical and chemical phenomena shared by a diverse range of energy conversion processes for both energy generation and storage devices and to exploit them in materials to achieve break out high efficiency cost effective energy technologies to reach this goal we have organized our research into three thematic research groups trgs with expertise in theory materials synthesis characterization simulation device fabrication and testing trg1 nanoscale control of thermodynamic potentials trg2 nanoscale control over photons and electrons trg3 nanoscale control in catalysis we view these three themes reflected in our center concept as universal cross cutting topics that underlie virtually all attempts to improve energy conversion efficiency center on nanostructuring for efficient energy conversion is an energy frontier research center funded by the us department of energy office of science and office of basic energy sciences stanford home engineering home cneec home contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved cneec research trg1 trg2 trg3 publications faculty facilities tutorials get involved contact us
