biomechanical engineering conference at stanford 2011 keynote address professor rob phillips biography rob phillips is a professor of applied physics at the california institute of technology in pasadena california where he currently serves as the option representative for biochemistry and molecular biophysics phillips received his phd in condensed matter physics at washington university in 1989 prior to the privilege of a life in science he spent seven years of travel self study and work as an electrician work in his group centers on physical biology of the cell the use of physical models to explore biological phenomena and the construction of experiments designed to test them some of the key areas of interest include the physics of genome management such as how viruses and cells physically manipulate dna as part of their standard repertoire during their life cycles and how the physical properties of lipid bilayers are tied to the behavior of ion channels over the last eight years phillips has been working with professor jane kondev brandeis university and professor julie theriot stanford university on a book entitled physical biology of the cell recently published by garland science talk abstract the biological frontiers of mechanics we are living through a time of explosive growth in the study of the living world that i think parallels advances in astronomy after the invention of the telescope one of the powerful lenses through which these biological advances are being viewed is that of mechanics in this talk i will give a personal view of how our understanding of living matter can be colored by appealing to ideas from mechanics writ large my key argument will be that the mechanical world view can be useful at length scales ranging from the molecular machines that make cells tick to that of entire populations interacting in a given ecosystem simulia 3ds
