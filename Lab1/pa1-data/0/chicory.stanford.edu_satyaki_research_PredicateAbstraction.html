predicate abstraction predicate abstraction predicate abstraction is a technique that is used to prove properties of infinite state systems it is a combination of theorem proving and model checking techniques given a concrete infinite state system and a set of abstraction predicates a conservative finite state abstraction is generated it is conservative in the sense that for every execution in the concrete system there is a corresponding execution in the abstract system the abstract version of the verification condition is model checked in this abstract system if the property is verified then it holds in the concrete system otherwise an abstract counter example trace is generated there could be a concrete counter example corresponding to it in which case there is a bug in the design or the abstract counter example is an artifact of the abstraction our tool can automatically analyze the counter example to find a real bug or to suggest extra predicates to refine the abstraction thereby avoiding that particular spurious trace then the process starts anew this process is not guaranteed to terminate after all proving arbitrary safety properties of an infinite state system is not decidable but for a large number of problems this method can successfully prove properties computing the abstract transition relation can be expensive so at first we compute an approximate abstract transition relation if the abstract verification condition can be proved with this approximate system then we don t need to carry out further computation otherwise we check if every step of the abstract counter example trace is allowed in the exact abstract transition relation if that is the case then we have found an abstract trace and we don t need a more accurate transition relation otherwise a constraint is added to the abstract transition relation and the property model checked again in the more accurate approximation the complete process is described in the following diagram notice that there are two nested loops in the inner loop the predicates used remain the same while the abstract transition relation is refined as needed in the outer loop the abstraction itself is refined by adding new predicates predicate abstraction block diagram the prototype verification tool is written in common lisp it uses binary decision diagrams to implement the model checker and to represent the abstract system satisfibility checks of logic formulas over the concrete domain are carried out with cvc in addition to a lot of standard mutual exclusion algorithms this method has been applied with varying degrees of automation to the following problems on the fly garbage collection algorithm we proved that the garbage collector is conservative that is only unused memory is ever freed flash cache coherence protocol we deduced an inductive invariant that was needed to do the proof in pvs ibm cache coherence protocol multiple clients contend for shared read only and exclusive read write access to main memory we proved that this mutual exclusion is preserved secure contract signing protocol we proved that the protcol preserves fairness in the context of contract signing protocols fairness means that an individual that follows protocol steps correctly can never be cheated aodv routing protocol this is a routing protocol for a dynamic network where nodes can enter or leave the network at any time we proved that routing loops can never happen in this protocol under some assumptions the predicateabstractionexamples page has a listing of protocols that we have applied our tool to a brief description of the syntax can be found in the murphisyntax page publications abs bib ps satyaki das and david l dill counter example based predicate discovery in predicate abstraction in proceedings of fmcad 2002 portland oregon usa november 2002 abs bib ps satyaki das and david l dill successive approximation of abstract transition relations in proc of the sixteenth annual ieee symposium on logic in computer science boston massachusetts june 2001 abs bib ps satyaki das david l dill and seungjoon park experience with predicate abstraction 11th international conference on computer aided verification july 1999 software download coming soon satyaki das last modified fri may 16 00 11 41 pdt 2003
