bio x stanford university tyler hillman genetics mstp bio x graduate student fellowships 2008 2009 professor matthew scott developmental biology tyler's focus is on understanding how cells communicate with one another to influence fate decisions during embryo development and tumor formation in particular he studies the gene regulatory interactions controlled by the mammalian hedgehog signaling pathway he completed a high throughput rna interference screen in search of novel genes that regulate hedgehog signaling in mammals which resulted in the identification of several genes whose loss results in robust and reproducible inhibition of hedgehog signaling he is now following up these hits to better understand how they might regulate this important developmental and oncogenic signaling pathway fellowships
