post processing of oligo arrays on corning ultra gaps slides post processing of oligo arrays on corning ultra gaps slides martin buess draft version 01.17 06 use this for corning ultra gaps slides only do not use on polylysine coated surfaces postprocessing slides using a diamond scribe etch the non printed side of the array to denote the boundaries of the printed area uv cross link printed dna onto glass substrate with 65mj of energy in a stratalinker 650 x 100uj and transfer arrays on a slide rack prehybridization in 5x ssc 0.1 mg ml bsa 0.1 sds at 42 c for 60 min 300 ml mq h2o 100 ml filtered 20 x ssc 4 ml 10mg ml bsa stock solution filtered 4 ml 10 sds prewarm in 42 c waterbath for 60 min rinse in arrays in 0.1 x ssc for 5 min at rt repeat step 4 transfer arrays to mq water and incubate at rt for 30 sec spin dry arrays in a table to centrifuge at 500 rpm for 5 min note use arrays the same day that they are postprocessed
