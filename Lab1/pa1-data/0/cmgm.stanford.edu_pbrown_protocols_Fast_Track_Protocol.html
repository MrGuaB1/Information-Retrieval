revised protocol for fasttrack 2.0 mrna extraction from pma differentiated u937 cells revised protocol for fasttrack 2.0 mrna extraction human cells preparation of cells prepare or collect between 2x10 7 cells for each mrna prep will yield about 10 20g of mrna if pbmcs from a whole blood sample are to be used the sample should be prepared with ficoll paque according to the manufacturer's protocol the isolated pbmcs can then be used in this protocol if cells are adherent gently agitate and scrape cells from the surface of the flask with a cell scraper to suspend in the media if cells are non adherent proceed to next step place the suspension of cells in a 50ml conical tube pellet at 400xg for 5 minutes discard the supernatant leave the pellet intact freeze the pellet in a dry ice ethanol bath or on liquid n2 until solid store at 70 o c until ready for mrna preparation modified fasttrack 2.0 protocol isolation of mrna add 15ml of lysis buffer 15ml stock buffer 300 ul rnase protein degrader to the frozen pellet the tissue homogenizer should be cleaned so that it is rnase free at a minimum will require immersion and homogenization in ddh 2 o and ethanol 3 times sequentially may require boiling h 2 o sds or 10 bleach in addition an rnase degrader such as rnase zap can also be used shear each sample with a 3 5 second run of the tissue homogenizer essentially until the cell pellet is no longer visible clean homogenizer tip between runs incubate the sheared samples in lysis buffer at 45 o c for 45 minutes add 950 l 5m nacl stock solution and mix shear dna using a 21 gauge needle attached to a sterile 20cc syringe this step involves drawing the lysate into the syringe through the needle and expelling it from the syringe again through the needle this step should be repeated 3 times add one tube of oligo dt cellulose to each sample incubate for 2 minutes at room temperature vortex the sample to resuspend the cellulose completely rock the tube gently in a horizontal position for 60 90 minutes at room temperature centrifuge the oligo dt slurry at 3000 xg for 5 minutes at room temperature make sure the brake on the centrifuge is set at low for all centrifugation steps as a high brake may disturb the pellet carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant trying not to disturb the easily dispersed pellet washing oligo dt cellulose resuspend oligo dt in 20ml binding buffer by vortexing centrifuge at 3000 xg for 5 minutes at room temperature resuspend oligo dt in 10ml binding buffer by vortexing centrifuge at 3000 xg for 5 minutes at room temperature resuspend oligo dt in 10ml low salt wash buffer by vortexing centrifuge at 3000 xg for 5 minutes at room temperature repeat low salt wash buffer wash two more times resuspend oligo dt in 800l low salt wash buffer using a 1 2ml serological pipette transfer about 800l of the oligo dt slurry to a spin column seated in the included microcentrifuge tube centrifuge at 5000 xg for 10 seconds at room temperature aspirate and discard the flow through liquid in the microcentrifuge tube repeat the transfer and centrifugation steps until all of the oligo dt cellulose is in the spin column elution and precipitation of the mrna place the spin column containing the oligo dt into one of the included clean microcentrifuge tubes heat elution buffer to 65 o c in a bath or about 10 15 seconds in a microwave resuspend the oligo dt in 200l elution buffer heated using the pipette tip to gently swirl the cellulose without puncturing the underlying spin column membrane centrifuge at 5000 xg for 30 seconds at room temperature do not decant keep the eluent it contains your mrna again resuspend the oligo dt in 200l elution buffer heated centrifuge at 5000 xg for 30 seconds at room temperature save the combined 400l eluent in the microcentrifuge tube add 60l of 2m sodium acetate and mix add 1ml of 95 ethanol do not use 100 ethanol it contains fluorescent contaminants freeze at 70 o c overnight thaw and centrifuge at 16000 xg for 15 minutes at 4 o c carefully aspirate all the ethanol from the mrna pellet taking care not to disturb the pellet resuspend the mrna pellet in 20l of elution buffer heated as before determine the concentration of the mrna by od or eyeballing on an agarose minigel store mrna at 70 o c the standard fasttrack protocol can be found on the invitrogen website here ceb 4 21 99 revised jcb 7 13 99
