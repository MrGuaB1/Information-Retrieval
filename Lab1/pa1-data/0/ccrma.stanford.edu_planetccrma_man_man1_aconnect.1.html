aconnect aconnect 1 name aconnect alsa sequencer connection manager synopsis aconnect d options sender receiver aconnect i o options aconnect x description aconnect is a utility to connect and disconnect two existing ports on alsa sequencer system the ports with the arbitrary subscription per mission such as created by aseqview 1 can be connected to any midi device ports using aconnect for example to connect from port 64 0 to 65 0 run as follows aconnect 64 0 65 0 the connection is one way and the whole data to the sender port 64 0 is redirected to the receiver port 65 0 when another port eg 65 1 is attached to the same sender port the data is sent to both receiver ports for disconnection use d option aconnect d 64 0 65 0 the address can be given using the client's name aconnect external 0 emu8000 1 then the port 0 of the client matching with the string external is connected to the port 1 of the client matching with the emu8000 another function of aconnect is to list the present ports on the given condition the input ports which may become sender ports can be listed with i option aconnect i client 0 system type kernel 0 timer 1 announce client 64 external midi 0 type kernel 0 midi 0 0 similary to see the output ports use o flag you can remove all existing exported connections using x option this function is useful for terminating the alsa drivers because the mod ules with sequencer connections cannot be unloaded unless their connec tions are removed options connnection management d disconnect useful since the receiver port must use not necessarily own the specified queue t tick queue like r option but time stamps are converted to the current value of the given tick queue list ports i input list existing input readable ports this option is exclusive to o o output list existing output writable ports this option is exclusive to i l list list the current connection status the connected and connect ing ports from to each port are listed together the suffix flag ex means the connection is exclusive the suffix flag real and tick mean the connection includes real time and tick conversion on the listed queue respectively remove all connections x removeall remove all exported connections see also aseqnet 1 aseqview 1 author takashi iwai tiwai suse de august 31 2000 aconnect 1
