high sensitivity silver staining of sds page gels page 1 high sensitivity silver staining of sds page gels reagents 50 meoh 12 acetic acid and 100 l 37 paraformaldehyde solution per 200 ml fix solution 50 meoh wash solution 0.02 w v na2s2o3 pretreatment solution 0.2 w v agno3 silver solution 6 na2co3 and 4 ml 0.02 na2s2o3 100 l 37 paraformaldehyde solution per 200 ml develop solution 50 meoh 12 acetic acid stop solution 30 meoh 5 glycerol drying solution procedure 1 treat gel with the fix solution for at least 1 hour can be done overnight 200 ml of fix solution is enough for 2 4 minigels 2 wash the gel with the wash solution for 3 x 8 minutes 3 treat the gel with the pretreatment solution for exactly 1 minute the gel will float at first and so care should be taken to uniformly treat the gel by agitation 4 rinse the gel with milliq water for exactly 3 x 20 seconds 5 incubate the gel with the silver solution for 20 minutes 6 rinse the gel with milliq water for exactly 2 x 30 seconds 7 incubate the gel with the develop solution with agitation until the desired level of staining is achieved typically 2 10 minutes be sure to have the stop solution ready 8 stop the staining by treating the gel with the stop solution for at least 10 minutes 9 if you want to preserve the gel between sheets of porous plastic wash the gel with the wash solution for 2 x 10 minutes then incubate the gel with the drying solution for a maximum of 1 hour the glycerol will begin to leach out the silver after 1 2 hours notes 1 this procedure can reliably detect protein levels down to about 5 ng 2 all steps should be conducted with mechanical or manual swirling 3 for more control over the staining rate the develop solution can be removed from the gel when about 80 of the desired intensity is achieved the gel will continue to develop slowly with the remaining reagents trapped in the gel
