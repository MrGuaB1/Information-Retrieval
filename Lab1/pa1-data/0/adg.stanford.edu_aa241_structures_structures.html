aircraft structures aircraft structures why worry about structures structural design is of critical importance to aircraft safety but also plays a key role in aircraft cost and performance the airplane cost is related to the structural design in complex ways but typically aircraft end up costing $200 $500 per pound with sailplanes and military aircraft such as the b 2 demonstrating the spread in this figure the b 2 reportedly costs more per ounce than gold in addition to its direct impact on aircraft cost the aircraft structural weight affects performance every pound of airplane structure means one less pound of fuel when the take off weight is specified so in the range equation r v c l d ln w initial w final one might think of the first term representing the role of propulsion the second term aerodynamics and the third term structures in order to estimate the aircraft cost and empty weight we must estimate the weight of each of the components to do this we need to understand how these components structure is sized and to do this we need to estimate the loads that they will have to support this chapter is divided into three main sections which deal with each of these issues starting with a section on load prediction including placard diagrams and vn diagrams the chapter continues with a discussion of structural design including structural concepts critical design constraints and sizing methods the final section involves a conceptual design level method for estimating component weights and cg s
