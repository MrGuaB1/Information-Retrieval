contact engineering for organic semiconductor devices bao research group stanford university home people current alumni new member research research topics archived news wikilab lab members only publications press contact us visitors organic or carbon semiconductor devices are promising for both nanoelectronic and macroelectronic appli cations one of the major challenges to achieve high performance of these devices lies on understanding and improving the metal organic m o interface in this paper we present evidence and demonstration of fermi level depinning at the m o interface by inserting an ultrathin interfacial si3n4 insulator in between the m o contact behavior is successfully tuned from rectifying to quasi ohmic and to tunneling by varying the si3n4 thickness within 0 6 nm detailed physical mechanisms of fermi level pinning depinning responsible for the m o contact behavior are clarified based on a lumped dipole model and a simple depinning model this work sheds light on the fundamental understanding of the m o interface properties and also proves a practical engineering method of achieving low resistance quasi ohmic contacts for organic electronic devices zihong liu masaharu kobayashi bipul c paul zhenan bao yoshio nishi contact engineering for organic semiconductor devices via fermi level depinning at the metal organic interface physical review b 82 3 035311 2010 paper download http prb aps org abstract prb v82 i3 e035311 copyright 2009 2011 all rights reserved credits bao group benjamin tee soumen barmen logo by benjamin tee
