bio x stanford university mario diaz de la rosa chemical engineering bio x graduate student fellowships 2008 2009 professor andrew spakowitz chemical engineering the spakowitz lab examines how proteins find their target sites on dna a process central to proper cellular function and survival of particular interest is the role that dna conformation including supercoiling and higher order chromatin organization plays in this search they have developed a novel theoretical framework to address this phenomenon on linear supercoiled and nucleosomal dna and their predictions will be subsequently verified experimentally the resulting elucidation of the mechanisms behind target site localization will provide fundamental knowledge of gene regulation processes and the nature of protein dna interactions fellowships
