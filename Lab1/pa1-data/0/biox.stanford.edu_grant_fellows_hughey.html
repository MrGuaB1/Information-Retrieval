bio x stanford university jacob hughey bio x bioengineering graduate fellow 2007 professor markus covert bioengineering the goal of jacob's work is to provide a quantitative understanding of the intricate circuitry that controls how cells interact with their environment currently he is focusing on the tnf induced response of the nf b network which is crucially involved in cell proliferation and the innate immune response and is misregulated in many cancers he is using live cell imaging and mathematical modeling to explain how the dynamics of the network depend on tnf dose this research will lead to greater understanding of how cells sense and respond to the intensity of environmental signals fellowships
