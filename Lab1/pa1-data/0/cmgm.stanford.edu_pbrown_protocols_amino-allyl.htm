protocol for reverse transcription and amino allyl coupling of rna protocol for reverse transcription and amino allyl coupling of rna the following is a slight modification of a protocol developed by joe derisi ucsf and rosetta inpharmatics kirkland wa original document can be obtained at www microarrays org a rt reaction 1 to anneal primer mix 1 2 m g mrna with 5 ug of anchored oligo dt dt 20 vn operon hplc purified in a total volume of 18 m l one reaction for sample mrna and one for reference mrna oligo dt 5 m g of 2.5 m g m l 2 m l mrna water 1 2 m g 16 m l 2 heat to 70c for 10 minutes cool on ice for 5 minutes 3 add 11.6 m l of nucleotide mix to each of cy3 and cy5 reactions nucleotide mix for one reaction 5x rt buffer 50x dntp stock solution dtt superscript ii rt gibco rnasin gibco optional 0.1 m 200u m l 40u m l 6.0 m l 0.6 3.0 1.5 0.5 50x dntp stock solution using a 4 1 ratio aminoallyl dutp to dttp 10 m l each 100 mm datp dgtp dctp pharmacia 8 m l 100 mm aminoallyl dutp sigma a0410 2 m l 100 mm dttp dissolve 10 mg aminoallyl dutp in 170 m l water add approx 6.8 m l 1n naoh final ph is roughly 7.0 using ph paper altering the ratio of aminoallyl dutp to dttp will affect the incorporation of cy dye 1x dntp final concentration during labeling 500 m m each datp dctp dgtp 400 m m aminoallyl dutp 100 m m dttp 4 incubate reaction for 1 hour at 42c add additional 1 m l reverse transcriptase and continue incubation at 42c for an additional 1 hour b hydrolysis 1 degrade rna by addition of 15 m l of 0.1 n naoh incubate at 70c for 10 minutes 2 neutralize by addition of 15 m l 0.1 n hcl to continue with the amino allyl dye coupling procedure all tris must be removed from the reaction to prevent the monofunctional nhs ester cy dyes from coupling to free amine groups in solution 3 add 450 m l water to each reaction c cleanup add 500 m l neutralized diluted reaction mix to a microcon 30 filter amicon spin at 12g for 7 minutes discard flow through repeat process two more times refilling original filter with 450 m l water concentrate to 10 m l samples can be stored at 20c indefinitely d coupling add 0.5 m l 1m sodium bicarbonate ph 9.0 to 50 mm final check 1m stock solution periodically for fluctuations in ph monofunctional nhs ester cy3 pa23001 and cy5 dye pa25001 amersham is supplied as a dry pellet each tube is sufficient to label 10 reactions under normal conditions dissolve dry pellet in 20 m l dmso aliquot 2 m l into 10 single use tubes that are then dried in vacuo and store desiccated at 4c nhs ester conjugated cy dye is rapidly hydrolyzed in water therefore do not store in dmso or water decreasing the number of aliquots dye tube may increase your signal if you have already made aliquots of dye simply transfer your cdna in bicarbonate buffer 10.5 m l to the aliquot of dye alternatively dissolve cy dye in 10 ul dmso and add 1 m l of dye to 10.5 m l of the cdna reaction 10 dmso in the coupling reaction will not affect the chemical reaction aliquot unused dye and dry immediately incubate 1 hour at rt in the dark mix every 15 minutes e quenching and cleanup before combining cy3 and cy5 samples for hybridization unreactive nhs ester cy dye must be quenched to prevent cross coupling add 4.5 m l 4m hydroxylamine sigma let reaction incubate 15 minutes in the dark to remove unincorporated quenched cy dyes proceed with qia quick pcr purification kit qiagen method described below is as specified by manufacturer combine cy3 and cy5 reactions add 70 m l water add 500 m l buffer pb apply to qia quick column and spin at 13k for 30 60 seconds optional reapply flow though for optimal binding decant flow through add 750 m l buffer pe and spin 30 60 seconds decant flow through spin at high speed to dry column transfer spin unit to fresh eppendorf tube add 30 m l buffer eb to center of filter and allow to sit 3 minutes at rt spin at 13k rpm for 1 minute repeat elution step again with another 30 m l of buffer eb pool eluates add 20 m l 20 m g cot dna gibco add 420 te and apply to fresh microcon 30 filter spin 12000 g to a volume of 29 m l or less for 38 m l array hybridization 29 m l cdna probe in te 1 m l polya 10 m g sigma p9403 1 m l trna 10 m g gibco 15401 029 7 m l 20x ssc 1.2 m l sds 10 heat to 100c for 2 minutes let stand 15 minutes rt apply 38 m l to 40k array slight modifications to original protocol by mitch garber and anatoly urisman
