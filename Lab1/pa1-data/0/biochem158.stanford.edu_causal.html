biochem 158 258 causal gene variations biochemistry 158 258 genomics bioinformatics & medicine doug brutlag most of the snp variations associated with diseases in genome wide association studies do not cause the disease but instead these snps serve as genetic markers that are linked to genes which are involved in the disease ongoing research is attempting to sequence these genes in patients and in controls to find the actual variations in these genes that do in fact cause the disease for this assignment i would like you to choose an inherited disease simple or complex other than those mentioned in class huntingtons diabetes parkinsons cystic fibrosis sickle cell etc and describe what is known about the genetic variations that cause that disease you may search omim dbsnp dbvar hgmd and other database of genome variations that are associated with specific diseases to find an example of the kinds of mutations associated with the disease please describe how each of these variations cause the disease is it by 1 mutating the coding region of the protein 2 altering the gene expression by affecting the promoter 3 altering gene expression by affecting a transcription factor binding site 4 altering gene expression indirectly by mutating a transcription factor itself 5 altering copy number hence changing gene expression levels 6 altering other regulatory sites mirna targets 7 altering splice signals etc often there will be several types of mutations that can cause the disease please comment on all types that are known for your chosen disease cc dlb 2012
