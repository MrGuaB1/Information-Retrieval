wing weight wing weight the wing weight is taken as the sum of two terms a portion that varies directly with the wing area and a part that varies in proportion to the amount of material required to resist the applied bending loads this estimate is done statistically but is based on an index that is related to the weight of a fully stressed beam a derivation is given here wing weight breakdown dc 8 55 dc 10 10 stol study wing bending material 13115 21830 5983 wing spars webs stiffeners 2301 2822 1136 bending spars webs stiffners 15416 24652 7119 ribs 1463 2333 825 wing box weight 22718 33623 10387 total wing weight 33604 49298 20861 bending total 387 443 287 box total 676 682 498 detailed wing weight buildup item weight lbs bending material upper surface lower surface 13211 14250 shear material 4004 ribs and bulkheads 4570 leading edge 1910 trailing edge 1450 tips 125 slats and supports 3400 spoilers and supports 650 ailerons and supports 1305 flaps and supports 5960 wing fuselage fairing 960 wing fuselage attach 1000 main gear doors 160 exterior finish 190 primer and sealant 30 total 53175
