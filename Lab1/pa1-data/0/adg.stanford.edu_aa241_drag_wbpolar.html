wing body drag polar wing body drag polar computations here show the various components of drag as they vary with cl the program computes drag based on the methods of this chapter based on data for the current wing and fuselage before running this program be sure that you have entered the wing and fuselage geometry parameters on pages such as the wing analysis page the airfoil design page and the fuselage layout pages alternatively an entire input set may be entered in the data summary page of the appendix
