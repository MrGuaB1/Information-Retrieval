center on nanostructuring for efficient energy conversion overview cneec logo intranet research overview no single technology will solve the impending energy crisis ultimately a collection of different energy technologies must work in concert to efficiently and cleanly produce store and consume the 20 tw of power that humans around the globe will soon demand although there are many existing technologies for energy conversion devices most cannot provide renewable or sustainable solutions at scale because they are either too inefficient or too expensive it is thus critical to improve the efficiency of these devices most fittingly the overarching goal of cneec is to increase the efficiency of energy conversion devices by manipulating materials at the nanometer scale this involves developing the fabrication and characterization methodologies to understand how nanostructuring can optimize transport light absorption and reaction kinetics and thermodynamics in materials based on these fundamental advances we hope to demonstrate ways to improve the performance and efficiency of energy conversion devices such as photovoltaics fuel cells and batteries that rely on shared physical and chemical phenomena although the center emphasizes fundamental research we conduct our research with the motivation to improve efficiencies in energy conversion generate new knowledge and advance the progress of research deliver world class research based education to students and broad based training to leaders in academia industry and society facilitate technology transfer applying people and ideas to improve our society and our world the center is designed to make fundamental advances in cross cutting scientific theme areas which are likely to lead to step out improvements in device efficiencies in particular we rely on nanostructuring to generate each of these key physical properties high gradients high surface to volume ratios low dimensionality our research exploits these properties to tune thermodynamic equilibria and kinetic properties to vary photonic behavior through quantum confinement for efficient photon capture and to reduce distances for charge transport this involves learning how to manipulate sub nanometer particles namely electrons photons ions atoms and molecules by tuning material properties through nanostructuring to achieve our goals we organize our research activities under three themes or technical research groups trgs namely trg1 nanoscale control of thermodynamic potentials trg2 nanoscale control over photons and electrons trg3 nanoscale control in catalysis center on nanostructuring for efficient energy conversion is an energy frontier research center funded by the us department of energy office of science and office of basic energy sciences stanford home engineering home cneec home contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved cneec mission overview research faculty facilities tutorials get involved contact us
