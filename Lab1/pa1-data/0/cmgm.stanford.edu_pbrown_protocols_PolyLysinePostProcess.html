post processing of oligo arrays on polylysine coated slides post processing of oligo arrays on polylysine coated slides kate rubins draft version 01.25 06 use this for poly lysine slides only do not use on corning ultra gaps schotts amino silane or other non poly lysine surfaces rehydration shampoo mark boundaries of array on back of slide using diamond scriber prop slide between two tip boxes with lamp overhead and etch corners of array array will become invisible after post processing expose slides to 65mj of uv irradiation place slides inside face up on a paper towel set the stratalinker to energy and type in 650 make shampoo solution 66ml of filtered 20x ssc 8ml of 10 sds 332ml of distilled h20 preheat shampoo solution in microwave heat for 2 3 minutes and check to just above 60 c put solution in hybex chamber set at 60 c and let solution equilibrate with hybex lid closed for at least 10 minutes check solution temperature with a thermomether solution temperature should be 50 c set up a bath of 400ml h2o at room temperature next to the hybex set up a bath of 400ml 95 ethanol at room temperature next to the hybex dunk slides into shampoo solution at 50 c plunge for 15 seconds close the hybex cover and incubate for 5 min check the temperature during the incubation transfer to 400ml h2o for a few seconds to rinse transfer to 400ml 95 etoh for a few seconds spin slides at 500 rpm 5 min room temperature quickly and evenly transfer the slides to the centrifuge to prevent streaking place arrays in metal slide rack every other slot be sure the rack is bent slightly inwards in the middle or else the slides may run into each other while shaking succinic anhydride blocking measure out 15ml sodium borate in a 50 ml conical tube measure out 5.5 g succinic anhydride into a conical tube use fresh stock no older than 3 months prepare shaker in the fume hood put 500ml glass chamber with metal top on shaker place a 500ml beaker with a stir bar on a stirring block in the hood prepare a second 500ml glass chamber with 95 etoh prepare a third 500ml glass chamber with room temperature h20 dissolve 5.5 g succinic anhydride in approx 325 350 ml 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone use fresh stock no older than one month rapid addition of reagent is crucial immediately after the last flake of the succinic anhydride dissolves add the 15 ml sodium borate immediately after sodium borate solution mixes in pour solution into empty slide chamber plunge slide rack rapidly and evenly in solution vigorously shake up and down for a few seconds making sure slides never leave solution mix on orbital shaker 15 20 min gently plunge slide rack in room temperature h20 for 60 seconds plunge slide rack 5x in 95 ethanol centrifuge slides and rack for 5 min 500 rpm load slides quickly and evenly onto the carriers to avoid streaking use arrays immediately or store in slide box
