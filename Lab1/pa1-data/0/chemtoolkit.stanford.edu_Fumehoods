fume hood use laboratory chemical safety toolkit home fume hood use summary all chemicals should be handled in a laboratory hood whenever possible chemicals that have high acute toxicity are carcinogens or are reproductive toxins must be handled in a laboratory fume hood except where there is only a very low risk of exposure eg use of minimal quantities in a closed system as a general rule use a hood or other local ventilation device when working with any appreciably volatile substance or material easily dispersible in air ie dust having a permissible exposure limit of less than 50 ppm or 0.25 mg m3 for particulate matter what to do how to do this follow proper safety fume practices ensure the fume hood is labeled with a certification date of less than one year prior verify sufficient inward airflow before using a hood by checking the hood's airflow indicator report any problems to pi lab supervisor and facilities operations at x3 2281 in som e&m at x3 5555 maintain hood sash at or below the maximum height indicated by an arrow on the side of the fume hood close the hood sash when not working in the hood avoid rapid movements at the face of the hood as they tend to create competing air currents and reduce the ability of the hood to contain air contaminants equipment used in hoods should be placed securely on blocks to allow air to flow under and around the equipment keep chemical sources and equipment at least six inches away from the face or rear of the hood minimize equipment and chemical storage placed in the hood to avoid dead air spaces or eddies and to prevent blocking back baffles for operations involving heating or volatilizing perchloric acid use perchloric acid fume hoods these hoods contain water spray systems to wash down the interior of the hood ducting fan and stack to prevent accumulation of explosive perchlorate crystalline material fumehood safety video back to top search content content introduction getting started your responsibilities pi laboratory supervisor laboratory personnel safety training prior approval and special precautions medical surveillance safe lab practices creating standard operating procedures lab safety basics fume hood use personal protective equipment chemical storage labeling & inventory restricted chemicals & high risk procedures laboratory inspections chemical waste disposal emergencies spills or exposures emergencies spills or exposures health threatening non health threatening small spills local clean up incident reporting reference info chemical hazard classes carcinogens compressed gases corrosive materials cryogenic liquids flammable and combustible liquids highly acutely toxic chemicals highly reactive unstable materials irritants reproductive toxins sensitizers restricted chemicals laboratory chemical safety sheets material safety data sheets stanford lab safety sheets toxnet 2007 stanford university all rights reserved
