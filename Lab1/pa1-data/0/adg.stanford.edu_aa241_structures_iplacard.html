placard diagram interactive placard diagram the placard diagram for your aircraft is shown above the input parameters may be specified here and are defined as follows init cruise altitude initial cruise altitude ft cruise mach design cruise mach number altitude at vc altitude for which the airplane is to be capable of operating at the design mach number ft note that the vc altitude also known as the knee of the placard determines the maximum dynamic pressure for which the aircraft is to be designed typical values for transonic aircraft are in the 26000 28000 ft range for sst's the placard is often more complex but one should choose the vc altitude here to produce a reasonable low altitude maximum speed the concorde for example has a vc speed of about 400 kts eas up to 30000 ft a cruise mach number of 2.0 and a vc altitude of 57000 ft leads to this value of vc the concorde actually allows higher q's above 32000 ft but for our calculations of gust loads this simpler placard will suffice
