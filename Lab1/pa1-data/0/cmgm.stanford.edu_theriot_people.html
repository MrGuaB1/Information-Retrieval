theriot lab people questions send an email to the webmaster at keep in mind though that none of us are physicians for most medically related information see the listeria and shigella links above principal investigator contacting us our fearless leader julie theriot is an assistant professor in the department of biochemistry and department of microbiology and immunology stanford school of medicine lab phone number 650 723 6220 theriot lab dept of biochemistry stanford university stanford ca 94305 current lab members anna brotcke ph d student annie studies the pathogenesis of intracellular bacteria aretha fiebig postdoctoral fellow aretha is interested dynamic processes in bacterial cell biology in particular chromosome segregation species with more than one chromosome aretha is also investigating species specific differences in motility of intracellular pathogens matthew footer research associate matt is using biochemistry to probe the interactions among the proteins required for actin based motility he is also pursuing new mechanisms for man made actin based motility via creation of asymetrically coated particles karine gibbs ph d student karine studies the generation of subcellular spatial asymmetries in bacterial proteins kinneret keren postdoctoral fellow kinneret investigates the biophysics of cell motility catherine lacayo ph d student catherine investigates the motile behavior of listeria monocytogenesas a function of its subcellular location zachary pincus ph d student zach is interested in approaches to automatically analyzing and categorizing image data he is also interested in relating image data to the outputs and parameters of computational models of cellular processes susanne rafelski ph d student susanne wants to understand the mechanism of listeria motility initiation she is interested in how acta and actin surface distribution effect initiation dynamics martijn van duijn postdoctoral fellow martijn will study the crawling of cells over surfaces structured with photolithographic techniques also he will try to reconstruct cell crawling with purified proteins in large lipid vesicles cyrus wilson ph d student cyrus is quantitatively investigating how molecular and mechanical processes across multiple scales integrate to produce cell motility patricia yam ph d student patricia uses fish epithelial keratocytes to investigate events that occur when the cells shift from a non motile to a motile state she is also investigating actin dynamics in cells initiating motility and undergoing steady state motility nathalie dye ph d student people we really like who hang out here a lot denise monack ph d student denise is a member of the falkow group and is interested in what it takes to be an intracellular pathogen with a combination of genetic and cell biological techniques she studies the shigella life cycle and its protease dependent mechanism for mediating actin based motility alexander van oudenaarden assistant professor mit alexander a recent post doctoral fellow in steve boxer's lab studies the physics of brownian ratchets using computer modelling microfabrication and video microscopy he studies actin based force generation and the spontaneous acquisition of asymmetry in actin based motility diana rios cardona ph d student diana's is a ph d student in jim ferrell's lab her research interest is for now cloning and characterization of g protein coupled receptors of xenopus oocytes julie sneddon ph d student julie is a graduate student in pat brown's lab interested in the cellular response to listeria infection alumni paula giardini ph d fred soo ph d rachael ream ph d david baldwin ph d dan fletcher ph d jennifer robbins ph d chloe chhor md yaroslaw bazaliy ph d lisa cameron ph d john lyo md sandy mccallum ph d david fung ph d mitch sanders ph d barrett simms
