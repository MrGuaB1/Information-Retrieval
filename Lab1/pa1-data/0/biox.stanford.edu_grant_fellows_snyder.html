bio x stanford university rebecca snyder bio x bioengineering graduate fellow 2009 rebecca plans to pursue research in orthopedic tissue engineering by studying the effects of scaffold material properties on the differentiation of stem cells by utilizing her knowledge of the materials paradigm and biological response pathways she intends to incorporate varying materials within a single tissue scaffold to promote heterogeneous differentiation in response to biomechanical signals this work can provide a construct that closely mimics the extensive collaboration of various cell types within a given biologic space such detailed study of host tissue interactions could impact the development of devices ranging from pacemakers to orthopedic implants fellowships
