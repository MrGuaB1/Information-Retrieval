thick airfoil design thick airfoil design the difficulty with thick airfoils is that the minimum pressure is decreased due to thickness this results in a more severe adverse pressure gradient and the need to start recovery sooner if the maximum thickness point is specified the section with maximum thickness must recover from a given point with the steepest possible gradient this is just the sort of problem addressed by liebeck in connection with maximum lift the thickest possible section has a boundary layer just on the verge of separation throughout the recovery the thickest section at re 10 million is 57 thick but of course it will separate suddenly with any angle of attack
