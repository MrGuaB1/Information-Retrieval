supersonic drag supersonic drag as the mach number increases further the drag associated with compressibility continues to increase for most commercial aircraft this limits the economically feasible speed if one is willing to pay the price for the drag associated with shock waves one can increase the flight speed to mach numbers for which the above analysis is not appropriate in supersonic flow an aircraft has lift and volume dependent wave drag in addition to the viscous friction and vortex drag terms this approximate expression was derived by rt jones sears and haack for the minimum drag of a supersonic body with fixed lift span length and volume the expression holds for low aspect ratio surfaces notice that unlike the subsonic case the supersonic drag depends strongly on the airplane length l this section describes some of the approaches to computing supersonic wave drag components including wave drag due to volume wave drag due to lift program for computing wing wave drag
