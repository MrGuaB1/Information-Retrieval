lab safety basics laboratory chemical safety toolkit home lab safety basics summary below are general safe laboratory practices for personnel working in laboratories where hazardous chemicals are used and or stored understanding hazards know the hazards of the chemicals you are working with consult the material safety data sheet msds or other appropriate references prior to using a chemical with which you are unfamiliar assume that unknown materials are toxic and that a mixture is more toxic than its most toxic compound minimize exposure to all chemicals regardless of toxicity or their familiarity most laboratory chemicals have not been fully characterized with respect to their toxicity as such it is prudent to implement procedures that will minimize the likelihood of exposure skin contact should always be avoided avoid inhalation of chemicals never sniff to test chemicals emergencies know the location and proper use of emergency equipment such as safety showers fire extinguishers and fire alarms engineering controls minimize chemical exposure through consistent and proper use of laboratory fume hoods glove boxes or other ventilated enclosures personal protective equipment at minimum wear safety glasses and appropriate street clothing ie long pants and closed toed shoes for entering a laboratory additionally wear laboratory coat when hazardous chemicals are in use remove gloves when leaving the laboratory so as not to contaminate doorknobs etc working alone and unattended operations consult with your principal investigator if planning to work alone or running an unattended operation communicate with others in the building when working alone in the laboratory let them know when you arrive and leave avoid working alone in the laboratory when performing high risk operations use cautious judgment when leaving unattended operations i post signs to communicate appropriate warnings and precautions ii anticipate potential equipment and facility failures and iii provide containment for release of hazardous chemicals avoid ingesting chemicals do wash your hands frequently to minimize chemical exposure through ingestion and direct contact with the skin always wash hands before eating drinking smoking or applying cosmetics don t use mouth suction for pipetting or siphoning consume or store food beverages or apply cosmetics in laboratories including refrigerators and cold rooms or chemical storage areas labeling label all chemical containers with the identity of the contents avoid abbreviations acronyms hazard warning and chemical concentration information should also be included transporting use appropriate safety carriers secondary containment when transporting chemicals either inside or outside of the building lab cleanliness keep work area clean and uncluttered clean up work area on completion of an operation or at the end of the day cold warm rooms as most controlled temperature rooms ie cold warm rooms lack mechanical exhaust 100 recirculated air storage and use of toxic substances flammable solvents corrosive acids asphyxiants such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide and open flames eg bunsen burners are strictly prohibited back to top search content content introduction getting started your responsibilities pi laboratory supervisor laboratory personnel safety training prior approval and special precautions medical surveillance safe lab practices creating standard operating procedures lab safety basics fume hood use personal protective equipment chemical storage labeling & inventory restricted chemicals & high risk procedures laboratory inspections chemical waste disposal emergencies spills or exposures emergencies spills or exposures health threatening non health threatening small spills local clean up incident reporting reference info chemical hazard classes carcinogens compressed gases corrosive materials cryogenic liquids flammable and combustible liquids highly acutely toxic chemicals highly reactive unstable materials irritants reproductive toxins sensitizers restricted chemicals laboratory chemical safety sheets material safety data sheets stanford lab safety sheets toxnet 2007 stanford university all rights reserved
