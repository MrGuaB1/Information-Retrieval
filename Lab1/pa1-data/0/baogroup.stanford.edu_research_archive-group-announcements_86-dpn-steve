parallel fabrication of dpn electrodes bao research group stanford university home people current alumni new member research research topics archived news wikilab lab members only publications press contact us visitors this article presents a novel application of using dip pen nanolithography dpn to fabricate au electrodes concurrently in a high throughput fashion through an etch resist we have fabricated 26 pairs of electrodes where cleanly etched electrode architectures along with a high degree of feature size controllability and tip to tip uniformity were observed moreover electrode gaps in the sub 100 nm regime have been successfully fabricated conductivity measurements of multiple electrodes in the array were all comparable to that of bulk au confirming the reliability and the low resistance property of the electrodes finally as a demonstration of electrode functionality swnt devices were fabricated and the electrical properties of an swnt device were measured hence our experimental results validate dpn as an effective tool in generating high quality electrodes in a parallel manner with mild simple processing steps at a relatively low cost article link http pubs acs org doi abs 10.1021 2fla904170w copyright 2009 2011 all rights reserved credits bao group benjamin tee soumen barmen logo by benjamin tee
