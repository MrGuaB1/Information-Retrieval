carcinogens laboratory chemical safety toolkit home carcinogens click here for the general use standard operating procedure for carcinogens summary the risks associated with the use of laboratory chemicals must be well understood prior to their use in an experiment as many chemicals have multiple hazards ensure to review the safety guidance for all hazard classes that may apply definition carcinogens are chemicals or physical agents that cause cancer or tumor development typically after repeated or chronic exposure their effects may only become evident after a long latency period and may cause no immediate harmful effects further cal osha 8 ccr 5194 defines a select carcinogen as a substance or agent that meets one of the following criteria it is regulated by cal osha as a carcinogen it is listed under the category known to be carcinogens in the annual report on carcinogens published by the national toxicology program ntp latest edition or it is listed under group 1 carcinogenic to humans by the international agency for research on cancer iarc it is listed in either group 2a or 2b by iarc or under the category reasonably anticipated to be carcinogens by ntp and causes statistically significant tumor incidence in experimental animals in accordance with any of the following criteria after inhalation exposure of 6 7 hours per day 5 days per week for a significant portion of a lifetime to dosages of less than 10 mg m3 after repeated skin application of less than 300 mg kg of body weight per week or after oral dosages of less than 50 mg kg of body weight per day important lab personnel should recognize that many chemicals have not been thoroughly assessed for their carcinogenicity prior to selecting chemicals for use in laboratory procedures researchers should be familiar with the specific classes of compounds and functional group types that have been correlated to carcinogenic activity examples carcinogens used in stanford university laboratories include methylene chloride benzene formaldehyde and acrylonitrile back to top search content content introduction getting started your responsibilities pi laboratory supervisor laboratory personnel safety training prior approval and special precautions medical surveillance safe lab practices creating standard operating procedures lab safety basics fume hood use personal protective equipment chemical storage labeling & inventory restricted chemicals & high risk procedures laboratory inspections chemical waste disposal emergencies spills or exposures emergencies spills or exposures health threatening non health threatening small spills local clean up incident reporting reference info chemical hazard classes carcinogens compressed gases corrosive materials cryogenic liquids flammable and combustible liquids highly acutely toxic chemicals highly reactive unstable materials irritants reproductive toxins sensitizers restricted chemicals laboratory chemical safety sheets material safety data sheets stanford lab safety sheets toxnet 2007 stanford university all rights reserved
