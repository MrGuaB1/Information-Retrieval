about lift and cl distributions about lift and cl distributions the distribution of lift on the wing affects the wing performance in many ways the lift per unit length l y may be plotted from the wing root to the tip as shown below in this case the distribution is roughly elliptical in general the lift goes to zero at the wing tip the area under the curve is the total lift the section lift coefficient is related to the section lift by so that if we know the lift distribution and the planform shape we can find the cl distribution the lift and lift coefficient distributions are directly related by the chord distribution here are some examples the lift and cl distributions can be divided into so called basic and additional lift distributions this division allows one to examine the lift distributions at a couple of angles of attack and to infer the lift distribution at all other angles this is especially useful in the process of wing design the distribution of lift can be written here the distributions la and lb are the wing lift distributions with no twist at cl 1 and with unit twist at zero lift respectively the first term cl la is called the additional lift it is the lift distribution that is added by increasing the total wing lift theta lb is called the basic lift distribution and is the lift distribution at zero lift why is this useful consider the following example we can use the data at these two angles of attack to learn a great deal about the wing from the expression above or the additional lift distribution cl la may be interpreted graphically as shown below the additional lift coefficient distribution at cl 1.0 is plotted below note that it rises upward toward the tip this is indicative of a wing with a very low taper ratio or a wing with sweep back the basic lift distribution is negative near the tip implying that the wing has washout
