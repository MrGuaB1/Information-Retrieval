the spectral difference scheme the spectral difference scheme some theory subsonic inviscid flow figure 1 shows a solution of the euler equations for flow around the naca0012 airfoil using the order spectral difference scheme at flow conditions and zero angle of attack mach number contours are shown on the left while the figure on the right compares the entropy error with results from a finite volume scheme which employs the cusp scheme with a slip data reconstruction 7 and uses the triangles as control volumes figure 1 validation of the spectral difference method subsonic flow around the naca0012 airfoil note that the entropy error for the spectral difference scheme with 15360 dof is roughly equal to the entropy error of the finite volume scheme with approximately dof transonic supersonic inviscid flow some theory the famous mach reflection case the shocks are very well captured using a local projection type limiter very similar to the one proposed for discontinuous galerkin methods viscous flow a validation for low reynolds number flow can be seen below figure 2 validation of the spectral difference method subsonic viscous flow around the naca0012 airfoil left spectral difference 3rd order right computational mesh the 3rd order sd scheme resolves the flow even on this coarse mesh this is not the case for a 2nd order finite volume scheme as is shown below which clearly demonstrates the superiority of the higher order scheme figure 2 subsonic viscous flow around the naca0012 airfoil finite volume schemes 2nd order right computational mesh georg may 2006 02 23
