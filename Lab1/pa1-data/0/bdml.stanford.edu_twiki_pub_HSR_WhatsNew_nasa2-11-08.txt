greetings from nasa houston while at nasa yong lae and i asked toby martin about the quantum tunneling current qtc skin that they have used on robonaut they have been using sheets from the same british company that supplies materials to shadow robotics in appearance stiffness and texture it is rather like the pdms sheets that aaron parness has been spinning for his microwedges the tunneling effect gives an approximately logarithmic conduction rate with pressure they use it on a flexible printed circuit with closely spaced adjacent electrodes for voltage and ground on pressure the current takes a u shaped path between adjacent pads on the printed circuit they do not try to bond the pads to the skin eg with conductive epoxy nor have they tried to pattern a circuit directly onto the skin eg by sputtering of vapor deposition they found a supplier who will make them small quantities of very precise very flexible double sided printed circuits which they wrap around the robonaut fingers toby could not remember the supplier maybe minco cirexx but the circuits are certainly higher resolution and quality that will provancher was able to fabricate in my lab toby says the circuit skin combination gives a substantially better more repeatable less hystersis sensor than the fsrs that they used previously they cover the qtc skin with an outer skin of what looks like neoprene or urethane for durability to obtain better sensitivity at light pressures they place glass beads directly over where the contact pads are to increase the local pressure cheers mark c
