spatial resolution issues page 1 spatial resolution issues first level db dt sar vs normal mode first level allows more sar and more db dt still within fda safe limits but higher db dt increases chance of pns first level allows us to go faster esp epi more slices per tr faster diffusion gradients fatsat vs spectral spatial how to adjust page 2 fat sat vs spectral spatial when chemsat is none a spectral spatial pulse is used this is faster but limits minimum slice thickness to 2.9 mm first level sar or 3.6 mm normal sar fatsat allows thinner slices but slower fewer slices in same tr increased chance of fat ghost artifacts page 3 2.9 mm tr 2s whole brain page 4 2.5 mm tr 2s most brain page 5 2.0 mm tr 2s much brain page 6 1.5 mm tr 2s te 35 page 7 1.5 mm tr 2s te 30 page 8 page 9 cni wiki
