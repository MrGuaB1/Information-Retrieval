antony jameson's home page dept of aeronautics & astronautics flo codes this series of codes has been developed since 1970 for progressively more complex models of fluid flow more complex geometric configurations and more advanced algorithms some highlights are listed below 1970 flo 1 2 solution of 2d potential flow by conformal mapping syn 1 solution of inverse problem by conformal mapping lighthill's method 1971 3 flo 6 2d transonic potential flow rotated difference scheme 1975 flo 22 first transonic potential flow solution for a swept wing co author d caughey first used for the wing design of the canadair challenger later marketed as xflo 22 by the dutch nlr still in use today at boeing long beach 1977 flo 27 3d potential flow in general grid with trilinear isoparametric elements incorporated in boeing a488 software 1979 flo 36 multigrid solution of 2d transonic potential flow in 3 10 06 sec on ibm t30 laptop 1981 flo 57 solution of 3d euler equations used worldwide derivatives include nasa's tlns3d lockheed's team code british aerospace's codes ej30 ej65 dornier ikarus code 1983 flo 82 multigrid solution of 2d euler equations in 25 50 steps 1985 flo 67 multigrid solution of 3d euler equations in 25 50 steps 1985 airplane first solution of euler equations for a complete aircraf tetrahedral mesh used by mcdonald douglas md 11 nasa hsct mitsubishi eads basis of their current software airplane+ 1988 flo 97 107 cell vertex and cell centered schemes for 3d navier stokes equations 1989 syn 36 airfoil design in transonic potential flow via control theory 1991 uflo 82 87 dual timestepping scheme for unsteady flow used in tflo code for stanford's asci project 1993 5 syn 87 88 wing design by control theory using 3d euler equations 1997 syn 107 wing design by control theory using 3d navier stokes equations 2001 flo 82 sgs textbook multigrid solution of 2d and 3d euler equations flo 88 sgs 3 5 steps with nonlinear symmetric gauss seidel scheme 2003 synplane aerodynamic design of complete aircraft using control theory with tetrahedral mesh 2003 flo 3xx viscous flow solution on arbitrary polyhedral meshes syn 3xx aerodynamic design of general configurations in viscous flow on arbitrary meshes the names flo and syn were adopted because fortran names were restricted to 6 characters and jameson wanted to allow for 3 digit numbers
