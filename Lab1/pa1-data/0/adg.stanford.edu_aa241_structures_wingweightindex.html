wing weight index derivation derivation of the wing weight index consider a section of a wing structural box assumed symmetrical about a neutral axis if we consider only the bending stress in the wing upper and lower skins then the bending moment is related to the normal stress by m b 2 s a 2 t 2 sa t 2 where m b is the bending moment at the spanwise section under consideration t is the section thickness and a is the total cross sectional area of the stressed material if the skins are carrying a given allowable stress then s allow 2 m b y ta or a 2 m b y t s allow the weight of this material is then w b 2 o o b 2 0 ra dy 4 r s t c o o b 2 0 m b c dy where an average value of t c is used if the wing has a linear chord distribution then c y s b 2 1 l 1 h 1 l where h is the dimensionless span statio 2y b the wing bending moment is related to the lift by m b y o o b 2 y l y y dy l total b o o b 2 y l l b avg y dy combining these expressions leads to w b 4 r s t c l total b o o b 2 0 o y b 2 l l b avg y c dy dy 2 rb 3 l total ss t c o o 1 0 o h 1 l l b avg h 1 l 1 h 1 l dh dh the double integral may be evaluated for a given shape of the lift distribution when a simple shape is assumed the effect of sweep is added and the total lift is set equal to the ultimate load factor times a sort of average between zero fuel weight and maximum take off weight we obtain w b  rb 3 n ult o zfw tow 1 2l ss t c 1 l cos 2 l the actual wing weight will be larger than this because the material is not fully stressed and because shear material is also needed we correlate actual wing weights to this index to produce a wing weight estimate
