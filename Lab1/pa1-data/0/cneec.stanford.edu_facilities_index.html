center on nanostructuring for efficient energy conversion facilities cneec logo intranet facilities the majority of cneec research is performed at stanford university and benefit from a variety of shared facilities on campus in addition to the specialized capabilities in individual faculty laboratories stanford provides user facilities that are accessible to all researchers including those working on cneec programs nanoscale fabrication and lithography capabilities offered by the stanford nanofabrication facility provides open access to a variety of advanced tools and techniques for patterning etching and thin film deposition nanoscale characterization is offered by the stanford nanocharacterization laboratory which provides a battery of advanced tools and instruments for structural surface compositional and microscopic analyses new acquisitions including a high spatial resolution secondary ion mass spectrometer nanosims aberration corrected transmission electron microscope and the electron energy loss spectrometer eels also provide unique capabilities cneec also benefits from the facilities and specialized capabilities at our partner institutions namely the carnegie institution for biomimetic and photosynthesis research hrl for battery research and the center for atomic scale materials design at the technical university of denmark on computational modeling center on nanostructuring for efficient energy conversion is an energy frontier research center funded by the us department of energy office of science and office of basic energy sciences stanford home engineering home cneec home contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved cneec research faculty facilities tutorials get involved contact us
