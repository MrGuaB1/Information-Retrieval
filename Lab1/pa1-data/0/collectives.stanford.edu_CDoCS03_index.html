cdocs 2003 collectives and the design of complex systems workshop on collectives and the design of complex systems program chairs kagan tumer david wolpert ilan kroo stanford university stanford california august 25 28 2003 description purpose of workshop contact information important dates register on line location abstracts schedule participants description the advent of extremely cheap computing is quickly leading to a world filled with large artificial distributed systems of self motivated components this is in addition to the many naturally occuring systems of this character very often we have performance criteria by which we rank the dynamic behavior of such systems eg gdp growth in a human economy stock price of a corporation percentage of available free energy used by an ecosystem total throughput in a data network total scientific information gathered by a constellation of deployables etc following up on the success of cdocs 2002 this workshop will bring together leading researchers from the physics economics biology engineering and computer science communities to help cement the foundation of the field studying such systems this field studies two broad problems 1 the forward problem concerns understanding the process by which the structure underlying the local interactions of a collective affects the overall performance criteria 2 the inverse problem arises when we wish to design the structure of the system to optimize its behavior according to the pre specified performance criteria purpose of the workshop and connection to other fields this workshop will contain several short courses in addition to invited talks contributed talks and poster sessions generated from submitted papers the aim of these short courses is to establish a common language and background for workshop attendees they will cover the relationship between the study of collectives and the following more established disciplines i mechanism design game theory ii statistical physics econophysics iii optimization engineering design iv collective intelligence reinforcement learning it is intended that a book of the tutorials and selected works from the workshop will be published lectures and talks will be given by rob axtell yaneer bar yam eric bonabeau aviv bergman josh epstein tad hogg neil johnson ilan kroo sanjay lall david parkes jordan pollack kagan tumer david wolpert zoltan toraczkai submissions are solicited especially though not exclusively from the following fields control of chaos nonlinear control nonlinear time series analysis computational economics mechanism design evolutionary game theory statistical physics population biology multiagent systems distributed adaptive control reinforcement learning organizers contact information kagan tumer nasa ames research center mail stop 269 4 moffett field ca 94035 1000 kagan ptolemy arc nasa gov http ic arc nasa gov kagan david wolpert nasa ames research center mail stop 269 2 moffett field ca 94035 1000 dhw ptolemy arc nasa gov http ic arc nasa gov dhw ilan kroo dept of aero astro stanford university stanford ca 94305 kroo stanford edu location the workshop will be held on the stanford university campus an easy drive from either san jose or san fransisco airports important dates the due date for submissions is june 6 2003 to one of organizers listed below please indicate preference for either a talk or a poster and have submission be in either postscript or pdf format there is no set page limit per se we will make the drafts available to the workshop participants prior to the workshop final contributions based on comments from participants and discussions at the workshop will be due approximately one month after the workshop if you have any questions please contact kagan tumer or ilan kroo or david wolpert by email
