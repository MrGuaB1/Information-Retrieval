highly acutely toxic chemicals laboratory chemical safety toolkit home highly acutely toxic chemicals click here for the general use standard operating procedure for highly acutely toxic chemicals summary the risks associated with the use of laboratory chemicals must be well understood prior to their use in an experiment as many chemicals have multiple hazards ensure to review the safety guidance for all hazard classes that may apply definition chemicals that have a high level of acute toxicity have the ability to cause harmful local and systemic effects after a single exposure many of these chemicals may also be characterized as a toxic gas nsar select toxin corrosive irritant or sensitizer a highly toxic material is considered a chemical falling within any of the following categories a chemical with a median lethal dose ld50 of 50 mg or less per kg of body weight when administered orally to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 gm each a chemical with a median lethal dose ld50 of 200 mg or less per kg of body weight when administered by continuous contact for 24 hours or less if death occurs within 24 hours with the bare skin of albino rabbits weighing between 2 and 3 kg each a chemical that has a median lethal concentration lc50 in air of 5000 ppm by volume or less of gas or vapor or 50 mg per liter or less of mist fume or dust when administered by continuous inhalation for 1 hour or less if death occurs within 1 hour to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 gm each examples highly acutely toxic chemicals used in stanford university laboratories include acrolein arsine nitrogen dioxide back to top search content content introduction getting started your responsibilities pi laboratory supervisor laboratory personnel safety training prior approval and special precautions medical surveillance safe lab practices creating standard operating procedures lab safety basics fume hood use personal protective equipment chemical storage labeling & inventory restricted chemicals & high risk procedures laboratory inspections chemical waste disposal emergencies spills or exposures emergencies spills or exposures health threatening non health threatening small spills local clean up incident reporting reference info chemical hazard classes carcinogens compressed gases corrosive materials cryogenic liquids flammable and combustible liquids highly acutely toxic chemicals highly reactive unstable materials irritants reproductive toxins sensitizers restricted chemicals laboratory chemical safety sheets material safety data sheets stanford lab safety sheets toxnet 2007 stanford university all rights reserved
