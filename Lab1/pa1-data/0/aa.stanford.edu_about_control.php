department of aeronautics & astronautics aeroastro logo control and navigation the global positioning system gps is used by over 500 million people in a breathtaking variety of applications and benefits it's used in telecommunications in cell phones and in navigation of planes boats and cars its use has become so ubiquitous that most people would not realize its importance unless it failed we are proud of the important role that stanford has played in the development of the gps and its applications the gps lab at stanford works with the federal aviation agency navy air force nasa and coast guard to pioneer systems that augment the gps and galileo these augmentations broadcast differential corrections to improve accuracy provide error bounds in real time and mitigate radio frequency interference the gps lab has helped in the development of the local area augmentation system laas a ground based augmentation to gps that provides a very precise navigation service for airports and surrounding areas researchers at stanford have also been instrumental in the development of the wide area augmentation system waas using waas aircraft can access nearly 1700 runways in poor weather conditions with minimums as low as 200 feet it also supports millions of land and marine users the aerospace robotics lab works to improve the performance of robots on land in the sea in the sky and in space it uses feedback control integrated sensing systems and task level autonomy validated with actual robots robots can reach places that humans can not reach and do things that humans can not do but the problems lie in navigating to exact spots whether underwater or millions of miles away while modeling the aerodynamics involved and having the flexibility to achieve precise control of the robots multiple manipulators despite uncertainty about the local conditions the networked systems and control lab has been developing robust control technologies for distributed systems where multiple units interact to coordinate global behavior such as in formation flight another area of research is model reduction the construction of simplified models for complex physical systems for simulation analysis and control design 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved about aeroastro computational based design control and navigation space systems structural health monitoring sustainable aviation faculty faculty search research labs curriculum student research admissions & financial aid events affiliates membership giving to aa links contact us
