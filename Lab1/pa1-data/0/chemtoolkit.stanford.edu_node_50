flammable and combustible liquids laboratory chemical safety toolkit home flammable and combustible liquids click here for the general use standard operating procedure for flammable and combustible liquids summary the risks associated with the use of laboratory chemicals must be well understood prior to their use in an experiment as many chemicals have multiple hazards ensure to review the safety guidance for all hazard classes that may apply definition for the purposes of laboratory safety both flammable and combustible liquids are considered fire hazards flammable liquids have a flash point of less than 100 f and combustible liquids have a flash point of between 100 200 f per cal osha 8 ccr 5191 flammable material definitions are as follows 1 aerosol flammable means an aerosol that when tested by the method described in 16 cfr 1500.45 yields a flame projection exceeding 18 inches at full valve opening or a flashback a flame extending back to the valve at any degree of valve opening 2 gas flammable means a a gas that at ambient temperature and pressure forms a flammable mixture with air at a concentration of 13 percent by volume or less or b a gas that at ambient temperature and pressure forms a range of flammable mixtures with air greater than 12 percent by volume regardless of the lower explosive limit 3 liquid flammable means any liquid having a flashpoint below 100 f 37.8 c except any mixture having components with flashpoints of 100 f 37.8 c or higher the total of which make up 99 percent or more of the total volume of the mixture 4 solid flammable means a solid other than a blasting agent or explosive as defined in 29 cfr 1910.109 a that is liable to cause fire through friction absorption of moisture spontaneous chemical change or retained heat from manufacturing or processing or which can be ignited readily and when ignited burns so vigorously and persistently as to create a serious hazard a chemical shall be considered to be a flammable solid if when tested by the method described in 16 cfr 1500.44 it ignites and burns with a self sustained flame at a rate greater than one tenth of an inch per second along its major axis examples flammable and combustible liquids used in stanford university laboratories include acetone methyl alcohol acetic acid toluene back to top search content content introduction getting started your responsibilities pi laboratory supervisor laboratory personnel safety training prior approval and special precautions medical surveillance safe lab practices creating standard operating procedures lab safety basics fume hood use personal protective equipment chemical storage labeling & inventory restricted chemicals & high risk procedures laboratory inspections chemical waste disposal emergencies spills or exposures emergencies spills or exposures health threatening non health threatening small spills local clean up incident reporting reference info chemical hazard classes carcinogens compressed gases corrosive materials cryogenic liquids flammable and combustible liquids highly acutely toxic chemicals highly reactive unstable materials irritants reproductive toxins sensitizers restricted chemicals laboratory chemical safety sheets material safety data sheets stanford lab safety sheets toxnet 2007 stanford university all rights reserved
