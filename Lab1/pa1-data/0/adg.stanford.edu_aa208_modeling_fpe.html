full potential equation full potential equation the full potential equation is derived from the assumption of irrotational flow and the equations of continuity and momentum the pressure and density terms in the euler equations can be combined when use is made of the perfect gas law and the isentropic relation between pressure and density ashley and landahl show how we may derive the following vector form of the unsteady full potential equation this may be simplified for the case of steady flow in 2 d to about the notation when flow is irrotational curl v 0 and by definition of curl and gradient curl grad f 0 where f is a scalar field thus we can define a nonphysical scalar potential f that describes the velocity field f is related to the velocities by the relation v grad f the equations can thus be written in terms of the unknown scalar rather than the 3 components of the velocity this simplifies their solution in the above expressions a is the local speed of sound x is the streamwise coordinate and v is the vector velocity subscripts denote partial derivatives with respect to the subscripted variables eg u x du dx mach contours yellow high dark green low from tranair analysis of a 747 200 at mach 0.84 from nas technical summaries 1994 multipoint aerodynamic design forrester t johnson boeing commercial airplane group
