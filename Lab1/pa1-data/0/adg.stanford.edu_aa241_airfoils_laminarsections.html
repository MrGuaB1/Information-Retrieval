laminar airfoil design laminar airfoil design laminar flow may be useful for reducing skin friction drag increasing maximum lift or reducing heat transfer it may be achieved without too much work at low reynolds numbers by maintaining a smooth surface and using an airfoil with a favorable pressure gradient the section below shows how the pressures may be tailored to achieve long runs of laminar flow on upper and or lower surfaces again the stratford like pressure recovery is helpful in achieving the maximum run of favorable gradient on either upper or lower surfaces
