wave pipelining next up previous next addition and floating point up algorithms and systems previous algorithms and systems wave pipelining ordinary pipeline systems operate at a frequency that corresponds to the maximum logic path delay between any two stages theoretically it is possible to increase this frequency by an amount of time equal to the minimum path delay that might occur in the worst case stage in snap research we have shown that it is possible to use cad tools to automatically increase the minimum or the fast paths to a point where the minimum path logic acts as a significant part of the storage system we have shown that clocking ecl circuits at 2 1 2 to 3 times the maximum propagation delay is feasible in a bipolar ecl experiment wong p27 showed that the path of a multiplier that had a worst case path delay of about 10 nanoseconds could be safely clocked at a 4 nanosecond rate in further research using a cmos multiplier klass p3 has designed a 6 times improvement in clock rate resulting in a 600 mhz integer multiplication see figure 1 figure 1 a wave pipelined multiplier in cmos 0.8 cycles figure shows repetition rate latency is about 9ns upper and lower parts show different data patterns michael flynn tue dec 13 10 27 47 pst 1994
