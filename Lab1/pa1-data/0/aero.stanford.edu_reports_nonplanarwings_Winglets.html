nonplanar wings winglets and tip devices examples winglets and tip devices the most common contemporary nonplanar wing configuration is the wing with winglets as seen below on the mcdonnell douglas md 11 these surfaces do reduce induced drag for a given span as well as providing a means of quickly distinguishing the airplane from a dc 10 the md 11 design includes small downward winglets while the 747 400 employs a full chord single winglet and many other variations are possible a variant of the winglet concept the c wing is discussed later in this paper it involves adding a horizontal winglet extension a wingletlet and has interesting aerodynamic structural and control implications
