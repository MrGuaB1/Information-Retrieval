center on nanostructuring for efficient energy conversion partners cneec logo intranet partners external partners cneec's partners are an important element in our research in that they complement our scientific program our relationship with them not only provides complementary expertise and resources to the proposed program but also offers opportunities to interact with industry for effective transfer of new concepts and technologies in energy sciences we interact and collaborate with researchers from our partner institutions frequently 1 the technical university of denmark this university brings world class expertise in theory to elucidate underlying phenomena and to guide the design of new materials and structures they are one of the leading groups in the world in modeling of catalytic behavior related to fuel cells and biomimetic structures which is an expertise critically important for cneec's research programs a significant portion of the quantum simulations are performed there 2 hrl laboratories this center in malibu california provides first rate scientific research and a link to industrial partners as hrl is a joint venture between general motors and boeing we are provided with a unique industrial outreach opportunity as these companies would be likely recipients and beneficiaries of the ideas scientific understanding and technologies created by the center specifically hrl's work with batteries is expected to advance the science of ionics at the nanoscale by exploring high gradients high surface area to volume ratios and reduced dimensionality 3 carnegie institution department of plant biology we rely strongly on the carnegie institute for their expertise in plant biology photosynthesis and biomimetic structures in particular we use their facilities for developing nanoscaled electrode surfaces with surface modifiers that mimic in vivo electron accepting moieties associated with charge transfer in natural photosynthetic electron transport by interfacing photosynthetic electron transport with external electron acceptor surfaces our research may provide insight in the construction of systems which can extract electrons from natural or artificial electron generating systems and use them for specific reductive or energy generating processes center on nanostructuring for efficient energy conversion is an energy frontier research center funded by the us department of energy office of science and office of basic energy sciences stanford home engineering home cneec home contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved cneec research faculty directors & pi's partners team & research slideshow facilities tutorials get involved contact us
