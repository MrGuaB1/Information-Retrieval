bio x stanford university liang liang applied physics bio x sigf fellow 2009 profs liqun luo biology and mark schnitzer biology applied physics liang is interested in the organization and information processing principles of neural circuits she uses the fruit fly olfactory system as a model to study the functional connections in the central nervous system and to characterize where and how the olfactory information is integrated and transformed she is incorporating advanced fly genetics light activated microbial opsins and genetically encoded calcium indicators to manipulate and record neuronal activity with high spatiotemporal resolution the novel noninvasive optogenetic approach will help better understand the neural coding in the olfactory circuitry and to gain insight into the organization principles of neural systems fellowships
