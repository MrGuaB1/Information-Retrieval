department of aeronautics & astronautics aeroastro logo space systems the aero astro space and systems development lab provides education and research in space system design technology and operation students gets hands on experience in developing micro satellites that are launched into orbit and controlled at stanford stanford was one of the leaders in the development of cubesats a modular satellite payload system that allows researchers at universities around the world to design experiments that can be launched into space relatively easily work continues on the application of systems engineering to the life cycle of spacecraft including design testing launching and operation of subsystems in the aero fluid mechanics laboratory researchers study turbulent reacting and variable density flows with application to propulsion systems they also investigate the decomposition of nitrous oxide for small space thrusters researchers in the aerospace robotics laboratory develop technology for robotic exploration of remote and hostile environments in space and underwater the space environment and satellite systems sess group seeks to understand the interaction of satellite systems with plasmas the environment primarily includes energetic particles meteoroids and space debris aero astro students and faculty work with the hansen experimental physics lab on experiments that can only be conducted in space for example one recent space experiment validated two higher order effects predicted by einstein's general theory of relativity 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved about aeroastro computational based design control and navigation space systems structural health monitoring sustainable aviation faculty faculty search research labs curriculum student research admissions & financial aid events affiliates membership giving to aa links contact us
