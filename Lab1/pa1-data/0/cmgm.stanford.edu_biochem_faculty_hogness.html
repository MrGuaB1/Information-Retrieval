research of david s hogness david s hogness email hogness cmgm stanford edu web no lab page we wish to understand the mechanisms by which genes control development we are studying two sorts of genetic regulatory hierarchies controlling development in drosophila melanogaster one of these specifies the segmentation pattern of the body plan along its anterior posterior axis within this hierarchy we are mostly concerned with the homeotic genes which act as general transducers of positional information to specify the segmental identities ie the characteristics that distinguish one metamere from another the second kind of hierarchy serves to coordinate temporally the developmental pathways of different tissues at various stages of development the coordination signal for these hierarchies consists of pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone within this hierarchy we are mostly concerned with the gene encoding the receptor protein for ecdysone and the early genes which are induced by the ecdysone receptor complex to yield regulatory proteins that govern the tissue specific responses to the ecdysone pulse current work is focused on the most dramatic example of these responses where the pulse of ecdysone at the end of larval life induces metamorphosis to the adult fly with imaginal tissues forming adult structures like eyes wings and legs while strictly larval tissues are induced to follow a downward path toward histolysis gavis er and hogness ds 1991 phosphorylation expression and function of the ultrabithorax protein family in drosophila melanogaster development 112 1077 93 medline lopez aj and hogness ds 1991 immunochemical dissection of the ultrabithorax homeoprotein family in drosophila melanogaster proc natl acad sci usa 88 9924 9928 medline irvine kd botas j jha s mann rs and hogness ds 1993 negative autoregulation by ultrabithorax controls the level and pattern of its expression development 117 387 99 medline robinow s talbot ws hogness ds and truman jw 1993 programmed cell death in the drosophila cns is ecdysone regulated and coupled with a specific ecdysone receptor isoform development 119 1251 1259 medline talbot ws swyryd ea and hogness ds 1993 drosophila tissues with different metamorphic responses to ecdysone express different ecdysone receptor isoforms cell 73 1323 37 medline truman jw talbot ws fahrbach se and hogness ds 1994 ecdysone receptor expression in the cns correlates with stage specific responses to ecdysteroids during drosophila and manduca development development 120 219 234 medline
