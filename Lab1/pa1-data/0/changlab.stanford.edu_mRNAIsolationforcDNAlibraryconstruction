rna isolation sxz mrna isolation protocol m rna isolation from total rna with oligotex mrna mini kit qiagen cat 70022 before starting heat oligotex suspension to 37 c in a water bath or heating block mix by vortexing and then place at room temperature heat a water bath or heating block to 70 c and heat buffer oeb bring the rna samples 250ug to 250ul with rnase free water add 250ul of buffer obb mix well add 15ul of oligotex suspension mix well incubate the samples at 70c for 3min incubate the samples at room temperature for 10 20min centrifuge at max speed for 2 min remove the supernatant by pipetting re suspend the oligotex rna pellet in 400ul buffer ow2 by pipetting apply the oligotex rna pellet to a spin colum centrifuge for 1 min at max speed transfer the column to a new 1.5 ml tub add 400ul of ow2 and mix well by pipetting centrifuge for 1 min at max speed transfer the column to a new 1.5 ml tub apply 120ul of oeb buffer 70c to the column pipette up and down 5 8 time to re suspend the resin centrifuge for 1 min at max speed apply 120ul of oeb buffer 70c again to the column pipette up and down 5 8 time to re suspend the resin centrifuge for 1 min at max speed for the two elution of total 240ul mrna to do precipita tion by adding 1ul linear acrylamine 5ug ul 60ul 2m sodium acetate ph 4.4 1000ul 100 etoh 100ul h2o total volume should be 1.5 ml mix well and keep at 80c for overnight centrifuge the precipitation solution at 4c with max speed for 30min washing the pellets with 70 etoh centrifuge at 4c with max speed for 30min remove the residual etoh dry the pellets by 10min re suspend the pellets in 10ul rnase free water the mrna is ready for cdna library construction
