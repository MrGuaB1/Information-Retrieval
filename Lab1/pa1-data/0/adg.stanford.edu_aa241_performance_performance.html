aircraft performance aircraft performance aircraft performance includes many aspects of the airplane operation here we deal with a few of the most important performance measures including airfield performance climb and cruise the following sections describe how each of these may be calculated at the early stages of design by combining fundamental calculations with statistical data from actual aircraft each of these performance measures will be used as a constraint in the airplane optimization process and are among many constraints imposed by the fars take off field length landing field length climb performance cruise performance and range
