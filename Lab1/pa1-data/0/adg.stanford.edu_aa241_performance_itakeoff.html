take off field length take off field length computation inputs the following speeds are of importance in the take off field length calculation v mu minimum unstick speed minimum airspeed at which airplane can safely lift off ground and continue take off v mc minimum control speed minimum airspeed at which when critical engine is made inoperative it is still possible to recover control of the airplane and maintain straight flight v mcg minimum control speed on the ground at this speed the aircraft must be able to continue a straight path down the runway with a failed engine without relying on nose gear reactions v 1 decision speed a short time after critical engine failure speed above this speed aerodynamic controls alone must be adequate to proceed safely with takeoff v r rotation speed must be greater than v 1 and greater than 1.05 v mc v lo lift off speed must be greater than 1.1 v mu with all engines or 1.05 v mu with engine out v 2 take off climb speed is the demonstrated airspeed at the 35 ft height must be greater than 1.1 v mc and 1.2 v s the stalling speed in the take off configuration
