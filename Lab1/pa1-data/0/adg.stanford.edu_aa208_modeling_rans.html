reynolds averaged navier stokes equations reynolds averaged navier stokes equations one of the most popular simplifications made to the navier stokes equations is reynolds averaging this simplification to the full navier stokes equations involves taking time averages of the velocity terms in the equations writing u u u v v v etc where represents a time average with the fluctuations having zero mean value u 0 we have u 2 u 2 u 2 uv u v u v this allows us to write the time averaged ns equations as and similarly for the y and z components this looks just like the more general navier stokes equations for incompressible flow which hold for steady laminar flow except that there are additional terms that act as additional stresses on the right hand side these terms represent the effect of turbulence on the mean flow they are called reynolds stresses and are sometimes said to be caused by eddy viscosity these terms are generally much larger than the normal viscous terms the business of predicting these stresses and relating them to the computed mean flow properties is called turbulence modeling this is usually accomplished empirically or by using the results of detailed time dependent simulations reynolds averaged ns solvers are appropriate for the analysis of viscous compressible flows and have been applied to rather general configurations but one must be careful that the assumptions of the turbulence model are compatible with the characteristics of the flow of interest from nas technical summaries high lift configuration cfd karlin roth nasa ames research center this may not be so clear but after some manipulation of the equations it does work out see schlichting pgs 557 562 note that for steady laminar flow we do not have these extra terms they are caused by small scale unsteadiness associated with turbulence
