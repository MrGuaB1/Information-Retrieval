mcm technology next up previous next advanced packaging up subnanosecond arithmetic for 1990 1993 previous division and higher mcm technology considerable progress has been made in the area of high performance packaging in particular a technology for attaching and connecting chips onto a silicon membrane multichip module mcm has been demonstrated p2 this technology utilizes conventional ic processing techniques and offers a high density over 500 per chip of small as small as low resistance less than 0.024 contact and low parasitic interconnections between a chip and the substrate see figure 3 in addition controlled impedance striplines have been fabricated on the mcm substrate figure 3 a membrane multi chip module in si b process steps for making membrane mcm substrate c time domain reflectometry the initial experimental striplines have been implemented in a three layer ground signal ground configuration with aluminum conductors and polyimide dielectric the sandwiched structure ensures a constant characteristic impedance as the stripline crosses the boundary between the mcm substrate and the chip the stripline has been characterized with time domain reflectometry the delay is 68 psec cm which corresponds to a propagation velocity of cm sec a pulse rise time of 72 psec which corresponds to a db bandwidth of 3 ghz has been measured on a 1 cm long line these results are consistent with those predicted by simulations michael flynn tue dec 13 10 27 47 pst 1994
