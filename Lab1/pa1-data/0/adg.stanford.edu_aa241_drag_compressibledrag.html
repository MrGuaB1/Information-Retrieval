compressibility drag transonic compressibility drag this section deals with the effect of mach number on drag from subsonic speeds through transonic speeds we concentrate on some of the basic physics of compressible flow in order to estimate the incremental drag associated with mach number the chapter is divided into the following sections introduction predicting m div and m cc 3 d effects and sweep predicting c dc notation for this chapter c l airplane lift coefficient dc d c incremental drag coefficient due to compressibility m cc crest critical mach number the flight mach number at which the velocities at the crest of the wing in a direction normal to the isobars becomes sonic m 0 the flight mach number b prandtl glauert factor 1 m 0 1 2 t c average thickness to chord ratio in the freestream direction for the exposed part of the wing v 0 the flight speed dv surface perturbation velocity l c 4 wing quarter chord sweepback angle degrees l c sweepback angle of isobars at wing crest degrees g ratio of specific heats 1.40 for air
