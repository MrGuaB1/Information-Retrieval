camp annual meeting page members login home faculty research affilliates kaust contact links what is camp camp the center for advanced molecular photovoltaics at stanford university is a research center led by profs michael mcgehee alan sellinger and reiner dauskardt with the goal of revolutionizing the global energy landscape by developing the science and technology for stable efficient molecular photovoltaic cells that can compete with fossil fuels in cost per kilowatt hour produced while today's best molecular solar cells have efficiencies up to 8.5 and last approximately 2 years in sunlight our vision is to increase the efficiency to at least 15 and make the cells stable for 10 years or more furthermore developing manufacturing technologies and production of cells at very low cost is also a high priority to achieve these goals camp has a renowned team of 15 principal investigators pis from stanford uc berkeley usc georgia tech and epfl see second page for a brief team description the center director is prof michael mcgehee stanford the management team further consists of executive director consulting prof alan sellinger stanford deputy director prof reiner dauskardt stanford prof mark thompson usc prof michael gratzel epfl and prof jean luc bredas georgia tech an estimated 60 or more students and post doctoral researchers are engaged in the research activities at camp camp is funded starting in june2008 by a 5 year $25 m grant from the king abdullah university of science and technology kaust global research partnership program camp's activities span polymer small molecular and dye sensitized molecular solar cells with research activities in molecular design through advanced quantum mechanical calculations molecular synthesis nanostructure engineering and characterization understanding and engineering carrier recombination light management transparent contacts and the engineering of durable molecular solar cells camp's activities will span polymer small molecular and dye sensitized molecular solar cells with research activities in molecular design through advanced quantum mechanical calculations molecular synthesis nanostructure engineering and characterization understanding and engineering carrier recombination light management transparent contacts third generation cell concepts and the engineering of durable molecular solar cells news march 2012 professor michael gratzel receives the 2012 albert einstein world award of science more february 2012 stanford engineers weld nanowires with light more april 2011 2011 mrs spring meeting graduate student award gold medal winners jonathan rivnay salleo group and ed barnard brongersma group more march 20 2011 kaust named lab of the year by r&d magazine more february 28 2011 prof zhenan bao receives the arthur c cope scholar award more more news & events events 2012 mrs spring meeting & exhibit april 9 13 2012 san francisco ca more polymers in photovoltaics 2012 april 24 26 2012 cologne germany more 4th hybrid and organic photovoltaics conference may 6 9 2012 uppsala sweden more more news & events kaust faculty research projects industrial affiliates kaust contact us links privacy terms of use copyright 2009 stanford university site by sf o design
