fukuma abstract spring 2003 seminar public lecture series topics in international advanced technology research photonic interconnects on chip and chip to system photonics future optoelectronic devices for communications and interconnections a perspective by masao fukuma vice president of laboratories nec corporation this presentation gives an overview of optoelectronic devices for future communications and interconnections although today's optical communication business is in crisis the requirement for future broadband communications is strong one topic in long communications is the world's broadest ultra dense wdm transmission with 10.9 tbps the key devices used in this system such as dfb laser diodes optical amplifier and detectors will be shown for metro access communications low cost and high performance devices such as direct modulation laser diodes and high sensitivity detectors that can be applicable to 10g ethernet are essential this talk will also cover optical interconnections for board board chip chip and intra chip page last modified april 25 2003 stanford university us asia technology management center copyright 1995 2002
