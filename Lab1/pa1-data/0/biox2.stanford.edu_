bio x2 home bio x2 cluster home news profile documentation contact logout introducing bio x2 featuring 20 teraflops of 8 core nodes with 4xddr infiniband interconnect what is bio x2 the bio x2 cluster is the result of an nsf funded research proposal submitted by 21 bio x affiliated faculty representing 13 departments and 4 schools at stanford the purpose of the cluster is to facilitate biological research problems ranging in scale from molecules to organisms bio x2 was funded by the national science foundation the hardware represents generous donations by both dell and cisco the new cluster is housed in james h clark center hub for the bio x program the bio x2 cluster has been ranked 54 in the june 2007 release of the top500 supercomputers list what's new the latest cluster events can be found on the news page rss feed the next generation supercomputing cluster has been installed in late january early february 2007 while the spirit and scope of the original cluster live on the new cluster utilizes cutting edge technologies and ultra fast interconnects what's old the original bio x cluster was retired on january 16 2007 it has been de comissioned and removed from clark center for reuse and recycling photos of the un racking of the old cluster can be found here why use this supercomputer bio x2 is one of the existing most powerful supercomputers with 20.6 teraflops it's been ranked 54 in the june 2007 top500 list it contains 2208 cores within 276 dell poweredge 1950 compute nodes dual socket quad core processors featuring 16gb of memory each the system storage includes a 50tb parallel lustre file system and a 4xddr infiniband switch fabric employing pcie interfaces interconnects the nodes i o and inter process communication with a 20gb s per link non blocking tree topology see the hardware section of the documentation for more details creating shared computing resources allows many groups to combine their hardware efforts into a central resource the resulting system is larger than any individual lab could fund and manage on their own systems administration is greatly reduced allowing you to focus on your research how can i get an account if you re member of a registered lab you can use the user application form if you re a pi and want to register your lab please use the lab application form if you already have an account you can access your profile page more information please see our documentation for more details note that accounts are restricted to projects involving biological applications broadly defined please contact prof vijay pande pande at stanford dot edu or prof michael levitt michael dot levitt at stanford dot edu if you have any questions or comments regarding scientific matters or biox2 administrators at lists dot stanford dot edu for administrative technical or documentation questions copyright 2007 2008 kilian cavalotti bio x su all rights reserved
