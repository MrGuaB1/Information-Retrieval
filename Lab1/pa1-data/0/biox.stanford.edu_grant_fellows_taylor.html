bio x stanford university rebecca taylor mechanical engineering bio x graduate student fellowships 2007 2008 profs ellen kuhl mechanical engineering and beth pruitt mechanical engineering after a heart attack the heart has limited ability to repair itself because cardiomyocytes cms are difficult to culture in vitro there are few options for creating tissue patches to repair the heart dynamic cell culture which provides synchronized electric field pacing and cyclic strain holds promise for enabling the creation of stem cell derived cm grafts with regenerative capacity for healing an infracted heart our computational models and newly developed tools utilizing stretchable microelectrode arrays and micropatterned silicone substrates will enable engineers and biologists to create enhanced cell culture platforms for both basic and translational research into cm growth fellowships
