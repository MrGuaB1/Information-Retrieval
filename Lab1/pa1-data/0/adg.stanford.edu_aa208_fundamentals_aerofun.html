untitled 4 aerodynamic fundamentals this chapter deals with some basic concepts in aerodynamic analysis that are of particular interest in constructing models for simulation and control despite the widespread use of nonlinear cfd methods for aerodynamic analysis we will rely strongly on linear aerodynamics analysis here for several reasons although several aerodynamic features may require high fidelity computations eg shock boundary layer interaction linear analysis codes are surprisingly good at predicting the integrated flow quantities such as the forces and moments as described earlier we are forced to simplify the aerodynamic model often linearly anyway thus information from a very detailed nonlinear model may be ignored even if it were available although the field equations for fluid flow may be linearized the boundary conditions and force equations are not thus one may obtain fundamentally nonlinear effects such as the angle of attack dependence of clb even from a linear code most of the important physical phenomena are reflected in the simplified analysis allowing us to develop some insight and a qualitative view of the important physical effects finally the methods are fast and do not require great expertise in the development of a computational model so we can analyze a dozen designs in the course of a quarter this chapter will deal with some of these classical aerodynamic models and their application to the following cases airfoils and wings bodies of revolution interactions and wakes controls unsteady effects summary of derivative estimation
