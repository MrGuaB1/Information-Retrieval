low reynolds number airfoil design low reynolds number airfoil design low reynolds numbers make the problem of airfoil design difficult because the boundary layer is much less capable of handling an adverse pressure gradient without separation thus very low reynolds number designs do not have severe pressure gradients and the maximum lift capability is restricted low reynolds number airfoil designs are cursed with the problem of too much laminar flow it is sometimes difficult to assure that the boundary layer is turbulent over the steepest pressure recovery regions laminar separation bubbles are common and unless properly stabilized can lead to excessive drag and low maximum lift at very low reynolds numbers most or all of the boundary layer is laminar under such conditions the boundary layer can handle only gradual pressure recovery based on the expressions for laminar separation one finds that an all laminar section can generate a c l of about 0.4 or achieve a thickness of about 7.5 try this with panda
