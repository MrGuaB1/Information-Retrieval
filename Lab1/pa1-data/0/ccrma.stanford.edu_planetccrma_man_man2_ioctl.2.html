ioctl ioctl 2 name ioctl control device synopsis include sys ioctl h int ioctl int d int request description the ioctl function manipulates the underlying device parameters of spe cial files in particular many operating characteristics of character special files eg terminals may be controlled with ioctl requests the argument d must be an open file descriptor the second argument is a device dependent request code the third argument is an untyped pointer to memory it's traditionally char argp from the days before void was valid c and will be so named for this discussion an ioctl request has encoded in it whether the argument is an in param eter or out parameter and the size of the argument argp in bytes macros and defines used in specifying an ioctl request are located in the file sys ioctl h return value usually on success zero is returned a few ioctls use the return value as an output parameter and return a nonnegative value on success on error 1 is returned and errno is set appropriately errors ebadf d is not a valid descriptor efault argp references an inaccessible memory area enotty d is not associated with a character special device enotty the specified request does not apply to the kind of object that the descriptor d references einval request or argp is not valid conforming to no single standard arguments returns and semantics of ioctl 2 vary according to the device driver in question the call is used as a catch all for operations that don t cleanly fit the unix stream i o model see ioctl_list 2 for a list of many of the known ioctl calls the ioctl function call appeared in version 7 at&t unix see also execve 2 fcntl 2 ioctl_list 2 mt 4 sd 4 tty 4 bsd man page 2000 09 21 ioctl 2
