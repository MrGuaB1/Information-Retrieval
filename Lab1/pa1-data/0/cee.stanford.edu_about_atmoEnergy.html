stanford engineering intranet atmosphere energy the link between atmosphere and energy the atmosphere energy subprogram in civil and environmental engineering formed in 2004 combines atmospheric science with energy science and engineering the main goals of the program are to educate students and the public through courses research and public outreach about the causes of climate air pollution and weather problems and methods of addressing these problems through renewable and efficient energy systems in addition students learn about feedbacks between the atmosphere and renewable energy systems and the effects of the current energy infrastructure on the atmosphere further employment and research graduates of the program go on to work for nongovernmental organizations ngos companies government agencies public or private institutes national research laboratories or educational institutes research in the program is performed primarily at the phd level although ms and undergraduate students can become involved in research through either a directed research course for credit a student group eg the solar and wind energy project or by working with a company on a research topic below are some example topics of research performed in the program at the phd level atmospheric research atmospheric research in the program generally involves either laboratory work field measurements or three dimensional computer modeling of the combined atmosphere ocean and land surface an example of laboratory work includes measuring the properties of organic particulate matter that forms in the atmosphere examples of field work include measuring exposures to secondhand smoke allergens and emissions from building materials computer modeling is performed at a variety of spatial scales from the globe down to the size of a building or smaller some examples of modeling studies include examining the effects of air pollution particles on clouds rainfall water supply ultraviolet radiation the stratospheric ozone layer and climate simulating the dispersion of toxic contaminants in an urban street canyon studying the effects of aircraft exhaust and biomass burning on climate studying the effects of carbon dioxide domes over cities on air pollution mortality and studying the leading causes of global warming and their impacts energy research major focus areas of energy research include examining the resource availability of renewable energies such as wind solar and wave and studying optimal methods of combining renewable energies together to match energy supply with instantaneous demand this type of work is generally done through a combination of data analysis three dimensional atmospheric computer modeling of wind solar wave and hydroelectric power resources and transmission load flow computer modeling the research has led to the world's first wind map from data based on the height of modern wind turbines other energy research performed through three dimensional computer modeling focuses on the effects for example of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on air pollution and the ozone layer and the effects of ethanol and diesel vehicles on air quality and climate studies also examine the feedback of wind turbines to the atmosphere and the effects of climate change on wind and solar energy resources atmosphere energy home faculty working in this area director please choose jacobson mark dir hamby joell pa cee faculty please choose hildemann lynn jacobson mark masters gilbert street robert consulting faculty please choose golden dave knapp karl ludwig frank swisher joel woodward jane cee and stanford faculty affiliates please choose criddle craig diffenbaugh noah durlofsky lou edwards chris field chris fischer michel freyberg david gerritsen margot g heller thomas horne roland kennedy donald kovscek anthony luthy richard lepech michael levitt raymond mcgehee michael orr franklin ortolano leonard spormann alfred sweeney james switzer paul wara michael weyant john stanford research affiliates please choose caldeira ken map ming visiting professors please choose lovins amory komor paul gadgil ashok koomey jon swisher joel shimizu visiting professors please choose jenkins nick koomey jon tabazadeh azadeh stanford home engineering home cee home site map contact us 1997 2012 stanford university all rights reserved prospective students current students alumni about cee atmosphere energy built environment water environment programs faculty & staff research admissions events calendar visit us
