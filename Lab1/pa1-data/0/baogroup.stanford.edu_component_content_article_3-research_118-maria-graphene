dip pen nanolithography contacts for single graphene bao research group stanford university home people current alumni new member research research topics archived news wikilab lab members only publications press contact us visitors abstract this study evaluates an alternative to electron beam lithography for fabricating nanoscale graphene devices dip pen nanolithography is used for defining monolayer graphene flakes and for patterning of gold electrodes through writing of an alkylthiol on thin films of gold evaporated onto graphene flakes a wet gold etching step was used to form the individual devices the sheet resistances of these monolayer graphene devices are comparable to reported literature values this alternative technique for making electrical contact to 2d nanostructures provides a platform for fundamental studies of nanomaterial properties the merits of using dip pen nanolithography include lack of electron beam irradiation damage and targeted patterning of individual devices with imaging and writing conducted in the same instrument under ambient conditions full paper at http pubs acs org doi full 10.1021 nn101324x copyright 2009 2011 all rights reserved credits bao group benjamin tee soumen barmen logo by benjamin tee
