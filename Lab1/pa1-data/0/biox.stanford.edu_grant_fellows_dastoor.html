bio x stanford university sanjay dastoor mechanical engineering bio x graduate student fellowships 2006 2007 profs mark cutkosky mechanical engineering and scott delp bioengineering mechanical engineering sanjay is researching the application of artificial muscles to robotics and prosthetics through a novel manufacturing method electric motors lack many of the dynamic characteristics of biological muscle limiting their use in biomimetic devices electroactive polymer actuators are a promising alternative with muscle like performance light weight low cost and silent operation he is developing methods for fabricating these actuators using shape deposition manufacturing which allows customized geometries heterogeneous materials and embedded components fellowships
