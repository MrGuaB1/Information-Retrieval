bio x stanford university pakpoom subsoontorn bio x bioengineering graduate fellow 2008 professor drew endy bioengineering ton is developing a design framework for genetically encoded memory the memory system is built from in vivo machineries and functions inside a living cell particularly he is exploring two alternative approaches multistabilities of gene expression and site specific dna modifications the challenges are to have fast mechanisms for encoding and decoding information and to have stable storages under stochastic environment inside a cell this technology will be critical for engineering increasingly more complicated behaviors of a living cell just as electronic memory systems are crucial for the modern computer fellowships
