bio x stanford university sheng ding bio x bioengineering graduate fellow 2007 1 year award professor annelise barron bioengineering tissue engineering is an exciting and revolutionary strategy to overcome the problem of donor shortage in tissue transplantation the barron lab investigates appropriate scaffolds mimicking the natural extracellular matrices which deliver the cells to the desired site provide a space for new tissue formation and potentially control the structure and function of the new tissue sheng's research project is to create protein polymer hydrogels that are enzymatically crosslinked as tissue engineering scaffolds these new hydrogels are biocompatible and biodegradable using genetic engineering the barron lab can modify these hydrogels for particular requirements for specific tissue engineering applications by carefully designing the amino acid sequence chain length and block spacing of the protein polymers fellowships
