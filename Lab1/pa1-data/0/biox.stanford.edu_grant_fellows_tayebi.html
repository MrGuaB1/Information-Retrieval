bio x stanford university noureddine tayebi electrical engineering bio x graduate student fellowships 2009 2010 profs nicholas melosh materials science & engineering and ricardo dolmestch neurobiology autism spectrum disorders asds cause language and social impairments in children gene mutations can cause asds by altering signaling pathways of ca2+ ions in neurons implicated with asds to detect such alterations the patch clamp technique which allows for high resolution current measurements in ion channels is used however low throughput and the destructive nature of the technique prevent observing communications between neurons and long experiment longevity to mitigate these problems noureddine is helping to develop novel chip based patch clamp arrays where nanoposts are nondestructively fused into neuron membranes this allows the study of long term genetic mutation effects and communication abnormalities between neurons fellowships
