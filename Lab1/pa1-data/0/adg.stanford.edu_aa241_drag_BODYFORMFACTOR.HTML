form factor for bodies form factor for bodies the fineness ratio of the fuselage affects the fuselage drag by increasing the local velocities and creating a pressure drag the increase in skin friction due to higher than freestream velocities can be estimated by considering the symmetric flow around a body of revolution for bodies of revolution the increase in surface velocity due to thickness is smaller than for 2 d shapes from potential flow theory the maximum velocity over an ellipse with thickness ratio t c is du max u 0 t c the maximum velocity increase on an ellipsoid of revolution is given by the potential flow solution du max u 0 a 2 a 1 m 2 0.5 where a 2 1 m 2 d 2 d 3 tanh 1 d d and d 1 1 m 2 d 2 0.5 and d diameter length the actual surface velocity distribution depends strongly on the shape of the body paraboloids have about half again as much maximum perturbation velocities as ellipsoids and fuselages with constant cross sections are quite different but the idea here is to represent the correct trend theoretically and then obtain empirical constants if a sort of average perturbation velocity is represented by c du max then the form factor k for bodies may be written k 1 c du max u 0 2 the figure below shows that a factor c 2.3 leads to reasonable agreement with the purely empirical method given by shevell at supersonic speeds the optimum body shape is closer to a paraboliod but the velocity distribution is quite different the maximum velocity no longer occurs at the middle of the body and the flow is decelerated over more of the area in fact based on linear theory the net form factor is 1.0 form factor calculation this calculator may be used to compute the form factor for a body of revolution fineness ratio mach k
