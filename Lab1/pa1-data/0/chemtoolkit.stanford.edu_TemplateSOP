creating standard operating procedures laboratory chemical safety toolkit home creating standard operating procedures summary standard operating procedure a standard operating procedure sop is a set of written instructions that describes in detail how to perform a laboratory process or experiment safely and effectively sops are a requirement of stanford university's chemical hygiene plan http chemhygieneplan stanford edu as described in section 4.0 the scope of an sop can cover the specific use of a chemical or class of chemicals such as a specific laboratory procedure the generic use specific chemical or class of chemicals with similar hazards for example mineral acids a generic procedure such as distillation that covers several chemicals responsibility the pi lab supervisor is responsible for providing written standard operating procedures sops relevant to health and safety for laboratory activities he she directs involving hazardous chemicals laboratory personnel working autonomously or performing independent research are responsible for developing sops appropriate for their own work using the guidance below prioritizing sop development priority for sop development should be given to any operation involving restricted chemicals certain higher risk chemicals such as particularly hazardous chemicals and highly reactive chemicals and specified higher risk research procedures described in the chp what to do how to do this 1 prioritize sops to generate consult with pi laboratory supervisor on above guidance 2 create sops use su's sop template or equivalent if using su sop template complete sections 1 10 the grey text provides guidance on how to complete the section guidance text may be deleted some sections indicate blanks to complete section 7 emergency procedures provides the established stanford university procedures to follow with specific contact information to be added after completion review the sop with your principal investigator lab supervisor note at any time you are welcome to consult with eh&s 723 0448 during the development of your sop general use sops general use sops for the major classes of hazardous chemicals are available for you to incorporate into your own sops as appropriate carcinogens compressed gases corrosive materials cyrogenic liquids flammable & combustible liquids highly acutely toxic materials highly reactive unstable materials irritants reproductive toxins sensitizers restricted chemicals nanomaterials 3 maintain sops maintain copy that is physically or electronically accessible to all lab members 4 revise sops consult with pi laboratory supervisor on sop on timeframe for re evaluating and revising sop to ensure it reflects current best practices back to top search content content introduction getting started your responsibilities pi laboratory supervisor laboratory personnel safety training prior approval and special precautions medical surveillance safe lab practices creating standard operating procedures lab safety basics fume hood use personal protective equipment chemical storage labeling & inventory restricted chemicals & high risk procedures laboratory inspections chemical waste disposal emergencies spills or exposures emergencies spills or exposures health threatening non health threatening small spills local clean up incident reporting reference info chemical hazard classes carcinogens compressed gases corrosive materials cryogenic liquids flammable and combustible liquids highly acutely toxic chemicals highly reactive unstable materials irritants reproductive toxins sensitizers restricted chemicals laboratory chemical safety sheets material safety data sheets stanford lab safety sheets toxnet 2007 stanford university all rights reserved
