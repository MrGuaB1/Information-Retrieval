dnase treatment shirley zhu dna isolation from frozen tissue dna isolation from frozen tissue by using qiagen blood & cell culture dna maxi kit cat no 13362 and protocol with some modifications sample fresh tumor tissue about 300mg put about 300 mg tumor tissue in 19 ml of g2 buffer from the kit with 38ul of rnase a 100mg ml by using a 50ml oak ridge centrifuge tube homogenize with a powergen 125 tissue homogenizer fisher scientific starting at 5000 rpm and gradually going up to approximately 20000 rpm over a period of 30 60 seconds at rt add 1.2 ml of proteinase k 20mg ml qaigen cat no 19133 mix well incubate at 55c with shaking for overnight equilibrate a qiagen genomic tip 500 g with 10 ml of buffer qbt and allow the qiagen genomic tip to empty by gravity flow vortex the sample for 10 seconds at max speed and apply it to the equilibrated qiagen genomic tip allow the sample to enter the resin by gravity flow wash the qiagen genomic tip with 2 x 15 ml of buffer qc elute the genomic dna with 1 x 15 ml of buffer qf precipitate the dna by adding 10.5 ml 0.7 volumes room temperature isopropanol to the eluted dna mix well and centrifuge immediately at 5000 xg for 30 min at 4 c carefully remove the supernatant wash the centrifuged dna pellet with 4 ml of cold 70 ethanol vortex briefly and centrifuge at 5000 xg for 20 min at 4 c carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet air dry for 5 10 min resuspend the dna in 100 200ul of te buffer ph 8.0 dissolve the dna overnight on a shaker at room temperature or at 55 c for 1 2 hours check dna on 1 agarose gel and measure od a260 a280 1
