cef 1997 a discrete differential equation model of the us 1972 84 agenda sessions program a discrete differential equation model of the us 1972 84 walter waymeyer a dynamic 18th order model representing the behavior of the us economy from 1972 thru 1985 that closely follows from initial conditions the data used in its construction has been created the model uses a differential equation de simulation algorithm advancing the states on a weekly basis the input data are 17 us quarterly time series from john taylor's book macroeconomic policy in a world economy norton 1993 the approach to building the model may be unique the time series data are normalized to fractional gnp trend fractional price trend and fractional interest rate trend the fractional series are filled in to create weekly series having piecewise constant third derivatives the weekly series are separated in a smoothing not filtering process by frequency content into trend and perturbation about trend six principal components of the 17 component perturbation series are determined to represent essentially the entire information content of the 17 series a dynamic system matrix a as in xdot ax is extracted from the 6 principal component series and their first second and third derivatives the paper expands on the dynamic systems methodology presents examples of intermediate results gives some examples of the frequency spectra of selected variables and shows some samples of the degree of time series match starting from several initial conditions the ongoing research has the overall objective of finding control laws policies that alleviate or prevent dislocating events or processes such as the oil shocks and the business cycle s to this end an intermediate objective is the creation of a de model that updates continually with the latest measurements at any sampling interval both as to variables and parameters scheduled for session 5.3 techniques in economic dynamics agenda sessions program
