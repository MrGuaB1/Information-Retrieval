controlled dna tethering and stretching for organic molecular electronics bao research group stanford university home people current alumni new member research research topics archived news wikilab lab members only publications press contact us visitors abstract dna has been recently explored as a powerful tool for developing molecular scaffolds for making reproducible and reliable metal contacts to single organic semiconducting molecules a critical step in the process of exploiting dna organic molecule dna dod array structures is the controlled tethering and stretching of dna molecules here we report the development of reproducible surface chemistry for tethering dna molecules at tunable density and demonstrate shear flow processing as a rationally controlled approach for stretching aligning dna molecules of various lengths through enzymatic cleavage of  phage dna to yield a series of dna chains of various lengths from 17.3 m down to 4.2 m we have investigated the flow extension behavior of these tethered dna molecules under different flow strengths in the flow gradient plane we compared brownian dynamic simulations for the flow dynamics of tethered  dna in shear and found our flow gradient plane experimental results matched well with our bead spring simulations the shear flow processing demonstrated in our studies represents a controllable approach for tethering and stretching dna molecules of various lengths together with further metallization of dna chains within dod structures this bottom up approach can potentially enable efficient and reliable fabrication of large scale nanoelectronic devices based on single organic molecules therefore opening opportunities in both fundamental understanding of charge transport at the single molecular level and many exciting applications for ever shrinking molecular circuits full paper at http pubs acs org doi abs 10.1021 nn102669b copyright 2009 2011 all rights reserved credits bao group benjamin tee soumen barmen logo by benjamin tee
