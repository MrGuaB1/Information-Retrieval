effect of sweep on supersonic section drag effect of sweep on supersonic section drag consider an infinite swept wing operating at a freestream mach number of m as shown here the normal mach number is m m cos l the effective section lift coefficient is c l c l cos 2 l and the normal thickness ratio is t c t c cos l based on 2 d linear supersonic theory the section drag is given by c d 16 3 t c 2 m 2 1 1 2 c l 2 m 2 1 1 2 4 the streamwise drag is then c d c d cos 3 l if we specify a value of c d of about 0020 and an overall c l of 0.0 we can compute the allowable t c as a function of sweep this is shown in the plot below for a mach number of 1.8 the plot shows the streamwise and normal t c allowed based on this 2d and simple sweep theory note that in this case the streamwise t c drops monotonically and the normal t c has a maximum but the variation is not as large as we might expect over the large range of sweeps this allows us to estimate that over the parts of the wing with this sweep often outer wing panels we might tolerate airfoils with t c's of 2.5 to 2.8 measured in the perpendicular direction the result is sensitive to the values we pick for c l and allowable c d based on typical overall supersonic aircraft drag which might be in the range of 012 120 counts we have at this point just chosen 20 counts for wing volume wave drag rather arbitrarily we do know however that 10 counts is probably unrealistic and 40 would have a dramatic effect on overall drag if we do the calculation at a higher c l we should allow a higher overall drag level the following plot shows another sample case for initial design purposes a reasonable choice might be to look at an allowable drag increment of 0020 at a c l of 0.0 because the wing lift dependent drag is affected by the overall wing planform but it is interesting to look at other c l s as well
