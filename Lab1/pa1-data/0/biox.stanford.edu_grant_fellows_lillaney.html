bio x stanford university prasheel lillaney bio x bioengineering graduate fellow 2005 professor rebecca fahrig radiology the goal of prasheel's project is to build a hybrid x ray mri system that will allow interventional radiologists more versatility in how they approach various procedures that require mr or x ray guidance while still maintaining the image quality and performance offered by a conventional mri or x ray system prasheel is currently modeling the electron beam optics in x ray tubes and determining how the electron beam is affected by the presence of the strong mr fringe field he is also developing different x ray tube motor designs that would allow for better tube performance in the hybrid system fellowships
