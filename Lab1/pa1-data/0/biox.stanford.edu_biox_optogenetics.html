bio x stanford university optogenetics org lab course offerings optogenetics is an emerging field combining optics and genetics to probe neural circuits within intact mammals and other animals at the high speeds millisecond timescale needed to understand brain information processing optogenetics includes 1 the development of genetic targeting strategies such as cell specific promoters to deliver the light sensitive probes to selected populations of neurons in the brain of living animals eg worms fruit flies mice and 2 hardware eg integrated fiberoptic and solid state optical tools to allow specific cell types even deep within the brain to be controlled in freely behaving animals including mammals this new field of optogenetics now has allowed temporally precise understanding of how specific brain cell types important in neuropsychiatric disease function within intact neural circuits in vivo optogenetic innovation lab web site optogenetics
