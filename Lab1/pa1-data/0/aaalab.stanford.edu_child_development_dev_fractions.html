aaa lab at stanford child development and learning fractions and manipulatives cognitive development in school context fractions and manipulatives students come to the learning of the ratio concept with well developed ideas about whole numbers these ideas can interfere with understanding fractions students often interpret fraction symbols like 1 3 as two separate whole numbers 1 and 3 for students to overcome these interpretations they need opportunities to reinterpret fractions working with physical materials like manipulatives can help in this regard when they work with hands on materials students take some fairly automatic actions like separating pieces collecting pieces into sets and partitioning those sets these automatic actions turn into the mathematical actions of counting grouping and collecting during these actions children develop new interpretations of the physical array they have changed we have found that the process of active reinterpretation benefits learning both in terms of immediate changes in performance and in terms of applications and learning in new settings in particular children develop three fold interpretations in which a piece can be a unit a member of a group and a member of a whole this multiple interpretation appears to be critical to the development of the ratio concept at least in the context of parts and wholes to help children develop multiple interpretations and notice the important features of ratios we have created a new manipulative called an annaboard shown in the figure the board juxtaposes different quantities that help children notice different relations among the quantities eg twice as big the children invent notational systems to characterize the differences between the quantities the tandem processes of perceptual noticing and symbolic invention prepares students to understand the significance of a conventional notation when it becomes available
