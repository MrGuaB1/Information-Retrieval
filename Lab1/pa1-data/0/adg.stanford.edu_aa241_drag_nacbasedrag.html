nacelle base drag nacelle base drag among the many items that are included in an explicit manner one usually estimates the drag increment associated with a small gap between the engine nozzle and the nacelle nacelle base drag is a small item but is representative of the types of drag components that one tries to model in a realistic manner most turbofan engines maintain a gap between the engine nozzle and nacelle of about 1 2 inch flow separates and creates a base drag area that may be estimated as the base area 5 inch times the circumference at the nozzle exit multiplied by a drag coefficient of about 0.2 so c d nacelle_base 0.5 12 p d exit 0.2 s ref with the nozzle exit diameter measured in feet
