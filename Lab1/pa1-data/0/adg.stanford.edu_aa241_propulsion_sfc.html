untitled specific fuel consumption and overall efficiency the engine performance may be described in several ways one of the useful parameters is specific fuel consumption or sfc for turbojets and fans the sfc is usually expressed as the thrust specific fuel consumption or tsfc it is defined as the weight of the fuel burned per unit time per unit thrust in english units tsfc is usually quoted in lbs of fuel per hour per lb of thrust or just lb hr lb or 1 hr in si units the tsfc is sometime expressed in kg hr kn for turboprop or piston engines the sfc is often expressed as a power specific fuel consumption ie weight of fuel per unit time per unit power delivered to the propeller this quantity is often denoted bsfc for brake power sfc and has units of 1 length it is expressed in the unwieldy but familiar english units of lb hr hp the overall efficiency of the propulsion system is given by h power available to aircraft rate of energy consumption tv wh where t thrust v aircraft speed w rate of fuel consumption weight unit time and h specific energy of the fuel energy unit weight in terms of the sfc h v tsfc h one must be careful to use consistent units in this expression overall efficiency of several engines vs mach number overall efficiency vs bypass ratio for large commercial turbine engines from dennis berry boeing trends in advanced engine efficiency subsonic engine efficiencies at about min sfc throttle setting 80 at typical cruise conditions ge90 361 pw4000 348 pw2037 351 m 87 40k pw2037 335 m 80 35k cfm56 2 305 tfe731 2 234
