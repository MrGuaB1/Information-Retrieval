parasite drag parasite drag the parasite drag of a typical airplane in the cruise configuration consists primarily of the skin friction roughness and pressure drag of the major components there is usually some additional parasite drag due to such things as fuselage upsweep control surface gaps base areas and other extraneous items since most of the elements that make up the total parasite drag are dependent on reynolds number and since some are dependent on mach number it is necessary to specify the conditions under which the parasite drag is to be evaluated in the method of these notes the conditions selected are the mach number and the reynolds number corresponding to the flight condition of interest the basic parasite drag area for airfoil and body shapes can be computed from the following expression f kc f s wet where the skin friction coefficient c f which is based on the exposed wetted area includes the effects of roughness and the form factor k accounts for the effects of both supervelocities and pressure drag s wet is the total wetted area of the body or surface computation of the overall parasite drag requires that we compute the drag area of each of the major components fuselage wing nacelles and pylons and tail surfaces and then evaluate the additional parasite drag components described above we thus write c d p s k i c f i s wet i s ref c dupsweep c dgap c dnac_base c dmisc where the first term includes skin friction and pressure drag at zero lift of the major components c f i is the average skin friction coefficient for a rough plate with transition at flight reynolds number equivalent roughness is determined from flight test data these computations are divided into evaluation of the following terms skin friction coefficient c f form factor k wetted area s wet control surface gap drag aft fuselage upsweep drag nacelle base drag miscellaneous items
