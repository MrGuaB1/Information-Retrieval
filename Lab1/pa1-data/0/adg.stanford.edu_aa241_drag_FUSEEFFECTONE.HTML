fuselage effect on induced drag fuselage effect on induced drag one may estimate the drag associated with fuselage interference in the following manner if the flow were axially symmetric and the fuselage were long then mass conservation leads to b 2 b 2 d 2 for minimum drag with fixed lift the downwash in the far wake should be constant so the wake vorticity is just like that associated with an elliptical wing with no fuselage of span b the lift on the wing fuselage system is computable from the far field vorticity so the span efficiency is e 1 d 2 b 2 in practice one does not achieve this much lift on the fuselage assuming a long circular fuselage and computing the lift based on images the resulting induced drag increment is about twice the simple theoretical value so s 1 2 d 2 b 2
