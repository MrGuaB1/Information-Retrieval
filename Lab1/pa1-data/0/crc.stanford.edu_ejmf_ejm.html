blank prof edward j mccluskey worked on electronic switching systems at the bell telephone laboratories from 1955 to 1959 in 1959 he moved to princeton university where he was professor of electrical engineering and director of the university computer center in 1966 he joined stanford university where he is professor of electrical engineering and computer science as well as director of the center for reliable computing crc he founded the stanford digital systems laboratory now the computer systems laboratory in 1969 and the stanford computer engineering program now the computer science ms degree program in 1970 the stanford computer forum an industrial affiliates program was started by prof mccluskey and two colleagues prof bill miller and in 1970 and he was its director until 1978 prof mccluskey developed the first algorithm for designing combinational circuits the quine mccluskey logic minimization procedure as a doctoral student at mit at bell labs and princeton he developed the modern theory of transients hazards in logic networks and formulated the concept of operating modes of sequential circuits his stanford research focuses on logic testing synthesis design for testability and fault tolerant computing prof mccluskey and his students at the center for reliable computing worked out many key ideas for fault equivalence probabilistic modeling of logic networks pseudo exhaustive testing and watchdog processors he collaborated with signetics researchers in developing one of the first practical multivalued logic implementations and then worked out a design technique for such circuitry edward j mccluskey biography prof mccluskey received his ab physics math summa cum laude from bowdoin college in 1949 bs and ms ee from mit in 1953 and sc d ee from mit in 1956 he was born in town nj on october 16 1929 a more detailed biography can be found at http www crc stanford edu users ejm mccluskey_edward html the mccluskey tree covering all phds supervised by prof mccluskey by his students and by his grand students can be found at http www db stanford edu pub voy museum mccluskeytree html positions 1955 1959 technical staff electronic telephone office design bell telephone laboratories whippany nj 1959 1966 prof of electrical engineering and director of the university computer center princeton univ 1966 2004 prof depts of electrical engineering and computer science stanford univ ca awards medals and prizes 1965 ieee fellow for contributions to switching theory and engineering education 1967 aaas american association for the advancement of science fellow 1984 ieee computer society technical achievement award in testing 1984 ieee centennial medal 1990 acm annual award for computer science education 1990 euro asic 90 prize for fundamental outstanding contribution to logic synthesis 1991 ieee computer society taylor l booth education award 1994 acm association for computing machinery fellow 1996 ieee emanuel r piore award for pioneering and fundamental contributions to design automation fault tolerant computing 1998 stanford university school of engineering dean's award for academic excellence 1998 member national academy of engineering nae for contributions to logic design computer engineering and engineering education 1999 ieee vts vlsi test symposium best panel award 2002 ieee vts vlsi test symposium best panel award 2002 ieee test technology technical council life time contribution medal in testing honorary phds 1994 univ of grenoble france 2002 bowdoin college ma papers more than 316 refereed journal and conference papers a more detailed list of the publications up to 2001 can be found at http www crc stanford edu users ejm pubs html books 1965 introduction to the theory of switching circuits mcgraw hill ny 1965 1975 design of digital computers springer verlag ny 1975 with hw gschwind 1986 logic design principles prentice hall nj 1986
