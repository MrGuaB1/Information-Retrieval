acta beads and comet tails the picture represents a serial image sequence captured every thirty seconds of 5 micron bead coated with the acta protein of listeria monocytogenes the bead has been superimposed over a photo of the fluorescent actin comet tail which propels the bead forward just as it would propel listeria to see this movie 140k click here more can be found by clicking here 1 mb this motility is highly dependent on the surface density of acta on the beads however average velocity is not larger beads are less likely to break their symmetry and start to move than smaller ones but by coating the beads asymmetrically with a low angle shadowing technique developed in this lab larger particles can move breaking of symmetry from a uniformly coated sphere to a moving bead with a comet tail has been studied and modeled revealing heretofore unpredicted cooperative properties of actin based motility cameron lisa a matthew footer alexander van oudenaarden and julie a theriot 1999 motility of acta protein coated microspheres driven by actin polymerization proceedings of the national academy of sciences 96 4908 4913
