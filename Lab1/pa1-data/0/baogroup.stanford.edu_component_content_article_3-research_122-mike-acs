effect of surface chemistry on electronic properties of carbon nanotube network thin film transistors bao research group stanford university home people current alumni new member research research topics archived news wikilab lab members only publications press contact us visitors abstract thin films of single walled carbon nanotubes swnts are a viable nanomaterial for next generation sensors transistors and electrodes for solar cells and displays despite their remarkable properties challenges in synthesis and processing have hindered integration in current electronics challenges include the inability to precisely assemble and control the deposition of swnt films on a variety of surfaces and the lack of understanding of the transport properties of these films here we utilize an optimized dry transfer technique that facilitates the complete intact transfer of swnt films between different surfaces we then show the effect of surface chemistry on the electronic properties of swnt films by isolating the effect of the surface we gain insight into the fundamental transport properties of swnts on surfaces with different chemical functionalities thin film transistor tft characteristics corroborated with raman spectroscopy show that by using different surface chemical functionalities it is possible to alter the electronic properties of swnt films this opens up another route to tune the electronic properties of integrated swnt films full paper at http pubs acs org doi abs 10.1021 nn1012226 copyright 2009 2011 all rights reserved credits bao group benjamin tee soumen barmen logo by benjamin tee
