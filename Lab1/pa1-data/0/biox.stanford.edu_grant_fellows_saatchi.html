bio x stanford university sanaz saatchi bioengineering amgen fellow professors charles taylor bioengineering and paul yock bioengineering abdominal aortic aneurysms aaa are a life threatening degenerative disease a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms that lead to aneurysm formation is essential for the development of effective preventative therapies through the use of a novel high resolution imaging technology coupled with computational analysis and molecular biology techniques sanaz's work with the laboratories of charles taylor and paul yock will characterize the three dimensional nanometric tissue structure changes and biological events occurring within a blood vessel wall during aneurysm development in an unprecedented manner these studies will improve their understanding of aneurysm development and may assist in the identification of potential therapeutic targets fellowships
