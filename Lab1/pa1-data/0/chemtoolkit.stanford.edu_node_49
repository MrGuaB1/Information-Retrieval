cryogenic liquids laboratory chemical safety toolkit home cryogenic liquids click here for the general use standard operating procedure for cryogenic liquids summary the risks associated with the use of laboratory chemicals must be well understood prior to their use in an experiment as many chemicals have multiple hazards ensure to review the safety guidance for all hazard classes that may apply definition cryogenic liquids are materials with extremely low boiling points ie less than 150 f characteristics one special property of both cryogenic liquids and dry ice is that they undergo substantial volume expansion when converted to a gas phase which can potentially lead to an oxygen deficient atmosphere where ventilation is limited few cryogenic liquids can also pose additional hazards including toxicity and flammability ie liquid carbon monoxide examples cryogenic liquids used in stanford university laboratories include liquid nitrogen helium and argon dry ice is the common term for frozen carbon dioxide back to top search content content introduction getting started your responsibilities pi laboratory supervisor laboratory personnel safety training prior approval and special precautions medical surveillance safe lab practices creating standard operating procedures lab safety basics fume hood use personal protective equipment chemical storage labeling & inventory restricted chemicals & high risk procedures laboratory inspections chemical waste disposal emergencies spills or exposures emergencies spills or exposures health threatening non health threatening small spills local clean up incident reporting reference info chemical hazard classes carcinogens compressed gases corrosive materials cryogenic liquids flammable and combustible liquids highly acutely toxic chemicals highly reactive unstable materials irritants reproductive toxins sensitizers restricted chemicals laboratory chemical safety sheets material safety data sheets stanford lab safety sheets toxnet 2007 stanford university all rights reserved
