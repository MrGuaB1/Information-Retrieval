bio x stanford university katy keenan mechanical engineering & radiology profs scott delp bioengineering mechanical engineering garry gold radiology and gary beaupre mechanical engineering bio x graduate student fellowships 2006 2007 the goal of katy's work is to better diagnose cartilage health enabling early detection of diseases such as osteoarthritis currently because cartilage disease cannot be diagnosed early there is no metric of cartilage health to non invasively evaluate restorative therapies she is combining magnetic resonance imaging techniques with mechanical testing of ex vivo cartilage to develop a correlation between imaging parameters and mechanical properties of cartilage several of the novel mri techniques she is using eg sodium t1rho and bound pool fraction maps are being developed at stanford she will translate the correlation between imaging parameters and mechanical properties to in vivo imaging of human patients fellowships
