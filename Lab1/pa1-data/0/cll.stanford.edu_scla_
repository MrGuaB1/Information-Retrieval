computational learning laboratory cognitive systems laboratory research people courses seminar ml list contact seminar on computational learning and adaptation goals current schedule past schedules directions goals of the seminar for well over a decade research on computational approaches to learning and adaptation has been viewed as a central topic in many disciplines including artificial intelligence molecular biology cognitive psychology complexity theory decision theory pattern recognition and statistics unfortunately researchers in these paradigms do not communicate with each other as often as they might leading to duplicated effort and missed insights that can come from interdisciplinary exchange the seminar on computational learning and adaptation is designed to improve communication among the local researchers who have interests in computational approaches to learning and adaption broadly defined talks cover a variety of representations for learned knowledge logical expressions neural networks stored cases and probabilistic summaries to name a few and report different approaches to evaluation applied experimental theoretical and psychological open discussion aims to establish a common language and increase the chances of future collaborations this seminar was replaced by the cognitive systems seminar in 2008
