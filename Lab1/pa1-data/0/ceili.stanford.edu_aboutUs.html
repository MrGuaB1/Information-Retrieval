stanford ceili about us about us stanford ceili was begun as a student dance group at stanford university but is pleased to have expanded to also include new and experienced dancers from all over the bay area we are an official dance group on campus and practice every week in a lovely studio with wooden floors although our emphasis is on social dancing and fun occasionally our more experienced dancers perform at local campus events check out our videos to see and see performances below to learn more to encourage a positive and casual environment we do not require any commitment from our members but of course would love to have you dance us every week if possible our lessons are very hands on with mostly dancing and little standing and watching and be prepared to be jumping and moving the last week of every month is our dance only day to give members a chance to practice dances learned earlier and have more fun regarding performaces while stanford ceili is primarily a social dance group we do get occasionally invited to perform at various dance events our performances draw heavily on dances we learn in our regular tuesday sessions so we expect that members interested in performing will work on proper footwork and choreography and thus should attend sessions regularly in addition we rehearse outside of our usual tuesday evening time usually directly afterward and performers are expected to commit to rehearsals how to perform with us if you are interested in performing please talk to one of the instructors after the lesson or email danya at dvolkov stanford edu we also send announcements to the mailing list about upcoming performance opportunities as they come up our dances follow link to a list of dances we do
