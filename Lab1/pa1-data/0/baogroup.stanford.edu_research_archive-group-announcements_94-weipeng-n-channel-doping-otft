air stable n channel otfts bao research group stanford university home people current alumni new member research research topics archived news wikilab lab members only publications press contact us visitors we present here the development of a new solution processable n type dopant n dmbi our experimental results demonstrated that a well known n channel semiconductor 6 6 phenyl c61 butyric acid methyl ester pcbm can be effectively doped with n dmbi by solution processing the film conductivity is significantly increased by n type doping we utilized this n type doping for the first time to improve the air stability of n channel organic thin film transistors in which the doping can compensate for the electron traps our successful demonstration of n type doping using n dmbi opens up new opportunities for the development of air stable n channel semiconductors it is also potentially useful for application on solution processed organic light emitting diodes and organic photovoltaics paper download http pubs acs org doi abs 10.1021 ja103173m copyright 2009 2011 all rights reserved credits bao group benjamin tee soumen barmen logo by benjamin tee
