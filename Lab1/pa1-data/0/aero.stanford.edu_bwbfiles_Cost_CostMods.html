cost subroutine update old versions of pass use the ata cost model the cost subroutine is updated to permit comparison with results produced at nasa langley the modifications fall in three categories new values for existing parameters additional parameters and additional calculations details for each of these categories are provided in this document information used in making these adjustments was obtained from marcus mcelroy at nasa langley new values for existing parameters parameter old new units fuel pergal 0.75 0.70 us gal laborrate 30.0 25.0 man hour insurerate 2.0 0.35 of initial aircraft cost new parameters inputs tripsperyear residual annualinterestrate paymentsperyear inflationrate outputs utilization initialloan paymentsize presentvalue financecost unused the following values were provided by nasa langley but do not fit the ata model used in pass and may not be needed fuel density 6.70 lbs gal maintenance overhead rate 200 direct labor spares airframe 6 of initial aircraft cost engine 23 of initial aircraft cost new calculations depreciation & utilization the method of calculating physical depreciation of the value of the aircraft asset incorporates a value for utilization for which nasa langley provided an explicit valuein units of trips year the ata utilization block hrs year value is computed using a statistical relationship between an aircraft's typical block time for each trip and the number of such trips it makes per year a curve fit to this statistical model is currently in pass however since the number of trips per year is specified for the bwb it is possible to simply multiply this value by the block time to determine the ata utilization as follows tcr d ka 20 dc dd vc dc 25hrs 774 ft sec 696600 ft 114 n mi 99 st miles dd 25hrs 774 ft sec 114 n mi 99 st miles vc 774 ft sec 527.7 st miles hr ka airway distance increment 0.02 d 0.02 4000 80 n mi 70 st miles tcr 4000 70 20 99 99 527.7 7.37 hours tblock 7.37 hours tgm tcl td tam 7.37 25 25 25 1 8.23 hours annualized utilization predicted by ata method for bwb 4525 hours year annualized utilization based on given trips year for bwb 8.23 480 3950 hours year to use utilization value provided by nasa the cost subroutine must be modified to allow the number of trips per year to be explicitly entered to do this a variable named tripsperyear was introduced into pass this is an input only value if it remains at its default zero value then the utilization variable remains calculated by statistical fit if the tripsperyear value is non zero then it is calculated by multiplication with the block time the previous pass depreciation formula is expressed as a function which includes the depreciation period da and the ata utilization u in the denominator cam f 1 da u this formulation assumes that residual aircraft value is 0.0 of initial aircraft cost nasa reports that for the bwb the residual is expected to be 10.0 after a depreciation period of 15 yrs to account for this the above formulation is modified as follows cam f 1 da u residual ct da where residual is a new variable to be added to the database and ct is total aircraft cost including engines financing the financing model assumes continuously compounded interest and payments of equal size using the equal payment series capital recovery formulation see engineering economy thuesen gj fabrycky wj prentice hall 1989 the user may specify the number of payments to be made each year but the model assumes that all these payments will be equal the model computes the present value of the payments over the life of the loan using the provided inflation rate note that this annual inflationrate is distinct from the inflation factor used in the ata model to adjust 1967 values to reflect current values the difference between presentvalue and the initialloan which is assumed equal to the total initial purchase cost is the total cost of the financing this value divided by annualized utilization loan period blockv equals the cost of financing per mile financecost new subroutine the new subroutine cost f is listed here
