bending in 2 planes bending in 2 planes parametric form assuming small deflections and no torsion parametric form where condensed deflection in y & z sensor 1 sensor 2 x 1 x 2 l 15cm tip deflection y x z cross section at sensors y z x known at u 0 at u 1 seven unknowns remain curvature information assuming no torsion the orientation of the local and global coordinate frames are the same from each known curvature component we have an equation with 5 unknowns for example at u 1 therefore at each sensor two orthogonal components of curvature are known and 2 equations with 5 unknowns result y x a1x a2x a3x a2y a3y and z x a1x a2x a3x a2z a3z therefore two sets of curvatures are needed to simplify math assume small deflections in y and z such that then we have rid of 3 more unknowns x coefficients simplified derivatives the parametric slope equations are now the parametric curvature equations are now parametric equations in terms of x substitute in for u parametric derivatives in terms of x slope equations curvature equations now the equations to solve for the four remaining unknown coefficients are simple y x and z x are the known orthogonal components of the curvature at the sensor locations and at the tip model find y x at sensor locations calculate a set of unknowns for the region from the base to x2 second sensor location estimate y x2 and y x2 use y x2 y x2 and y l to calculate a set of unknowns from the region from x2 to the tip of the needle
