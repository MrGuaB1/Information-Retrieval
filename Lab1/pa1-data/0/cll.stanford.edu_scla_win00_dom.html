learning seminar seminar on computational learning and adaptation an information theoretic measure of clustering accuracy byron e dom information management principles ibm almaden research center san jose california dom almaden ibm com the most commonly encountered unsupervised learning problem is that of clustering the question of how one measures the accuracy of clustering results does not have a straightforward answer in most situations however we propose a measure of clustering quality or accuracy that is appropriate in situations where it is desirable to evaluate a clustering algorithm by somehow comparing the clusters it produces with ground truth consisting of classes assigned to the patterns by manual means or some other means in whose veracity there is confidence such measures are referred to as external our measure also has the characteristic of allowing partitions with different numbers of clusters to be compared in a quantitative and principled way our evaluation scheme quantitatively measures how useful the cluster labels of the patterns are as predictors of their class labels in cases where all partitions to be compared have the same number of clusters the measure is equivalent to the mutual information between the cluster labels and the class labels in cases where the numbers of clusters are different however it computes the reduction in the number of bits that would be required to encode compress the class labels if both the encoder and decoder have free access to the cluster labels to achieve this encoding the estimated conditional probabilities of the class labels given the cluster labels must also be encoded these estimated probabilities can be seen as a model for the class labels and their associated code length as a model cost date thurs march 9 2000 time 4 15 5 30pm place ventura 17 return to the seminar schedule
