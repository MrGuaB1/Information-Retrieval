program for aircraft synthesis studies mission analysis and optimization pass program for aircraft synthesis studies this section contains java applets for analysis of transport aircraft the system is based on caffe a cooperative applet framework for engineering you may analyze the airplane or investigate the effects of changing various parameters as you enter various parameters in the different sections of this program they are saved and passed to other pages this section collects all of the information entered previously and computes the overall aircraft performance alternatively you may view all of the inputs at once by going to the summary of project inputs in the appendix from this page you can reload or copy a complete description of your current design start by looking at the effects of wing area and take off weight changes to your design on the performance trade studies page several additional options are available at the links listed below pass introduction page mission analysis summary of complete mission performance information on the variables a description units how they are computed numerical optimization lets you vary several parameters at once to find the best design a simple top view drawing of your airplane a 3 d view of the geometry and an expert system that suggests what may be done to improve the design
