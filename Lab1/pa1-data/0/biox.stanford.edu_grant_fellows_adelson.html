bio x stanford university jaimie adelson neurosciences bio x graduate student fellowships 2010 2011 honorary bio x fellow professor carla shatz biology neurobiology our brains have the remarkable ability to change and learn the cerebral cortex has intrinsic mechanisms that limit or promote plasticity by converting neural activity into lasting structural changes at synapses jaimie considers the model that in neurons two major histocompatibility complex class i genes kb and db signaling via the innate immune receptor pirb act as a brake on cortical plasticity the goal of her research is to release the brake in mutant mice lacking these molecules and examine if it is possible to not only increase cortical plasticity but also to promote faster recovery following acute cortical injury fellowships
