wing lift distributions wing lift distributions as in the design of airfoil sections it is easier to relate the wing geometry to its performance through the intermediary of the lift distribution wing design often proceeds by selecting a desirable wing lift distribution and then finding the geometry that achieves this distribution in this section we describe the lift and lift coefficient distributions and relate these to the wing geometry and performance about wing lift and c l distributions relating wing geometry and lift distribution lift distributions and performance
