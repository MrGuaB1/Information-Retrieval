photonics in ulsi based system page 1 photonics in ulsi based system yoshio nishi ee where would photonics be back plane to board board to chip chip to chip on chip page 2 convergence of optics & electronics nature of electrical optical components photons are good for communication electrons are good for computation and control electrical optical components for personal internet products will provide electronic control of optical communication signals eo and oe conversion dennis buss isscc 2001 photons are good for communication electrons are good for computation and control electrical optical components for personal internet products will provide electronic control of optical communication signals eo and oe conversion dennis buss isscc 2001 page 3 technology push solutions beyond copper low k in silicon based mainstream cmos material innovation with traditional scaling may no longer satisfy projected performance requirements novel design packaging and global interconnect solutions needed what are the options optical rf guided and or free space low temperature 3d interconnects page 4 key questions for on chip photonics integration at the same level of silicon ic circa circa early 60's does integrated circuits really need photonics solution do we have transmitter and receiver available on silicon based cmos any possibility at integrated package page 5 back up slide page 6 demand pull optical i o optical source modulation rates above 20ghz doable with direct modulation optical source drive voltages and mating with transistor voltages 1v or less bias for optical sources drive electronics in cmos for 10ghz modulation rates packaging heat sink ball grid array where do optical elements reside at highspeeds want to get rid of two separate packages how are the chips integrated
