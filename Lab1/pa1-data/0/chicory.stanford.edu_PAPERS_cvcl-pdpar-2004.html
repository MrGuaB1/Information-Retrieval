a practical approach to partial functions in cvc lite a practical approach to partial functions in cvc lite sergey berezin clark barrett igor shikanian marsha chechik arie gurfinkel and david l dill pdpar 04 most verification approaches assume a mathematical formalism in which functions are total even though partial functions occur naturally in many applications furthermore although there have been various proposals for logics of partial functions there is no consensus on which is the right logic to use for verification applications in this paper we propose using a three valued kleene logic where partial functions return the undefined value when applied outside of their domains the particular semantics are chosen according to the principle of least surprise to the user if there is disagreement among the various approaches on what the value of the formula should be its evaluation is undefined we show that the problem of checking validity in the three valued logic can be reduced to checking validity in a standard two valued logic and describe how this approach has been successfully implemented in our tool cvc lite
