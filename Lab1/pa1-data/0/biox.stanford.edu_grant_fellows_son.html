bio x stanford university min sun son bio x bioengineering graduate fellow 2007 professor marc levenston mechanical engineering min sun's work in the soft tissue biomechanics laboratory under dr marc levenston involves studying gene expressions of various proteins such as collagen aggrecan and aggrecanase in the immature and mature bovine menisci these proteins are known to have important roles in meniscus degeneration the meniscus does not have much regenerative capabilities and has been correlated with cartilage degeneration or osteoarthritis therefore comparing the protein expression levels in mature and immature tissue will provide helpful insight in fully understanding the mechanism of degeneration she is also looking at different regions in the meniscus which are subject to different kinds of mechanical forces in the knee fellowships
