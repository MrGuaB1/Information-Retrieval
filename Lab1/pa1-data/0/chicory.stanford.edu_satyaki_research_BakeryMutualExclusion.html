bakery mutual exclusion bakery mutual exclusion the bakery mutual exclusion algorithm has been extensively cited in papers it appears in papers written by saidi the stanford step project and also in papers on predicate abstraction by lakhneche spelling et al the version used here comes from the paper automated deductive verification of parallel systems presented by saidi in nasa langley formal methods workshop 1997 the same algorithm is also studied in model checking and deduction for infinite state systems presented by sipma uribe and manna in csli 2001 our system can proves this example automatically bakery mutual exclusion algorithm murphi program state variables global state y1 rat pc1 rat y2 rat pc2 rat initialization initialize progn setq y1 0 setq y2 0 setq pc1 1 setq pc2 1 rules for process 1 rules true skip pc1 1 progn setq y1 y2 1 setq pc1 2 and pc1 2 or y2 0 y1 y2 setq pc1 3 pc1 3 progn setq y1 0 setq pc1 1 rules for process 2 rules pc2 1 progn setq y2 y1 1 setq pc2 2 and pc2 2 or y1 0 y2 y1 setq pc2 3 pc2 3 progn setq y2 0 setq pc2 1 the mutual exclusion invariant invariant not and pc1 3 pc2 3 the abstraction abstraction initial predicates b0 pc1 3 b1 pc2 3 iteration 1 c01 0 1 y1 1 y2 0 iteration 2 c02 pc2 2 iteration 3 c03 pc1 2 iteration 4 c04 1 1 y1 0 iteration 5 c05 not 1 1 y1 0 iteration 6 c06 y1 0 iteration 7 c07 y2 0 iteration 8 c08 y2 0 satyaki das last modified wed may 7 15 30 21 pdt 2003
