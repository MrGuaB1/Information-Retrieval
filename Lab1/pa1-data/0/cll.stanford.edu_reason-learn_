reasoning and learning in cognitive systems reasoning and learning in cognitive systems cs 379b previously cs 329 topics in artificial intelligence stanford university winter 2006 this course counts toward elective credit in ai for cs masters students with an advisor's approval and as an advanced small seminar for symbolic systems students hard copy readings will be available in a box outside gates 222 for those who could not pick them up in class course instructor pat langley langley csli stanford edu computational learning laboratory center for the study of language and information stanford university stanford ca 94305 650 723 8260 course summary one ability that distinguishes humans from other organisms is their ability to handle tasks that require reasoning and problem solving humans also exhibit learning on such problems in that they improve this ability with experience unfortunately recent research on computational learning has focused on tasks like classification and reactive control which in their standard forms do not require reasoning yet uncovering the relationship between reasoning and learning seems central to understanding the nature of intelligence this course will examine the intersection of reasoning problem solving and learning from a computational perspective we will cover material from the literatures on both artificial intelligence and cognitive science with an aim to understanding common principles that underly human and computer reasoning as well as their differences each meeting will combine a lecture on key ideas with group discussion of papers that describe implemented systems that reason and learn our aim will be to understand in computational terms how one can represent utilize and acquire knowledge for use in reasoning and problem solving course logistics time tuesdays and thursdays 1 00 pm 2 15 pm note time change location gates 260 office hours gates 222 tuesdays and thursdays 2 15 pm 2 45 pm or by appointment course web site http cll stanford edu reason learn course schedule and syllabus http cll stanford edu reason learn schedule html course assignments downloads and programming help http cll stanford edu reason learn assign html prerequisites course prerequisites include a basic familiarity with concepts from artificial intelligence and cognitive science the class will involve some programming but students from outside computer science should not feel daunted we will use a high level language that does not require experience with traditional programming formalisms and that is much easier to learn however participants should be able to think computationally in terms of symbolic or logical knowledge structures and the mechanisms that operate on them most important they should be interested in the mechanisms that underlie both performance and learning in reasoning and problem solving assignments and grading the course will interleave formal lectures with discussions of papers from the relevant literature to ensure that participants have digested the material they must except for the first meeting bring one question that arose from their reading of each assigned paper which we will use to direct discussion participants will also complete exercises that involve building four distinct types of reasoning systems which they should turn in at the beginning of the meeting for which they are due each student will also have a total of four free late days to use as he sees fit on the assignments once these late days are exhausted we will penalize any exercises turned after its due date at the rate of 20 percent per calendar day late or fraction thereof participants grades will be based on the correctness of their answers to exercises 15 percent each or 60 percent taken together and on their contributions to class discussion including their questions 40 percent readings there does not exist a textbook on the content of this course thus reading assignments will come from the broader literature in ai cognitive science and machine learning when possible we will provide urls for papers on the course web site when these are not available we will pass out hard copies in the meeting before the one in which we discuss the reading if you would like more information about the course send electronic mail to langley csli stanford edu
