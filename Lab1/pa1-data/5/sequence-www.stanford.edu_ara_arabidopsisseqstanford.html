arabidopsis sequencing at stanford sequencing of the arabidopsis thaliana genome at the stanford dna sequence and technology center the arabidopsis genome sequencing has been completed with publication of the sequencing and analysis papers in nature the ssp spp ssp now that dr ecker has moved from u penn to the salk institute consortium is now sequencing arabidopsis full length cdna clones dr joseph ecker leads this effort his group has set up the main web site for the cdna sequencing the arabidopsis genome initiative agi has recently been launched to complete sequencing of the 120 mb arabidopsis genome by the year 2001 with the participation of 7 laboratories from the united states 17 from the european union and one from japan the stanford dna sequence and technology center is participating in the agi as a member of the spp consortium composed of our group here at stanford led by ron davis and nancy federspiel the arabidopsis thaliana genome center of joseph ecker at the university of pennsylvania and the genome sequencing laboratory of athanasios theologis at the plant gene expression center uc berkeley the initial efforts of the spp consortium will focus on sequencing bac clones from chromosome 1 information about arabidopsis sequencing at stanford arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence has been completed theologis a ecker jr palm cj federspiel na et al and davis rw 2000 sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant arabidopsis thaliana nature 408 6814 816 20 the arabidopsis genome initiative agi 2000 analysis of the genome of the flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana nature 408 6814 796 815 the web pages that were associated with this site are no longer being maintained and have been retired as of jan 2003 please visit tair to view the current version of the arabidopsis genome and annotation please visit signal salk's web site for information about the status of the ssp's arabidopsis cdna project including a searchable database of cdna clone status for the entire consortioum for information about this site email
