spin squeezed state qwiki spin squeezed state from qwiki jump to navigation search spin squeezed states sss are collective spin states defined as follows first consider an individual spin i with the vector spin operator the individual spin operators have the commutation relations for two operators a and b we have the general uncertainty relation now consider the collective spin vector operators using the definition of the collective spin components and the general uncertainty relation we get the collective spin uncertainty relations now consider a spin state with all spins aligned along the x axis this separable state is referred to as a coherent spin state css and has where f nf is unitless despite the fact that all spins are aligned as well as possible there remains uncertainty in the transverse directions y and z due to the final uncertainty relation above in which the last term is zero by symmetry for the css these uncertainties are equal for a spin squeezed state one of these uncertainties is decreased while the other necessarily increases eg while the spin squeezing parameter for a state aligned along x and squeezed along z is defined as for a css  2 1 in contrast a spin squeezed state is defined as a state with and  2 1 by this definition it has been shown that spin squeezed states are necessarily entangled references masahiro kitagawa and masahito ueda squeezed spin states 1993 research groups mabuchi lab polzik lab aliases sss squeezed spin state retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php spin_squeezed_state categories concept quantum state views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 20 july 2011 at 00 37 this page has been accessed 20697 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
