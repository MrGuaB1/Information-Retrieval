rickett & lumley cross equalizing 4 d data next up print clean next introduction up table of contents a cross equalization processing flow for off the shelf 4 d seismic data james rickett and david lumley abstract seismic reservoir monitoring is a new technology that involves interpreting differences between different generations of 3 d seismic data in terms of changes in reservoir properties over time a vast number of 3 d seismic surveys are repeated in whole or in part for reasons other than reservoir monitoring in this paper we cross equalize two off the shelf migrated datacubes over a gulf of mexico field with favorable reservoir properties to see whether their time lapse nature can be exploited for reservoir monitoring purposes key elements in the processing flow include spatial realignment to a common grid wavelet equalization by l 2 matched filtering warping to compensate for different stacking migration velocities and amplitude balancing a balance is struck between global and local operators to ensure a clean cross equalization result without inadvertently removing changes due to fluid production introduction gulf of mexico example spatial realignment matched filtering amplitude balancing warping warping as residual migration separating kinematics and dynamics results conclusions acknowledgements references about this document next up print clean next introduction up table of contents stanford exploration project 7 5 1998
