the comb function next up previous print clean next undersampled field data up correlation and spectra previous two ways to compute the comb function consider a constant function of time in the frequency domain it is an impulse at zero frequency the comb function is defined to be zero at alternate time points multiply this constant function by the comb function the resulting signal contains equal amounts of two frequencies half is zero frequency and half is nyquist frequency we see this in the second row in figure 12 where the nyquist energy is in the middle of the frequency axis in the third row 3 out of 4 points are zeroed by another comb we now see something like a new nyquist frequency at half the nyquist frequency visible on the second row comb figure 12 a zero frequency function and its cosine transform successive rows show increasingly sparse sampling of the zero frequency function view next up previous print clean next undersampled field data up correlation and spectra previous two ways to compute stanford exploration project 3 1 2001
