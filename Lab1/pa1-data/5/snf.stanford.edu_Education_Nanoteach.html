education k 12 programs nanoleap education k 12 programs nanoteach snf is again partnering with mid continent research for education and learning mcrel and aspen associates on an nsf grant after the successful nanoleap program along with our nnin partners at gerogia tech in this program we will develop nanoteach a combination of face to face and online professional development experiences for high school science teachers who teach physical science topics nanoteach will increase teachers nanoscale science and technology content knowledge and their repertoire of content specific instructional strategies nanoteach will build upon a previous successful nsf funded project a nanoleap into new science using what we learned about the development process itself and incorporating nanoleap instructional materials nanoteach will use instructional materials and professional development findings from other nsf funded nanoscale science and technology ns&t projects and staff from these projects will serve on the nanoteach advisory board the primary goal of nanoteach is to prepare teachers to use an instructional design framework to integrate ns&t content into their curriculum in significant ways to achieve this goal we will develop and test a professional development model that combines 1 an instructional design framework designing effective science lessons a three part instructional design framework cue that helps teachers address content c student understanding u and learning environments e 2 nanoscale science content from nanoleap nanosense and the nclt and 3 multiple delivery methods face to face meetings asynchronous online assignments and synchronous sessions with cutting edge instructor controlled online video technology teachers engaged in nanoteach will learn to design and implement lesson plans and assessments using the designing effective science lessons cue framework teacher learning goals are to learn to 1 integrate ns&t content 2 use instructional strategies that have a high correlation to student understanding and 3 create learning environments that help students conducting scientific inquiries one of the snf team's main responsibilities on the project is content expertise as content experts the stanford team advises on concepts to include in the curriculum and checks curriculum materials for scientific accuracy the snf nanoteach team the other main contribution that snf is making to the project is remote access capabilities high resolution web cameras are used to give live webcast tours of the snf and georgia tech cleanrooms in addition we will provide a virtual lab demonstration showing how carbon nanotubes are produced analyzed and imaged in one of our labs finally discussions with nanoscience researchers technicians and educators will be offered live over the web with our workshop participants back to top home sitemap search stanford nanofabrication facility webmaestro snf stanford edu last modified 06 11 2009 r7 pdf target _blank alt 7 gowning and clean rooms
