rational filters next up previous print clean next instability up damped oscillation previous spectrum of a pole rational filters a general model for filtering includes both convolution numerator z transforms and feedback filtering denominator z transforms 40 there are a variety of ways to implement equation 40 in a computer we could do the polynomial division x z a z first and then multiply convolve with b z or we could do the multiplication first and the division later alternately we could do them simultaneously if we identified coefficients of a z y z b z x z and solved for recursive equations as we did for 34 the rational filter is more powerful than either a purely numerator filter or a purely denominator filter because like its numerator part the rational filter can easily destroy any frequency totally and like its denominator part it can easily enhance any frequency without limit finite difference solutions of differential equations often appear as rational filters exercises consider equation 40 what time domain recurrence analogous to equation 34 is implied next up previous print clean next instability up damped oscillation previous spectrum of a pole stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
