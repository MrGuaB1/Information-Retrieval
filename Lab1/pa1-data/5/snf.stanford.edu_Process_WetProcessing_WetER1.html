wet etch processes etch rates wet etch rates for various non metal films these etch rates were performed at snf on films that were processed here etch rates are listed in units of angstroms per minute and represent only approximate values note that etch rates are dependent on etchant temperature age and history as well as conditions of film growth or deposition 6 1 buff hf 20 1 buff hf 50 1 hf 10 1 hf hot phos h 2 o 2 al etch pad etch freckle etch thermal oxide 910 300 50 280 10 10 385 73 lto undensified 2900 740 300 a 920 10 10 2370 459 4 undensified 4340 1000 350 2000 16 10 4278 2530 8 undensified 6000 1650 600 3300 30 10 5561 2970 lto densified 1400 400 87 715 10 10 642 91 4 densified 1625 490 90 1460 10 1560 1355 8 densified 2900 725 290 1500 10 10 3120 2385 std nitride 10 10 10 36 35 43 low stress nitride 10 10 10 40 32 148 undoped poly 10 10 265 for the nitride wafers when a 1600a stress sample was used 68a were stripped off in the first minute and 4a after that however when a 300a sample was used 8a were removed in the first minute and each additional minute thereafter low stress nitride in pad etch 337a in the first minute and 4a thereafter hot phosphorus was 152c aluminum etch was 40c a correction by brian greene 6 14 01 back to top previous page snf home processes page stanford nanofabrication facility last modified 08 29 2003
