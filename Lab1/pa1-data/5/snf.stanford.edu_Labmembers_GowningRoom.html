gowning room policy bunnysuit management in the gowning room the bunnysuit management policies described here are our attempt to minimize the number of suits that are stored in the gowning room and to keep more clean suits in circulation we ask that all labmembers help to keep the gowning room tidy by abiding by these guidelines bunnysuits should be stored on labeled hangers and hung in alphabetical order by coral login if everyone is diligent about storing hangers in alphabetical order it should be a lot easier for you to find your own personal bunnysuit in a room full of identical suits as a general rule if you do not plan to work in the cleanroom for an extended period of time about a month please recycle your bunnysuit by placing it in the laundry bin this will help keep clean bunnysuits in circulation and minimize clutter in the gowning room you may keep your hanger in the gowning room periodically staff members will sort through the hangers and remove bunnysuits and hangers from labmembers who have been away from the lab any questions or comments regarding gowning room procedures can be directed to staff members back to top home sitemap search stanford nanofabrication facility webmaestro snf stanford edu last modified 08 29 2003
