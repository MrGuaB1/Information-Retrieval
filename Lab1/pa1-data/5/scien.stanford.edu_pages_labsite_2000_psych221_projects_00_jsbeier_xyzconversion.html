rgb to xyz conversion xyz conversion the next step in removing the influence of our image taking device from the image data is to convert from linear rgb values to xyz space this is a simple linear transformation gained by solving for rgb2xyz in the equation xyz 3xn rgb2xyz 3x3 rgb 3xn in matlab notation this becomes rgb2xyz inv rgb xyz we use the entire set of data taken from the macbeth colorchecker to get the most precise transformation matrix available to us the rgb matrix is the set of linearized rgb values given by our gamma correction the xyz matrix is the set of readings taken for each macbeth swatch by the spectroradiometer we find that the transformation matrix rgb2xyz is 0.0028 0.0022 0.0006 0.0016 0.0032 0.0004 0.0001 0.0004 0.0013 we have created a matlab function toxyz m that uses this tranformation matrix to compute xyz values given a set of linear rgb values start back next
