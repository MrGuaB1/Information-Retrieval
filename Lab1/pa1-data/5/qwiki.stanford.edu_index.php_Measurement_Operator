measurement operator qwiki measurement operator from qwiki jump to navigation search the following discussion was largely taken from howard wiseman s thesis section 2.2 we describe both the system and environment as pure states for simplicity the environment is prepared in the state the total state which we assume to be initially separable evolves into the generally entangled form through measurement the environment is projected into a particular state  via the projector so the resulting unnormalized total state is where notice that the measurement operator   dt which acts on only the system subspace is not necessarily a projector also note that this reduction is only useful if the environment has certain dynamical properties if we are to use the same measurement operators for every time step the environment must quickly return to its prepared state equilibrium approximation and never return the measured information to the system markovian approximation of course we may explicitly return information to the system via hamiltonian feedback but here we are considering the open loop dynamics alone dynamics of continuous measurement now we assume the existence of valid measurement operators   dt and work out the dynamics the continuous measurement operators are usually specified as follows with the l i being the so called jump operators with i 1 2 3 and from the kraus normalization condition conditional evolution let us define an effect f i to be associated with a measurement operator through in the simulation of conditional evolution we imagine flipping a coin weighted according to p i tr f i  to get a result i in experiment measure for some period of time to get a result i including the null measurement of i 0 in either case given result i apply the random evolution described by this formalism is referred to as a quantum trajectory unconditional evolution in the case where the measurement record is ignored our best estimate of the system state must be given by the evolution or where is the liouvillian ie lindbladian the average of the conditional trajectories should reproduce this unconditional behavior transforming the measurement formally one can unitarily rearrange the measurement operators without changing the unconditional evolution thus creating what is called a different unravelling of the master equation thus the transformation results in no change of the unconditional evolution where whether or not a particular unraveling is physically realizable is another question for the decaying mode of a cavity different unravelings correspond to different means of detection direct detection results in conditional evolution with jump like behavior but by adding a local oscillator to the output field one can perform a homodyne measurement which in the large oscillator limit results in diffusive motion of the conditional state the switch from direct detection to homodyne or heterodyne corresponds to a unitary re arrangement of the direct detection measurement operators retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php measurement_operator categories quantum measurement concept quantum mechanics views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 13 april 2007 at 18 19 this page has been accessed 8050 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
