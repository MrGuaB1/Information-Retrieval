space weather monitors stanford solar center sid monitors awesome monitors science data obtaining a monitor distribution for educators student center installation and use the team publications references acknowledgements the science behind the monitors what is space weather some conditions in space have the potential to seriously affect us on earth we call these conditions space weather the causes can include radiation storms and ejections from the sun as well disturbances in the earth's magnetic field caused by the sun besides triggering beautiful auroras these solar storms can damage satellites disrupt power grids and electrical systems interfer with cell phones and other communications and disturb animal movements they can even threaten astronauts and high flying airplanes with their radiation about space weather what is a solar sid about 60 km 40 miles above us lies the earth's ionosphere a desolate place where continual blasts of particles and energy from the sun hit our atmosphere so strongly that electrons are stripped away from their nuclei this ionized region where electrons and nuclei run around freely is a plasma which we call the ionosphere the free electrons in the ionosphere have a strong influence on the propagation of radio signals radio frequencies of very long wavelength very low frequency or vlf bounce back off the ionosphere thus conveniently for us allowing radio communication over the horizon and around our curved earth the ionosphere reacts strongly to the intense x ray and ultraviolet radiation released by the sun during a solar flare solar storm or coronal mass ejection by monitoring the signal strength from distant vlf transmitters and noting unusual changes as the waves bounce off the ionosphere we can monitor and track these disturbances to monitor a vlf signal we need a radio receiver which can tune to very low frequency stations an antenna to pick up these vlf signals and a computer to keep track of the data since most consumer radios cannot pick up the very low frequence signals we need to build our own radio receiver and our own antenna this combination of receiver and antenna we call a sudden ionospheric disturbance monitor sid where do we find the vlf radio waves again conveniently for us the us navy uses vlf very low frequency waves to communicate with its submarines they have a collection of transmitters scattered around the country and the earth even though these are many miles away the vlf signals bounce off our ionosphere and can be picked up almost anywhere when you obtain your sid monitor you also recieve a frequency board that is tuned to a particular station which need not be the closest to you you can request frequency boards for other stations as well however to best match up your experiences with the station it's wise to choose one at the same longitude where your sunrise and sunset phenomena will occur at roughly the same time here is a vlf station list how does solar activity affect the ionosphere and hence the vlf waves the effect of solar flares on the vlf radio waves transmitted in the ionosphere a powerpoint presentation developed by sharad khanal to give a basic understanding of the sun's affect on vlf transmission the effect of solar flares on the vlf radio waves transmitted in the ionosphere by sharad khanal a paper to accompany the above powerpoint presentation word document the ionosphere space environment center publication by dave anderson and tim fuller rowell pdf ionospheric information check out the short topic papers on the ionosphere and radio wave propagation vlf waves and earthquakes scientists debate new evidence for electromagnetic earthquake predictors on the possible origin propagation and detectibility of electromagnetic precursors of earthquakes other uses of vlf waves water prospecting and vlf waves radio waves below 22khz stanford solar center contact us permitted uses credits 2008 by stanford solar center
