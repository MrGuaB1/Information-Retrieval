welcome to sc zhang's group dissipationless quantum spin current at room temperature in this animation of a gallium arsenide semiconductor an externally applied electric field induces the spins of electrons to flow collectively in a current the spin current speeds up with increasing electric field the spin flow horizontal along the x axis is perpendicular to both the direction of the electric field vertical along the z axis and the plane of individual or quantum spins horizontal along the y axis
