stanford biomedical optics group stanford biomedical optics group principal investigator audrey k ellerbee ph d home the goal of the stanford biomedical optics sbo research group is to develop and deploy novel tools for optical imaging at the microscale and nanoscale our applications of interest span clinical and basic science domains we also have particular interest in the development of low cost portable technologies suited for use in poorly resourced environments building on our expertise and experience with interferometry we aim to create innovative technologies that serve as integral complements to the toolkits of biologists and clinicians as well as use our own technologies to study various cellular phenomena relevant to disease our research is supported through generous donations and competitive awards from the following sponsors news 01 11 12 prof ellerbee is named a 2012 air force young investigator 01 09 12 prof ellerbee's winter 2012 course biophotonics light in medicine and biology ee331 is open for enrollment 10 21 11 ake to give a talk at the ms&e department colloquium 09 26 11 prof ellerbee's fall 2011 course photonics laboratory ee234 is open for enrollment 09 26 11 sbo to give a poster at the annual bio x symposium 09 18 11 prof ellerbee selected to participate in the usfoe conference of the national academies 09 18 11 contratulations chris 2 abstracts accepted to photonics west 09 01 11 sbo welcomes new rotation students david sebastian and william 06 01 11 sbo welcome summer undergraduate students sindy mitchell and meagan 04 01 11 sbo welcomes chris a new undergraduate researcher 03 09 11 prof ellerbee's spring 2011 course biophotonics light in medicine and biology ee331 is open for enrollment 03 09 11 sbo will present a poster at the cbis symposium on march 11 check us out 03 04 11 sbo was awarded a vpue faculty grant for undergraduate research 01 20 11 congratulations noy and hee yoon passed the ee quals 10 23 10 sbo acknowledges support from amd 09 29 10 sbo welcomes new students noy and kristen 09 01 10 sbo welcomes new students hee yoon tahereh and timnit 09 01 10 sbo was awarded a grant through the 2010 sait gro program 09 01 10 sbo acknowledges funding for infrastructure support from intel colophon and photo credits 2012 stanford biomedical optics group all rights reserved
