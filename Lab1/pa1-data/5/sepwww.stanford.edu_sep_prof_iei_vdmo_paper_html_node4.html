conventional velocity analysis previous up next print clean next mutes and weights up stacking and velocity analysis previous normal moveout nmo conventional velocity analysis a conventional velocity analysis uses a collection of trial velocities each trial velocity is taken to be a constant function of depth and is used to moveout correct the data figure 2 left exhibits the cmp gather of figure 1 left after moveout correction by a constant velocity notice that the events in the middle of the gather are nearly flattened whereas the early events are undercorrected and later events are overcorrected this is typical because the amount of moveout correction varies inversely with velocity by pythagoras and the earth's velocity normally increases with depth a measure of the goodness of fit of the nmo velocity to the earth velocity is found by summing the cdp gather over offset presumably the better the velocities match the better bigger will be the sum the process is repeated for many velocities the amplitude of the sum contoured as a function of time and velocity is shown in figure 2 right cmphale figure 2 nmo at constant velocity with velocity analysis hale view in practice additional steps may be taken before summing the traces may be balanced scaled to be equal in their powers and in their spectra likewise the amplitude of the sum may be normalized and smoothed see taner and koehler 1969 also the data may be edited and weighted as explained in the next subsection the velocity giving the best stack is an average of the earth's velocity above the reflector the precise definition of this average is deferred till later previous up next print clean next mutes and weights up stacking and velocity analysis previous normal moveout nmo stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
