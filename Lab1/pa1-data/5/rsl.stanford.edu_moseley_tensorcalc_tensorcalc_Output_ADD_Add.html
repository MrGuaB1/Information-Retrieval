lattice index a dd a description of the a dd coherence index was just recently published in skare s et al noise considerations in the determination of diffusion tensor anisotropy mri 18 6 659 69 2000 medline citation the a dd coherence index is similar to the lattice anisotropy defined in pierpaoli c and basser pj toward a quantitative assessment of diffusion anisotropy mrm 36 893 906 1996 medline citation these inter voxel anisotropy indices give measures of the degree of collinearity between the eigenvectors in the reference voxel v ri i 1 2 3 and the eigenvectors in neighboring voxels v ni each eigenvector is weighted by the corresponding eigenvalue and the sum of the squares of the dot product between each pair of eigenvectors this is called the tensor dot product between the reference diffusion tensor and the neighboring diffusion tensor and is denoted by a similar tensor dot product can be formed using only the anisotropic part of the diffusion tensor where the italics is used to distinguish the anisotropic part from the entire tensor now the basic element a n dd of the a dd index correlates the reference voxel and any one of the neighboring voxels and is given by a dd is then given by summing the basic elements for all the neighboring voxels weighting their contributions according to their distance from the reference voxel where a n is 1 for voxels that share a side with the reference voxel and 1 sqrt 2 for voxels that only a corner with the reference voxel the difference between the lattice anisotropy index li r and a dd anisotropy index is in the definition of the basic element however simulations and experimental studies showed that a dd is more robust than li in terms of sensitivity to noise see paper by skare et al mentioned above example a dd map
