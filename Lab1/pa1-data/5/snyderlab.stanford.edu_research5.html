snyder lab home page snyder lab research information on the many exciting projects in the snyder lab right now this site is in progress and the information is not up to date please be patient as these pages are slowly updated our laboratory uses global approaches to explore protein function and dissect regulatory networks several of our areas of research are 1 control of cell division and cell morphology in yeast 2 characterization of proteomes 3 analysis of regulatory circuits in yeast 4 characterization of the human genome 5 sex specific gene expression in mammals to better understand the molecular differences between adult males and females in mammals we have analyzed gene expression in kidney liver brain and reproductive tissues in mice and brain tissues in human we have found little sex specific gene expression in the hypothalamus but significant differences in gene expression in the reproductive tissues as expected we also found a number of differences in gene expression in male and female liver and kidney the majority of differentially expressed genes are involved in drug metabolism and osmotic regulation the latter is important for controlling hypertension these results have important implications in understanding the different physiology of males and females and how they lead to different sex specific difference in human health and its control there are many other projects in the lab that don t fall under these broad areas updated by xiyan li email on 2011 03 16 11 15 am
