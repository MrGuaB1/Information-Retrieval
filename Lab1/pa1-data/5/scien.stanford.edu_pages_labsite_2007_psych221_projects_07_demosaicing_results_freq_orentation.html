frequency orientation home introduction motivation & methods experimental setup results conclusion references appendix presentation evaluation of demosaic algorithms psych 211 final project winter 2006 2007 stephanie kwan home introduction motivation & methods experimental setup results conclusion references appendix presentation results frequency orientation test the main purpose of using this test image is to see how well the algorithms remove alising in the red and blue channels figure 1 original frequency orientation image figure 2 demosaicked frequency orientation imge using bilinear interpolation figure 3 demosaicked frequency orientation imge using pcsd figure 4 demosaicked frequency orientation imge using alternating projections the red blue and yellow coloration at the high frequency regions of the demosaicked images are caused by red and blue channels aliasing the main observation from this experiment is that alternating projections is very sucessful in removing red blue channel aliasing demosaicking using bilinear interpolation creates most severe red and blue channel aliasing this shows that red and blue channel aliasing can be removed by exploiting the correlations between the channels test images frequency orientation macbeth color checker slanted edge natural images building chair holes woman design downloaded from freewebtemplates com free web design web templates web layouts and website resources
