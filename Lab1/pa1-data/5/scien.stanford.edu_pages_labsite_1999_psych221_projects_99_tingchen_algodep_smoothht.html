description of bilinear interpolation smooth hue transition interpolation one of the key objection of the bilinear interpolation is that the hues of adjacent pixels change abuptly and in an unnatural manner the bayer cfa pattern on the other hand can be thought of as consisting of a luminance channel the relatively numerous green pixels and a chrominance channel the relative sparse red and blue pixels a scheme can be created to interpolate these channels differently for convenience figure 1 is duplicated here interpolation of green pixels same as in bilinear interpolation also note interpolation of green pixels has to be done before interpolations of red blue pixels interpolation of red blue pixels the idea here is to try to impose a smooth transition in hue from pixel to pixel to do so define blue hue value as b g and red hue value can be analogously defined considering the interpolation of blue pixel values there are three different cases of blue pixel value interpolations estimating blue pixel value at the green position and the adjacent blue pixels are on left and right eg b7 g7 2 b6 g6 b8 g8 estimating blue pixel value at the green position and the adjacent blue pixels are on top and bottom eg b13 g13 2 b8 g8 b18 g18 estimating blue pixel value at the red postion eg b12 g12 4 b6 g6 b8 g8 b16 g16 b18 g18 interpolation of red pixel values can be carried out analogously for reference refer to 3 11 12
