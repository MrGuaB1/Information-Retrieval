weighted voting class prediction weighted voting class prediction protocols build and evaluate class predictors classifiers using the weighted voting class prediction method what would you like to do build and evaluate a classifier evaluate an existing classifier classify an unknown sample using an existing classifier build and evaluate a classifier build and evaluate class predictors classifiers using the weighted voting class prediction method how many gene expression data sets do you have two data sets click here to build a classifier against one data set and evaluate it against the other one large data set if you have one large data set use the splitdatasettraintest module to split it into two data sets then click here to build a classifier against one data set and evaluate it against the other one data set if you have one smaller data set that cannot easily be split click here to build and evaluate classifiers using cross validation evaluate an existing classifier to evaluate an existing weighted voting classifier you must have built the classifier using the weightedvoting module do you have a classifier model file yes click here to evaluate your existing classifier no use the build and evaluate a classifier instructions above to build a classifier classify an unknown sample using an existing classifier to classify an unknown sample you must have built a weighted voting classifier using the weightedvoting module do you have a classifier model file yes click here to classify an unknown sample using your existing classifier no use the build and evaluate a classifier instructions above to build a classifier
