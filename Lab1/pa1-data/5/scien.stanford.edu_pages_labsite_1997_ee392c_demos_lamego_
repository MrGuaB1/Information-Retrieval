huffman table size versus average code word length for dct coding marcelo m lamego abstract the application of huffman code to video codec has several realistic constraint including the maximum memory acess time allowed when coding or decoding images in real time this report provides a comparative analysis between the resulting huffman table sizes and the average code word lengths whether a dct based encoder is applied to different block size image pixels 4 by 4 8 by 8 and 16 by 16 report poscript file project ps
