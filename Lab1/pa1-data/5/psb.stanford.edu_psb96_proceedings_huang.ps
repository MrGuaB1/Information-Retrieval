psb96 rtf writing page 1 chimera an extensible molecular modeling application constructed using standard components conrad c huang gregory s couch eric f pettersen and thomas e ferrin computer graphics laboratory university of california san francisco abstract one of the main goals when creating a new application is to make it available to a large audience two but by no means the only two technological criteria for evaluating the availability of an application are portability and extensibility portability enables the application to be used on many computer systems extensibility allows the application to interoperate with other perhaps existing applications a portable and extensible application is more useful than a standalone one because it will fit into many more computing environments by conforming to user requirements rather than forcing the user into the application mold chimera is a molecular modeling application that addresses the portability and extensibility issues by using standard components whenever possible by using widely available libraries such as x windows motif opengl open inventor and python1 chimera is portable to most popular workstations include those from silicon graphics digital sun and hewlett packard by using the python language interpreter chimera may be extended to interoperate with many other applications an example is the addition with no modification to chimera of an extension for displaying kinemage2 files an additional benefits of using standard components is the availability of standard functionality for example chimera is able to display open inventor files has a programmable command language in python and presents a familiar x motif user interface thus even though chimera is still in an early stage of development it offers a surprising amount of functionality 1 python language home page http www python org 2 protein science kinemages http www prosci uci edu kinemages kinpage html
