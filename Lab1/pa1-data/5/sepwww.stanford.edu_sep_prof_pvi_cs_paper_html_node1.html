convolution and spectra next up print clean next sampled data and z transforms up table of contents convolution and spectra in human events the word convoluted implies complexity in science and engineering convolution refers to a combining equation for signals waves or images although the combination may be complex the convolution equation is an elementary one ideally suited to be presented at the beginning of my long book on dissecting observations intimately connected to convolution are the concepts of pure tones and fourier analysis time and space are ordinarily thought of as continuous but for the purposes of computer analysis we must discretize these axes this is also called sampling or digitizing you might worry that discretization is a practical evil that muddies all later theoretical analysis actually physical concepts have representations that are exact in the world of discrete mathematics in the first part of this book i will review basic concepts of convolution spectra and causality while using and teaching techniques of discrete mathematics by the time we finish with chapter i think you will agree with me that many subtle concepts are easier in the discrete world than in the continuum sampled data and z transforms linear superposition convolution with z transform dissecting systems by factoring convolution equation and program negative time fourier sums superposition of sinusoids sampled time and nyquist frequency fourier sum fourier and z transform unit circle differentiator gaussian examples complex roots inverse z transform correlation and spectra spectra in terms of z transforms two ways to compute a spectrum common signals spectra of complex valued signals time domain conjugate spectral transfer function crosscorrelation matched filtering next up print clean next sampled data and z transforms up table of contents stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
