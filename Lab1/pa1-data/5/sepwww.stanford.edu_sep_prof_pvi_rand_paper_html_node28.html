gaussian mounds next up previous print clean next speed of 2 d gaussian up smoothing in two dimensions previous tent smoothing gaussian mounds in figure 12 we see the result of applying tent smoothing twice mound figure 12 two impulses in two dimensions filtered twice on each axis with a triangle function left bird's eye view right contours of constant altitude z view burn build edit restore notice that the contours instead of being diamonds and rectangles have become much more circular the reason for this is briefly as follows convolution of a rectangle with itself many times approachs the limit of a gaussian function this is a well known result called the central limit theorem it is explained in section it happens that the convolution of a triangle with itself is already a good approximation to the gaussian function z x e x 2 the convolution in y gives z x y e x 2 y 2 e r 2 where r is the radius of the circle when the triangle on the 1 axis differs in width from the triangle on the 2 axis then the circles become ellipses next up previous print clean next speed of 2 d gaussian up smoothing in two dimensions previous tent smoothing stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
