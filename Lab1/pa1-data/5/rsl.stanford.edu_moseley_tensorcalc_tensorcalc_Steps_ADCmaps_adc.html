calculation of measured adc maps the apparent diffusion coefficient adc for a given direction is calculated on a pixel by pixel basis by fitting signal intensities to the stejskal tanner equation using a least squares approach here is shown a non diffusion weighted image b 0 an averaged isotropically diffusion weighted image b 900s mm 2 and the resulting trace image when a number of repeated measurements are done at each b value for example two b 0 measurements and four b 900 measurements there are basically two approaches to take do a least square fit to all 6 points average all measurements at each b value for a given direction and calculated adc based on the averaged values we have decided to use the first approach because it applies equally well to the general case of any number of repetitions at any number of different b values simulations data not published show that the two approaches are basically equivalent see also dti acquisition repetitions go to the next step calculation of tensor elements
