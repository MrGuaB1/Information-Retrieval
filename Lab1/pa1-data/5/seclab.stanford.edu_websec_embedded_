on the security of embedded web interfaces embedded management interfaces emerging massive insecurity in recent years we have seen an accelerating trend of vendors embedding browser based management interfaces in devices ranging from lights out management modules to wifi enabled digital picture frames along with the ease of use these interfaces have brought about significant risks of exposing private data and allowing unauthorized access to computer and network infrastructure in homes and offices we have determined that it is critical to focus the attention of the security community on this emerging problem and define and broadly adopt a standard set of solutions we studied the security of embedded web servers used in consumer electronic devices such as security cameras and photo frames and for it infrastructure such as wireless access points and lights out management systems all the devices we examine turn out to be vulnerable to a variety of web attacks including cross site scripting xss and cross site request forgery csrf in addition we showed that consumer electronics are particularly vulnerable to a nasty form of persistent xss where a non web channel such as nfs or snmp is used to inject a malicious script this script is later used to attack an unsuspecting user who connects to the device's web server we refer to web attacks which are mounted through a non web channel as cross channel scripting xcs we propose a client side defense against certain xcs which we implement as a browser extension pdf xcs cross channel scripting and its impact on web applications hristo bojinov elie bursztein and dan boneh in proceedings of acm ccs 2009 to appear pdf embedded management interfaces emerging massive insecurity hristo bojinov elie bursztein and dan boneh blackhat 2009 technical briefing whitepaper ppt blackhat 2009 slides hristo bojinov elie bursztein and dan boneh presentation at the black hat 2009 more stanford web security research
