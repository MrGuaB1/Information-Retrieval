mkdiff make an n th order differentiator via taylor's series method mkdiff make discrete taylor series approximation to n th derivative function prototype void mkdiff int n float a float h int l int m float d input n order of desired derivative n 0 && n ml is required a fractional distance from integer sampling index see notes h sampling interval l sampling index of first coefficient see notes below m sampling index of last coefficient see notes below output d array m l 1 of coefficients for n th order differentiator notes the abscissae x of a sampled function f x can always be expressed as x j a h where j is an integer a is a fraction and h is the sampling interval to approximate the n th order derivative fn x of the sampled function f x at x j a h use the m l 1 coefficients in the output array d as follows fn x d 0 f jl d 1 f jl 1 d ml f jm ie convolve the coefficients in d with the samples in f m l 1 the number of coefficients must not be greater than the ncmax parameter specified below for best approximations when n is even use a 0.0 l m when n is odd use a 0.5 l m 1 author dave hale colorado school of mines 06 02 89
