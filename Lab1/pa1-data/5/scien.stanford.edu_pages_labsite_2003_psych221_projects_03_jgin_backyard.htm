in attempts to create an anaglyph anaglyph results in attempts to create an anaglyph several pictures were taken in random locations in order to view whether or not depth could be obtained from various images below is a step by step process for creation of an anaglyph 1 two pictures were taken at a horizontal distance of 2.5 apart which is representative of the separation between the eyes the left image will provide what normally the left eye will see while the right image attempts to recreate what the right eye views note it is ideal that the images are taken along the same horizontal plane else the effect will be two offset images that may not coincide when overlapped left eye's image right eye's image 2 all color was removed from the left image besides red while the right image had everything removed besides green this will allow two separate images to be viewed the the images are interlaced 3 overlaying the two images results in the image below after slight leveling adjustment in order to bring out the maximal 3 d effect red green anaglyph photo as can be seen from the photo objects in the foreground appear to stand out as compared to the background anaglyphs may also be completed using red and blue or any two colors as long as the viewing apparatus has filters for the respective colors the following are a few photos we created with the mailbox one containing the most apparent effect another aspect we attempted to view was what would occur if the separation between each shot is larger than a normal eye separation of 2.5 inches as the distance grows we noticed that the images begin to blur and no 3 d effect is rendered this was caused by the fact that the two images were not truly representative of what is viewed by each eye ie too far apart so the brain is not able to piece together the puzzle presented pictures below display the effect of a 2 inch 3 inch and 4 inch separation between shots
