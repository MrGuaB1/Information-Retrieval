wet processes use of triton x100 using triton x 100 triton x 100 can be used as a surfactant to break surface tension on wafers during a boe wet etch the most common use in the lab is aid in the etching of oxide for small features the solution in the small bottle is about 10 1 di triton x 100 only a couple of drops added to the boe 6 1and 20 1 only not 50 1 is needed use of the solution is restricted to the nonmetal metal and general wetbenches once the solution is added to the boe bath a note informing users is required triton x 100 will leave a film on the surface of the wafer which must be removed by the standard resist strip techniques please inform staff when the bottle is getting empty back to top previous page snf home processes page stanford nanofabrication facility last modified 08 29 2003
