entanglement of formation qwiki entanglement of formation from qwiki jump to navigation search the entanglement of formation is an entanglement monotone defined as where the satisfy the condition that this quantity is difficult to compute for mixed states but reduces to the entropy of entanglement for pure states in the special case of a mixed state of two spin 1 2 particles the entanglement of formation can be computed from the two particle concurrence therefore it is generally possible to compute the entanglement of formation between two spins i j removed from an n spin state  the entanglement of formation for such a reduced system is a strong measure of the robustness of that state's entanglement to particle loss explicitly for the two particle state we have where h x xlog 2 x 1 x log 2 1 x and the concurrence is defined here references 1 scott hill and william k wootters entanglement of a pair of quantum bits 1997 2 william k wootters entanglement of formation of an arbitrary state of two qubits 1998 retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php entanglement_of_formation categories concept entanglement monotone quantum information views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 7 september 2005 at 00 10 this page has been accessed 10088 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
