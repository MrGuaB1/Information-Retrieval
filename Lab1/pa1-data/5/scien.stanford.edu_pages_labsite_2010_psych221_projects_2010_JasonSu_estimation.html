color balancing algorithms illuminant estimation jason su illuminant estimation to get where you want to go you have to know where you are introduction illuminant estimation chromatic adaptation gallery introduction this is widely considered the more important of the two steps involved in color balancing because if we can t figure out what illuminant color cast is in the photo then there's no hope that we can do the correct adaptation to get rid of it i explored several techniques and implemented a few of the ones that i thought were interesting and feasible given time constraints gray world simplest color balance robust auto white balance sensor correlation algorithms gray world simplest color balance robust auto white balance sensor correlation references 1 s bianco and r schettini two new von kries based chromatic adaptation transforms found by numerical optimization 2 j huo y chang j wang and x wei robust automatic white balance algorithm using gray color points in images 2006 pp 541 546 3 n limare ipol algorithm simplest color balance http www ipol im pub algo lmps_simplest_color_balance 4 b lindbloom chromatic adaptation http www brucelindbloom com eqn_chromadapt html 5 s susstrunk and gd finlayson evaluating chromatic adaptation transform performance 6 s tominaga a ishida and ba wandell illuminant estimation of natural scene using the sensor correlation method image rochester ny vol 4421 2002 pp 918 921 7 s tominaga s member and ba wandell natural scene illuminant estimation using the sensor correlation psychology vol 90 2002 powerpoint presentation a project by jason su website template by arcsin
