james a spudich lab home page spudich lab we never met a myosin we didn t like home what's new people recent publications links photos contact us about us we are part of stanford's department of biochemistry and we live on the 4th floor of beckman center our general research interest is the structure and function of molecular motors in vitro and in vivo some of our specific research interests include this is beckman graphic designed by tom purcell a former spud lab grad student now with calysta biosystems 1 the molecular basis of energy transduction that leads to atp driven myosin movement on actin 2 the roles of the myosin family of molecular motors in eukaryotic cells 3 the regulation of actin and myosin interaction and their assembly states 4 and regulation of the attachment of molecular motors to their corresponding cargo our approaches include biochemical biophysical and structural studies of actin myosin and associated proteins from eukaryotic cells we have designed and developed in vitro assays for atp dependent movement of purified myosin on filaments reconstituted from purified actin we have taken this assay to the single molecule level using laser traps total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and gold nanoparticle tracking myosin cloning and expression of mutagenized forms that are analyzed for altered functions is routine in our laboratory in vitro motility assay adapted from spink et al 2008 nat struct mol biol 15 591 the cardiovascular system depends critically on the function of the myosin family of molecular motors most notable is the human beta cardiac myosin that drives the beating of the human heart many human hypertrophic cardiomyopathies involve point mutations in beta cardiac myosin and we are now embarking on studies of the effects of these mutations on beta cardiac myosin structure and function to see what the individual members of the lab are doing mouse over the people button at the top of this page click on current spudniks and then click on the name of a current lab member for a look at our latest papers visit our recent publications page enjoy your visit to our site last updated november 25 2011 copyright 2001 2010 for questions about this site please contact shirley sutton at scsutton stanford edu
