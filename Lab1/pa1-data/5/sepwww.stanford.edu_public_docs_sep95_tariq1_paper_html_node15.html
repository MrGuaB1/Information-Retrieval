yet another vti wave equation previous up next print clean next about this document up acoustic anisotropic wave equation previous the perturbation method yet another vti wave equation for 0 the vti acoustic wave equation reduces to the simple elliptically anisotropic wave equation 9 which is second order in t and therefore has only two solutions assuming that is small let us insert when possible the 2 d elliptical wave equation in place of one in each term of the 2 d version of equation 9 the resultant formula after some manipulation is this equation is second order in time and therefore has two solutions to arrive at this form we had to ignore the difference between p and f which is valid since our main objective is to treat the kinematics of wave propagation to understand this equation kinematically we fourier transform equation 39 in x z and t and obtain the following dispersion relation with k z satisfying 41 figure 10 compares k z given by this dispersion relation with that given by equation 4 which is the exact eikonal equation for acoustic vti media the difference is small for which implies that equation 39 can serve as a valid substitute kinematically for equation 11 pxpz2 figure 10 the vertical component of slowness as a function of the horizontal component in a vti medium with and v 2 km s the solid curve corresponds to using approximation 41 while the dashed curve corresponds to the exact acoustic eikonal equation for vti media view previous up next print clean next about this document up acoustic anisotropic wave equation previous the perturbation method stanford exploration project 10 9 1997
