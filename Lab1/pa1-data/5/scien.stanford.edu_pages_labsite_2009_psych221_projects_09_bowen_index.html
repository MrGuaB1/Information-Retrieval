the effect of pixel size and scene luminance on image preference the effect of pixel size and scene luminance on image preference navigation abstract introduction methods results conclusions references source code appendix contacts abstract the increasing demand for smaller form factor higher resolution digital imaging devices has led to the proliferation of cmos imagers with increasingly small pixel sizes consequently devices have traded off light sensitivity for spatial resolution to measure the effect of this trade off in terms of subjective image quality we conducted paired comparisons of images simulated in iset at 4 pixel sizes 1.4 um 1.7 um 2.2 um and 2.8 um and 3 levels of scene luminance 5 cd 10 cd and 15 cd at 2 exposure durations 15 ms and 33.33 ms exploratory data analysis points to a substantial preference for higher scene luminance levels and larger pixel sizes thus higher spatial resolution alone may not be an effective means to improved image quality
