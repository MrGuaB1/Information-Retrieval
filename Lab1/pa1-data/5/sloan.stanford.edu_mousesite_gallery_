mousesite gallery introduction portrait gallery 1 portrait gallery 2 portrait gallery 3 portrait gallery 4 artifacts 1 spaces and work welcome to the photo gallery introduction written documents are the traditional bedrock of historical scholarship but recently historians of modern science and technology have come to appreciate the potential that visual materials offer in adding to our understanding of the daily life of scientific and technological research photographs of daily activities architectural and floor plans even seating arrangements at banquets can provide evidence of informal collaborations lines of communication and influences not recorded in written texts this is particularly valuable information for scholars reconstructing the work of innovative interdisciplinary groups in which unorthodox influences and unlikely collaborations can be especially important and maddeningly difficut to reconstruct at the same time pictures are hard to decode people can be hard to identify settings obscure or contain critical details that escape anyone who wasn t a participant with this in mind we have created a photo gallery featuring roughly 600 photographs taken at the sri augmentation research center in the early 1970s these pictures were donated to the mousesite by douglas engelbart in 1999 our objective in making these available is to stimulate memories and encourage feedback from participants and to provide visual documentation of the arc's work and environment for future scholars ultimately we hope that the gallery will contain both images and the information necessary to interpret them organization the gallery is accessed via several pages of thumbnails each thumbnail is hyperlinked to a page containing a larger version of that picture and other pages of the same person a few other pictures show groups of people or events as we acquire information about the pictures dates and contents we will add them to the the pages a collection of images of artifacts mice key chord sets workstations can also be viewed finally there are images of spaces meetings and people using the nls feedback several photographs are featured in the forum the mousesite's arena for discussing documents artifacts and events related to the arc and its work there visitors can help us identify people places technologies and events in pictures if you recognize or are a person in a picture we invite you to contribute we re particularly interested in gathering material about who people in featured pictures were knowing what work they did in the arc both their official job descriptions and real work which are sometimes quite different and learning more about their subsequent careers if you have information that you would like to share about pictures not in the forum please feel free to e mail us please make sure to include the url of the page you are commenting on
