articles of confederation and united states constitution articles of confederation why were the articles of confederation so weak what we didn t like about the british taxation without representation large central government monarchy had all the power states always had to listen to the king all power was in the king's hands king could change the rules laws any time so the articles of confederation federal government could not tax states didn t have to follow laws and treaties states had their own laws and didn t have to follow any other states laws no executive branch or national court system any amendment required all 13 states what's the problem federal government could not tax very difficult to raise money states didn t have to follow laws and treaties each state had its own laws no executive branch or national court system any amendment required all 13 states so very difficult to modify
