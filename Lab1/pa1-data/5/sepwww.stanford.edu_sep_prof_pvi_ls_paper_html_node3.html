inverse filter example next up previous print clean next normal equations up multivariate least squares previous multivariate least squares inverse filter example let us take up a simple example of time series analysis given the input say to some filter say then the output is necessarily to design an inverse filter we would wish to have boldc come out as close as possible to 1 0 0 so the statement of wishes 17 is 19 the method of solution is to premultiply by the matrix getting 20 thus 21 and the inverse filter comes out to be 22 inserting this value of f 0 f 1 back into 19 yields the actual output which is not a bad approximation to 1 0 0 next up previous print clean next normal equations up multivariate least squares previous multivariate least squares stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
