description of bilinear interpolation edge sensing interpolation algorithm i from our description of non adaptive algorithms it can be seen that most of the color interpolation is done by averaging neighboring pixels indiscriminately this causes an artifact the zipper effect in the interpolated image to combat with this artifact it is natural to derive an algorithm that can detect local spatial features present in the pixel neighborhood and then makes effective choices as to which predictor to use that neighborhood the result is a reduction or elimination of zipper type artifacts and algorithms that involve this kind of intelligent detection and decision process are referred as adaptive color interpolation algorithms human visual systems are sensitive to edges present in the images and non adaptive color interpolation algorithms often fail around edges since they are not able to detect edges to deal with edges let's first look at an edge sensing algorithm 14 3 15 for convenience figure 1 is duplicated here interpolation of green pixels first define two gradients one in horizontal direction the other in vertical direction for each blue red position for instance consider b8 define two gradients as where denotes absolute value define some threshold value t the algorithm then can be described as follows the choice of t depends on the images and can have defferent optimum values from different neighborhoods a particular choice of t is 4 in this case the algorithm becomes interpolation of red blue pixels same as in smooth hue transition interpolation in logarithmic exposure space other methods may be used as well
