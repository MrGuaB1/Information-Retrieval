method of irani and peleg irani and peleg iterative method this method is concerned with solving the following equation where sensed image of he kth frame f high resolution image in a desired reconstruction view finding f is the objective of the super resolution algortihm the 2d transformation from f to as determined by affine transformation assumed to be invertible h a blurring operator determined by the gaussian psf an additive noise term downsampling operator to go from sr dimensions to lr dimensions the main feature of the irani and peleg method is that it iteratively uses the current best guess for the sr image to create lr images and then compare the simulated lr images to the original lr images these difference images found by subtracting real lr simulated lr are then used to improve the initial guess by backprojecting each value in the difference image onto the sr image this results in an improved sr image we now introduce as the nth iteration of the simulated version of the kth frame as the inital guess for the sr image as the nth iterative guess for the sr image k as the number of lr images p as a backprojection kernel determined by the equation where is the unity pulse centered at 0 0 the iterative method is to then use the following equations for the most ideal resolution on f we can additionally define an error function which we wish to minimize
