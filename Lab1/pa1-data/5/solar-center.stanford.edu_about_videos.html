solar videos stanford solar center about the sun for students for educators space weather monitors ancient observatories solar folklore solar art & literature watch the sun move the sun oscillating the solar photosphere moves in and out throbbing with large and small scale rhythmic motions much like fudge boiling in a pot the sun's oscillations are far too tiny to be seen with the naked eye but sensitive instruments on the soho spacecraft can detect the movements and translate them into something we can see when you watch the following videos look for both large and small patterns in the movements solar oscillations 5 hours of medium l data from sept 1 1996 a smaller scale version of the above solar oscillations 10 hours of medium l data sept 1 1996 sun grazing comets and coronal mass ejections the lasco instrument on the soho spacecraft is able to image the entire sun and its local surroundings lasco and its scientists have captured some impressive events including comets diving in and possibly meeting their fate in the solar furnace as well as great eruptions of material coronal mass ejections from the limb of the sun the video shows the sun between december 22 and december 27 1996 featuring a sun grazing comet a coronal mass ejection and the sun moving in front of the galactic center the lasco instrument covers up the sun with a disk to avoid its glare hence generating an artificial eclipse you can see the disk in the video scientists are also able to subtract the glare from the sun so you can actually see stars in the background watch the movie carefully and you will notice the sun moving in front of the constellation sagittarius which includes the great cloud of stars toward the center of our milky way look for sagittarius in the bottom half of the image near the beginning of the clip a tiny comet will appear about half way to the lower left of the screen grow a short tail and arc into or behind we don t know which the sun on the right side of the image watch for the coronal mass ejection a huge blob of material being blasted off the sun this one wasn t headed for the earth though how can you tell the many tiny streaks in the video are cosmic rays striking and being recorded by the instrument a sun grazing comet and coronal mass ejection cme there is also a close up and compressed in time view of the comet and cme in the previous video 477k this time the comet is bold and dramatic soho has discovered many comets 10 at last count the comet you see here has been named soho 6 compressed view of comet and cme home request solar posters site map glossary about us contact us 2008 by stanford solar center permitted uses credits
