unwarping of eddy current distortions eddy currents caused by the diffusion weighting gradients will lead to geometric distortions in the diffusion weighted images because the eddy currents vary with both gradient direction and gradient amplitude and thus b value the distortions will vary from one diffusion direction to the next eddy current effects are also highly scanner dependent the distortions can be one or all of shear magnification pixel shift click on the image below to show a movie of a number of diffusion weighted images acquired along different directions displaying varying distortion b 900s mm 2 next to the movie is a mean image of all the diffusion weighted images used in the movie the blurring caused by misalignment is obvious the diffusion weighted images are unwarped using the method described in de crespigny aj and moseley me eddy current induced image warping in diffusion weighted epi proc ismrm 6th meeting sydney 661 1998 and haselgrove jc and moore jr correction for distortion of echo planar images used to calculate the apparent diffusion coefficient mrm 1996 36 960 964 medline citation as reference for the unwarping is used the mean image shown above despite the significant blurring in this image it functions surprisingly well as a reference for the unwarping procedure the unwarping is however repeated again using a newly constructed mean image of all once unwarped images as a reference after unwarping twice the images are much better aligned this is easily appreciated in the movie and mean image shown below although the image contrast still varies as expected the edge of the brain remains still the blurring of the mean image is significantly reduced and white matter gray matter is easily delineated go to the next step calculation of measured adc maps
