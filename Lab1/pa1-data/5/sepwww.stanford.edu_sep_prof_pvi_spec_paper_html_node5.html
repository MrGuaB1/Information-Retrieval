the analytic signal next up previous print clean next instantaneous envelope up hilbert transform previous the quadrature filter the analytic signal the so called analytic signal can be constructed from a real valued time series u t and itself phase shifted ie v t can be found using equation 5 the analytic signal is g t where 11 in the time domain the filter 1 iq z is where is an impulse function at time t 0 the filter vanishes for negative thus it is a real step function in the frequency domain the values all vanish at negative frequency we can guess where the name analytic signal came from if we think back to z transforms and causal functions causal functions are free of poles inside the unit circle so they are analytic there their causality is the fourier dual to the one sidedness we see here in the frequency domain a function is analytic if it is one sided in the dual fourier domain next up previous print clean next instantaneous envelope up hilbert transform previous the quadrature filter stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
