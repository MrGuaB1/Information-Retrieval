safety hazard classes at wet benches snf primary handling hazard classes for wet benches at snf we define the primary hazards for each of the liquid chemicals or chemical mixtures that is handled at the wet benches although virtually all the chemicals at snf pose a health risk due to inhalation according to standard laboratory practice all direct chemicals handling must take place in properly exhausted areas so the primary hazards are the concerns other than inhalation which is a given that the wet bench user must be aware of when handling these chemicals handling risks include contact with skin mixing with other chemicals contact with combustibles like cleanroom wipes etc in general things that should be avoided at all costs but may happen when for example a beaker is tipped over the primary hazards as described here should noted on the in use hazardous materials blue card which is required for any container other than designated hot pots or tanks the hazard classes are as follows 1 corrosive 2 flammable 3 oxidizer 4 air water reactive 5 toxic 6 non hazardous 1 corrosive is used to describe acids and bases direct contact with skins will usually results in burns never mix with flammables 2 flammable generally covers most all solvents these should never be mixed with corrosives or oxidizers 3 oxidizer generally covers chemicals which have oxygen as an elemental component thus they sustain fires by providing a nice ready supply of oxygen never mix with flammables 4 air water reactive generally means that heat is generated when this chemical is mixed with air and or water corrosive oxidizing acids are included in this hazard class 5 toxic indicates that even low levels of direct exposure pose a health risk 6 non hazardous is generally used to refer only to water back to top home sitemap search stanford nanofabrication facility webmaestro snf stanford edu last modified 08 29 2003
