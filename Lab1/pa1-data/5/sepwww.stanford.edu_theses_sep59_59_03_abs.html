phase shift migration of passive seismic data by steve cole phase shift migration of passive seismic data by steve cole can passive seismic data be used to image subsurface structure from a processing standpoint it seems possible there is only one difference between passive data and conventional reflection seismic data that will require modification of existing wave equation based imaging methods that difference is that in a passive survey structures may be illuminated by a variety of ambient noise sources over time rather than a single source whose position and excitation time are known there is no time zero at which our reflectors explode this constraint is not difficult to accommodate in phase shift migration for example the downward continuation step is unaffected it is only the imaging step that requires changes i bypass the imaging step of phase shift migration and obtain a picture of subsurface scatterer strength as a function of time intergrating the power in this image over time gives an image of the subsurface in tests this technique gives a consistent result when applied to passive data recorded during different time intervals while these results are preliminary their sucess suggests that imaging with passive data is a viable technique back to sep 59 index page download pdf 2592 kb ps gz 3316 kb stanford exploration project
