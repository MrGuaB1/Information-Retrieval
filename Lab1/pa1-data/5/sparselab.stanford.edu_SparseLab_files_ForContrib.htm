sparselab for contributors instructions for contributors sparselab is an amalgamation of work from several authors and we welcome contributions if you believe your work would be a good fit with sparselab email us at sparselab at stanford edu with only one sign guidelines for submitted code packages each article gets one subdirectory of sparselab100 papers each subdirectory contains a the paper itself b a subdirectory housing a demo the files in a subdirectory have stylized names so that the name indicates the function of the file stylized names are based on a name and a short prefix the name should be short but descriptive for example extcsdemo for scripts associated with the paper extensions of compressed sensing and the prefix should be a related tag for example extcs the subdirectory name reflects the name you have chosen for example sparselab100 papers extcsdemo guidelines for script submissions for demos one script creates one complete figure not a series of figures and not just a subplot of a figure if several scripts need to work with the same variables for example if you want a variable to be created in one script and then used in later scripts these variables should be made global no pause's print's or figure calls in a script as far as possible try to use the tools in the sparselab utilities directory to perform actions like setting axes inspection of existing scripts will help in following these rules the idea is that these scripts and those of future contributors to sparselab should be upwardly compatible with script running engines making more sophisticated use of the matlab user interface documenting individual figures each m file for an individual figure contains a help header which is displayed in the command window at the time the figure is generated in the plot window this provides a kind of on line narrative or caption here is an example from extcsdemo genfig1 extcsdemo figure 1 error of reconstruction versus number of samples for signals with a controlled number of nonzeros data files used datal0_20 mat datal0_50 mat datal0_100 mat see also gendatal0 m supported in part by nsf dms 05 05303 last updated 12 08 2006 by vcs
