ee 361 psych 221 psych 221 final project audio optical illusions patrick schindler introduction methods results conclusions references appendix i conclusions i think one of the biggest take home ideas here is that audio optical illusions are tricky to master if a student in a future class wanted to try and pick up where i left off i would recommend getting a very early start and focusing in on just 2 or 3 illusions that are known to work it is possible to create new illusions but it is very difficult to perfect the timing and nuances one argument for trying something new is that in the past people did not have access to powerful computes at home so most of the common examples are those that could either be developed without a computer or developed in an academic environment now that personal computing has become much more powerful i believe that we are going to be seeing many new illusions that were previously too difficult to master i dont want to conclude too much from the results that i got given the size of the sample and the limited amount of control i can conclude that the bounce illusion is very powerful and works well if one were to try to come to some very scientific conclusions that would be the experiment to start with
