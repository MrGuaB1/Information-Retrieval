pacific symposium on biocomputing 2012 this is the post event website for psb 2012 information on the upcoming psb is now available the psb 2012 conference materials and electronic proceedings are available please see below for more information pacific symposium on biocomputing 2012 the pacific symposium on biocomputing psb 2012 was an international multidisciplinary conference for the presentation and discussion of current research in the theory and application of computational methods in problems of biological significance papers and presentations were rigorously peer reviewed and were published in an archival proceedings volume psb 2012 was held january 3 7 2012 at the fairmont orchid big island of hawaii psb 2012 brought together top researchers from the us the asian pacific nations and around the world to exchange research results and address open issues in all aspects of computational biology psb is a forum for the presentation of work in databases algorithms interfaces visualization modeling and other computational methods as applied to biological problems with emphasis on applications in data rich areas of molecular biology the psb has been designed to be responsive to the need for critical mass in sub disciplines within biocomputing for that reason it is the only meeting whose sessions are defined dynamically each year in response to specific proposals psb sessions are organized by leaders in the emerging areas and targeted to provide a forum for publication and discussion of research in biocomputing's hot topics in this way psb provides an early forum for serious examination of emerging methods and approaches in this rapidly changing field psb 2012 sessions identification of aberrant pathway and network activity from high throughput data intrinsically disordered proteins analysis prediction simulation and biology microbiome studies analytical tools and techniques modeling host pathogen interactions computational biology and bioinformatics for infectious disease research personalized medicine from genotypes and molecular phenotypes towards computed therapy text and knowledge mining for pharmacogenomics genotype phenotype drug relationships session survey tutorials were offered on january 3 2012 psb 2012 workshops psb offered three three hour workshops on january 3 the workshops were created to provide an opportunity for a gathering that will not be based on peer reviewed papers included in the proceedings book the workshops consisted of presentations by invited speakers abstract submissions for the workshops were evaluated by the workshop co chairs peer reviewed papers the core of the conference consists of rigorously peer reviewed full length papers reporting on original work keynote speakers elaine mardis professor of genetics and molecular microbiology and co director of the genome institute at the washington university school of medicine gave a talk entitled analytical challenges in next and third generation sequencing data james heywood co founder and chairman patientslikeme gave a talk entitled justice consent and free will in a transparent medical age sponsors psb gratefully acknowledges the support of its sponsors we would like to offer a special thanks to the national library of medicine national institutes of health for their participation since the founding of the conference and for their commitment to travel support for psb 1999 psb 2000 psb 2001 psb 2002 psb 2003 psb 2004 psb 2005 psb 2006 psb 2007 psb 2008 psb 2009 psb 2010 psb 2011 and psb 2012 psb is affiliated with the international society for computational biology please visit our sponsors websites and let them know you appreciate their support of psb national library of medicine international society for computational biology if you or your organization would like to be a sponsor of psb please email the psb coordinator at psb hawaii gmail com previous psb meetings information about previous psb meetings including the full electronic proceedings is available the 2011 psb meeting the 2010 psb meeting the 2009 psb meeting the 2008 psb meeting the 2007 psb meeting the 2006 psb meeting the 2005 psb meeting the 2004 psb meeting the 2003 psb meeting the 2002 psb meeting the 2001 psb meeting the 2000 psb meeting the 1999 psb meeting the 1998 psb meeting the 1997 psb meeting the 1996 psb meeting for more information tiffany murray psb coordinator department of bioengineering 318 campust drive s170 stanford ca usa 94305 5444 telephone 650 725 0659 fax 650 723 8544 email psb hawaii gmail com this page is no longer being updated last update january 19 2012
