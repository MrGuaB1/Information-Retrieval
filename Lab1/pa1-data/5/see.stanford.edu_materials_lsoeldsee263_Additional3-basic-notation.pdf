basic notation page 1 ee263 prof s boyd basic notation basic set notation a1 ar the set with elements a1 ar a s a is in the set s s t the sets s and t are equal ie every element of s is in t and every element of t is in s s t the set s is a subset of the set t ie every element of s is also an element of t a sp a there exists an a in s for which the property p holds x sp a property p holds for every element in s a s p a the set of all a in s for which p holds the set s is sometimes omitted if it can be determined from context a b union of sets a b x x a or x b a b intersection of sets a b x x a and x b a b cartesian product of two sets a b a b a a b b some specific sets r the set of real numbers rn the set of real n vectors n 1 matrices r1 n the set of real n row vectors 1 n matrices rm n the set of real m n matrices j can mean 1 in the company of electrical engineers i can mean 1 for normal people i is the polite term in mixed company ie when non electrical engineers are present c cn cm n the set of complex numbers complex n vectors complex m n matrices z the set of integers z 1 0 1 r+ the nonnegative real numbers ie r+ x r x 0 a b a b a b a b the real intervals x a x b x a x b x a x b and x a x b respectively 1 page 2 vectors and matrices we use square brackets and to construct matrices and vectors with white space delineating the entries in a row and a new line indicating a new row for example 1 2 is a row vector in r1 2 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 is matrix in r2 3 1 2 t denotes a column vector ie an element of r2 1 which we abbreviate as r2 we use curved brackets and surrounding lists of entries delineated by commas as an alternative method to construct column vectors thus we have three ways to denote a column vector 1 2 1 2 t 1 2 note that in our notation scheme which is fairly standard 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 aren t used functions the notation f a b means that f is a function on the set a into the set b the notation b f a means b is the value of the function f at the point a where a a and b b the set a is called the domain of the function f it can thought of as the set of legal parameter values that can be passed to the function f the set b is called the codomain or sometimes range of the function f it can thought of as a set that contains all possible returned values of the function f there are several ways to think of a function the formal definition is that f is a subset of a b with the property that for every a a there is exactly one b b such that a b f we denote this as b f a perhaps a better way to think of a function is as a black box or software function or subroutine the domain is the set of all legal values or data types or structures that can be passed to f the codomain of f gives the data type or data structure of the values returned by f thus f a is meaningless if a a if a a then b f a is an element of b also note that the function is denoted f it is wrong to say the function f a since f a is an element of b not a function having said that we do sometimes use sloppy notation such as the function f t t3 to say this more clearly you could say the function f r r defined by f t t3 for t r 2 page 3 examples 0.1 r 2 r+ 1 2j c with j 1 the matrix a 0.3 6.1 0.12 7.2 0 0.01 is an element in r2 3 we can define a function f r3 r2 as f x ax for any x r3 if x r3 then f x is a particular vector in r2 we can say the function f is linear to say the function f x is linear is technically wrong since f x is a vector not a function similarly we can t say a is linear it is just a matrix we can define a function f a r a 0 rn rn by f a x 1 a x for any a r a 0 and any x rn the function f could be informally described as division of a vector by a nonzero scalar consider the set a 0 1 3.2 the elements of a are 0 1 and 3.2 therefore for example 1 a and 0 3.2 a also we can say that x a 1 x 4 or x a x 3 suppose a 1 1 another representation for a is a x r x2 1 suppose a 1 2 0 and b 3 2 then a b 1 2 0 3 a b 2 suppose a 1 2 0 and b 1 3 then a b 1 1 1 3 2 1 2 3 0 1 0 3 f r r with f x x2 x defines a function from r to r while u r+ r2 with u t t cost 2e t defines a function from r+ to r2 3
