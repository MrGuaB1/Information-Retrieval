how to measure a beam waist qwiki how to measure a beam waist from qwiki jump to navigation search it is often necessary to measure the waist of a gaussian beam in lab the simplest technique is the razor blade method a straight razor blade is drawn across the beam and the intensity recorded at several points for an input power p and a beam with waist w this is used to find the beam measurements that are then used to calculate the beam parameters derivation we begin with the intensity equation for a gaussian beam the power blocked by the razor simply the double integral the two integrals can be performed separately if the beam is elliptical and the razor is drawn along either the major or minor axis perfectly sensible results for the beam parameters along that axis will be given the y integral is a simple gaussian and the x integral is an error function resulting in which was used to calculate the values above retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php how_to_measure_a_beam_waist category how to views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 31 august 2006 at 14 28 this page has been accessed 12452 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
