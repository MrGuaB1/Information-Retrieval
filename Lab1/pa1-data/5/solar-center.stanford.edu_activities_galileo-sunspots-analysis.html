are sunspots really on the sun stanford solar center about the sun for students for educators space weather monitors ancient observatories solar folklore solar art & literature are those sunspots really on the sun data analysis first you re going to transfer your sunspot data onto the table for your sunspot speed graph note that you will need to figure out the distance in centimeters traveled by the sunspot groups each day you will then make a graph with the group's longitude on the horizontal axis and its apparent speed in centimeters per day on the vertical axis as an optional assignment you can also record the group's speed in degrees of longitude per day and plot it on a separate graph pick your best sunspot group the one for which you have the most data what you want to find is how far that group appeared to travel across the sun's disk remember to measure to the center of the spot or spot group to figure out how far the sunspot group moved from the first to second day subtract your measured distance the one you measured on your sketch from the edge of the sun of the first day from the measured distance of the second day eg if your day 1 3 cm and day 2 4.5 cm the distance would be 4.5 3 1.5 cm now graph that point above the longitude measurement for the second day figure out how far the group moved between each of the rest of your days and place the points on the graph if you have a day missing figure the distance the spot group moved in 2 days and use half that amount for each of the 2 days once your data is plotted draw a line curve between the points to minimize recording errors graph one or two more sunspot groups just as you did the first home request solar posters site map glossary about us contact us 2008 by stanford solar center permitted uses credits
