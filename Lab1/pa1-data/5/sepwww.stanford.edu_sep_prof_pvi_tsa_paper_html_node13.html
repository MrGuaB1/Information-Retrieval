proof that pe filter output is white next up previous print clean next nonwhiteness of gapped pe filter up the error filter family previous prediction error filter output is proof that pe filter output is white the basic idea of least squares fitting is that the residual is orthogonal to the fitting functions applied to the pe filter this idea means that the output of a pe filter is orthogonal to lagged inputs the orthogonality applies only for lags in the past because prediction knows only the past while it aims to the future what we want to show is different namely that the output is uncorrelated with itself as opposed to the input for lags in both directions hence the output spectrum is white we are given a signal y t and filter it by 11 we found by setting to zero 12 we interpret this to mean that the residual is orthogonal to the fitting function or the present pe filter output is orthogonal to its past inputs or one side of the crosscorrelation vanishes taking an unlimited number of time lags and filter coefficients the crosscorrelation vanishes not only for but for larger values say where and s 0 in other words the future pe filter outputs are orthogonal to present and past inputs 13 recall that if and then for any a 1 and a 2 so for any we have 14 and for any linear combination we have 15 therefore substituting from 11 we get 16 which is an autocorrelation function and must be symmetric thus 17 since the autocorrelation of the prediction error output is an impulse its spectrum is white this has many interesting philosophical implications as we will see next next up previous print clean next nonwhiteness of gapped pe filter up the error filter family previous prediction error filter output is stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
