synaptome brain complexity challenges within the mere 1.5 liter volume of the human brain thousands of kilometers of axons and dendrites interconnect hundreds of billions of highly diverse neurons and glial cells at hundreds of trillions of synapses each individual synapse is itself a complex molecular machine comprising tens of thousands of diverse protein molecules most of which are active as individual molecular switches and dynamically transduce a wide variety of cellular electrical and biochemical signals moreover synaptic proteins can be expressed from many alternative genes and exist in different neurons in multiple protein isoforms so it is certain that a high degree of combinatorial proteomic diversity must distinguish large numbers of synaptic subpopulations within every region of the central nervous system thus the almost unthinkably vast complexity associated with both the intricacy of the brain's synaptic interconnection patterns and the diversity of the component neurons and synapses is the most formidable challenge facing efforts to understand the physical basis of brain memory and mind while direct experimental reconstruction of brain synaptic circuitry has seemed beyond practicality through most of the history of neuroscience twenty first century advances in computation and molecular genetics are finally permitting the advance of such efforts connectome this term is being applied today to the nascent body of knowledge that will grapple and attempt to manage the complexities of the brains patterns of synaptic connectivity progress here is resulting from new computational and genetic imaging methods that span magnetic resonance optical and electron microscopic imaging modalities to reveal interconnection patterns across the wide range of brain architecture spatial scales synaptome this term designates the nascent body of knowledge regarding the molecular and functional diversity of the myriad individual synapses progress here is resulting from the application of transgenic methods in experimental animals and from the introduction of new high resolution proteomic imaging methods such as array tomography
