colored noise next up previous print clean next noise as strong as up solution by weighting functions previous estimating the noise variance colored noise i made the noise in figure 2 and 3 from random numbers that i filtered spatially to give a lateral coherence on a scale something like the size of a letter which is somewhat larger than a line which makes up the letter width the noise looks like paper mottling the spectral color spatial coherence of the noise does not affect the results much if at all in other words independent random numbers of the same amplitude yield results that are about the same i chose this particular noise color to maximize the chance that noise can be recognized on a poor reproduction we can see on figure 2 that the noise amplitude is roughly one third of the signal amplitude this data thus has a significant amount of noise but since the signal is bigger than the noise we should really call this good data next we will make the noise bigger than the signal and see that we can still solve the problem we will need more powerful techniques however next up previous print clean next noise as strong as up solution by weighting functions previous estimating the noise variance stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
