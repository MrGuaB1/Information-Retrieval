introduction to robotics cs223a homework 2 winter 2007 2008 page 1 introduction to robotics cs223a homework 2 winter 2007 2008 due wednesday january 30 1 the following sketch represents a generic open serial kinematic chain here each kinematic joint connects two adjacent members assume that the relative displacement between adjacent members i 1 and i is described by an operator ti that is a 4x4 matrix whose elements are computed in a coordinate frame a fixed to the base of the chain now if each member is displaced in sequence starting from the free end the displacement operator for the resultant total displacement of the free end will be given by t1t2t3t4 note in this problem you are to use only displacements operators not coordinate transformations however if the displacements are done in the reverse order ie starting at the fixed end and moving in the sequence 1 2 3 4 then the operators t2 t3 and t4 no longer represent the actual displacements determine in terms of the original ti a the operator for joint 2 when its displacement is done after the displacement in joint 1 let us call this operator t 2 b the operator for joint 3 when its displacement follows the displacement in joints 1 and 2 from part a let us call this operator t 3 c the operator for joint 4 when its displacement follows the displacement in joints 1 2 and 3 from part b let us call this operator t 4 d using your results for parts a b and c show that the resulting displacement operator for the free end is still t1t2t3t4 2 consider the following rrp manipulator figure courtesy of jj craig page 2 a draw a schematic of this manipulator with the axes of frames 0 through 3 labeled also include the parameters 1 2 a2 and d3 on your schematic assume that in this diagram the slider bar is parallel to the ground and that this is the configuration where 1 0 2 90o b write down the denavit hartenberg parameters for this manipulator in the form of a table ia i 1 i 1 di i 1 2 3 c derive the forward kinematics for this manipulator that is find 0 3t 3 consider the following 2rp2r manipulator figure courtesy of jj craig a draw a schematic of this manipulator with the axes of frames 0 through 5 labeled include all non zero denavit hartenberg parameters and the joint variables draw your schematic in the position where as far as possible the angles i are in their zero positions b write down the denavit hartenberg parameters for this manipulator in the form of a table ia i 1 i 1 di i 1 2 3 4 5
