lesson plan stanford solar center about the sun for students for educators space weather monitors ancient observatories solar folklore solar art & literature build your own spectroscope summary of activity students build a working spectroscope to study the nature of light the curriculum includes study guides for various grade groups powerpoints to explain concepts age appropriate hands on activities and 3 videos class sets of spectroscopes and gratings are available to accompany the lessons diffraction gratings recall if you have previously ordered spectrograph sets during 2011 please check our information about a diffraction grating recall gratings shipped after 1 november 2011 should be fine curriculum resources associated with this activity study guide for grades 2 4 uses gratings only does not require spectroscopes study guide for grades 5 8 requires spectroscopes colors of the sun video grades 5 8 explains the use of spectroscopy fingerprints in sunlight presentation and activities grades 9 12 a powerpoint presentation demonstrations and activities to be used to introduce spectroscopy to high school students to accompany spectroscopes fingerprints in starlight presentation and activities grades 9 12 a powerpoint presentation demonstrations and activities to be used to introduce spectroscopy into an ap chemistry class to accompany spectroscopes colors and motions of the sun video grades 9 12 explains the concepts of spectroscopy and helioseismology as related to the sun produced by jay pasachoff supplement to colors and motions of the sun about sdo grades 9 12 details nasa's solar dynamics observatory spacecraft produced by jay pasachoff powerpoint presentation on the sun stands alone without spectroscopes nasa product review of spectroscopy educational materials cover letter for productreview and explanation duration of activity 60 minutes to build the spectroscope 1 class period for each of the activities chosen student prerequisites have some prior exposure to the nature and topic of light have sufficient small motor skills to handle cutting and taping materials 1 poster and grating for each student available from the stanford solar center student work sheets from study guide the movie colors of the sun produced by stanford solar center optional access to various light sources such as incandescent and flourescent bulbs the study guide see below gives additional materials needed for the various activities teacher preparation initially build one of the spectrographs to learn how to construct and use it view completed spectrograph study guide and work sheets all about the sun study guide grades 5 8 pdf all about the sun study guide grades 2 4 pdf objectives students will build and learn how to use their own working spectroscope observe how white light can be refracted to form a color spectrum that gives distinctive information about its source learn what spectroscopic data can specifically tell astronomers about the sun planets stars and other objects far away observe that the visible spectrum is only a part of what our sun a star emits within the electromagnetic spectrum determine that the distance of an object from an observer affects the apparent size of the object understand how technological design can help scientists to better understand our earth our sun our solar system and the universe around us grade level grades 2 4 5 12 relationship to national standards national standards addressed grades 2 4 national standards addressed grades 5 8 procedure the study guide details steps for each activity the activities are sizing up the stars students observe that two objects of equal size can appear to be different sizes when placed at a greater or lesser distance from the observer grades 2 8 a rainbow connection students observe how white light can be refracted to form a visible color sectrum that has a pattern grades 2 4 from a distance students utilize their abilities for technological design to perform science inquiry by proposing methods for obtaining information about a faraway object with being able to handle or get close to is grades 5 8 wavelength and energy a graphic demonstration of the relationship between energy and wavelength designed to initiate a discussion about the electromagnetic spectrum grades 5 8 resonance rings introduces students to the concept of resonance and the absorption of energy by atoms or molecules when electromagnetic radiation enters the earth's atmosphere grades 5 8 spectroscopic observations students construct their own spectroscope observe common light sources record their spectra and compare their findings with fellow classroom scientisits grades 5 14 assessment assessment information is included in the study guide glossary a glossary is included in the study guide bibliography let us know how did this lesson work in your classroom home request solar posters site map glossary about us contact us 2008 by stanford solar center permitted uses credits
