gender classification preprocessing preprocessing introduction database preprocessing algorithms results and conclusions references appendix to reduce the dimensionality of the face images the first eight klt 4 coefficients of all test and training images were calculated the klt was used because it has the important property that the projection of the data set on the first n principle components has the highest energy concentration of any other n component projection therefore it captures the highest amount of variation in a data set more than any other linear transform for a fixed number of components to compute the klt coefficients of the test and training images the first eight eigenfaces were calculated using only the training faces the eight eigenfaces are shown in figure 1 the sirovich and kirby method was used to compute the eigenfaces once the eigenfaces were calculated we projected the test and training faces onto the eigenfaces this projection produced eight coefficients for all the test and training faces that when multiplied by their respective eigenface and summed approximated the original test and training faces the eight coefficients for both the test and training images were used as inputs to all the classification algorithms see results and conclusions section for a discussion on why eight coefficients were chosen figure 1 first eight eigenfaces calculated for a training set first eigenface is the top left image the second is to its right the eighth eigenface is the bottom right image introduction database preprocessing algorithms results and conclusions references appendix
