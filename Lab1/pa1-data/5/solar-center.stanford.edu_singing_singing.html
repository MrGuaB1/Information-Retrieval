the singing sun stanford solar center about the sun for students for educators space weather monitors ancient observatories solar folklore solar art & literature the singing sun the sun is playing a secret melody hidden inside itself that produces a widespread throbbing motion of its surface the sounds are coursing through the sun's interior causing the entire globe or parts of it to move in and out slowly and rhythmically like the regular rise and fall of tides in a bay or of a beating heart kenneth r lang hear the sun sing watch the sun boil helioseismology other pages classroom activity solar music hear the sun sing have you ever wondered what the sun would sound like if you could hear it our sun lies 93000000 miles away surrounded by the vacuum of space sound won t travel through space of course but with the right instrument scientists can hear pulsations from the sun the entire sun vibrates from a complex pattern of acoustical waves much like a bell if your eyes were sharp enough you could see a bell's surface jiggle in complex patterns as the waves bounced around within it likewise astronomers at stanford university can record acoustical pressure waves in the sun by carefully tracking movements on the sun's surface to do this they use an instrument called a michelson doppler imager mdi mounted on the soho spacecraft circling the sun 1000000 miles from earth the sun's acoustical waves bounce from one side of the sun to the other in about two hours causing the sun's surface to oscillate or wiggle up and down because these sound waves travel underneath the sun's surface they are influenced by conditions inside the sun so scientists can use the oscillations to learn more about how the structure of the sun's interior shapes its surface the sun's sound waves are normally at frequencies too low for the human ear to hear to be able to hear them the scientists sped up the waves 42000 times and compressed 40 days of vibrations into a few seconds what you ll be hearing are just a few dozen of the 10 million resonances echoing inside the sun listen to the sun's song aiff and au formats a collection of solar sounds aiff and wave formats watch the sun boil the sun vibrates up and down in and out much like a pot of fudge boiling on the stove when you make fudge you can see large bubbles of chocolate covering the pan and in each of those big bubbles you can also see a set of tiny bubbles growing and popping with gusto the sun is the same when you look at the following movies you are viewing the large scale big bubble oscillations the small ones would be too tiny to see it is these oscillations which generate the sound waves you heard solar oscillations 5 hours of medium l data from sept 1 1996 mpeg format 4 meg a smaller scale version of the above mpeg format 2 meg solar oscillations 10 h ours of medium l data sept 1 1996 mpeg format 8 meg now you can go and make some fudge learning about the sun through sound waves helioseismology scientists can learn much about the sun's complex interior by tracking and deciphering it's sound waves but since we can t hear the sun directly scientists have to watch for the effects of those sounds waves the sun's oscillations to be able to decipher the sounds so like seismologists who study earthquakes helioseismologists study quakes on the sun their job is a bit like figuring out how a piano was put together by listening to it fall down the stairs would you like to learn more about helioseismology helioseismology introduction soi stanford helio and asteroseismology aarhus university helioseismology bibliography soi stanford if you like to play with slinky r toys there is a wonderful hands on activity to demonstrate the nature of sound waves teachers you can easily do this in your classroom solar music home request solar posters site map glossary about us contact us 2008 by stanford solar center permitted uses credits
