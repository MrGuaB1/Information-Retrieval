suconv convolution with user supplied filter suconv stdin stdout filter optional parameters required parameters one of sufile file containing su trace to use as filter filter user supplied convolution filter ascii optional parameters none trace header fields accessed ns trace header fields modified ns notes it is quietly assumed that the time sampling interval on the single trace and the output traces is the same as that on the traces in the input file the sufile may actually have more than one trace but only the first trace is used examples suplane suwind min 12 max 12 trace suconv data sufile trace here the su data file data is convolved trace by trace with the the single su trace trace suconv data filter 1 2 1 here the su data file data is convolved trace by trace with the the filter shown credits cwp jack k cohen michel dietrich caveats no space variable or time variable capacity the more than one trace allowed in sufile is the beginning of a hook to handle the spatially variant case trace header fields accessed ns trace header fields modified ns
