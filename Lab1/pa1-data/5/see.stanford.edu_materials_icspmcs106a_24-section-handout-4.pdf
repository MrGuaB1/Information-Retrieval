h13 section 2 page 1 mehran sahami handout 24 cs 106a october 22 2007 section handout 4 string processing portions of this handout by eric roberts and patrick young 1 adding commas to numeric strings chapter 8 exercise 13 page 290 when large numbers are written out on paper it is traditional at least in the united states to use commas to separate the digits into groups of three for example the number one million is usually written in the following form 1000000 to make it easier for programmers to display numbers in this fashion implement a method private string addcommastonumericstring string digits that takes a string of decimal digits representing a number and returns the string formed by inserting commas at every third position starting on the right for example if you were to execute the main program public void run while true string digits readline enter a numeric string if digits length 0 break println addcommastonumericstring digits your implementation of the addcommastonumericstring method should be able to produce the following sample run page 2 2 2 deleting characters from a string write a method public string removealloccurrences string str char ch that removes all occurrences of the character ch from the string str for example your method should return the values shown removealloccurrences this is a test t returns this is a es removealloccurrences summer is here e returns summr is hr removealloccurrences 0 returns 0 3 heap stack diagrams using the style of heap stack diagram introduced in chapter 7 show the state of both the heap and the stack at the point in the computation indicated by the arrow in the following code where the rationale class is the one defined in chapter 6 public void run rational r new rational 1 2 r raisetopower r 3 println r 3 r private rational raisetopower rational x int n rational result new rational 1 for int i 0 i n i++ result result multiply x return result diagram at this point indicate which values in the heap are garbage at this point in the calculation page 3 3 4 tracing method execution for the program below show what output is produced by the program when it runs file mystery java this program doesn t do anything useful and exists only to test your understanding of method calls and parameter passing import acm program public class mystery extends consoleprogram public void run ghost 13 private void ghost int x int y 0 for int i 1 i x i 2 y witch y skeleton x i println ghost x x y y private int witch int x int y x 10 x y println witch x x y y return x private int skeleton int x int y return x y 2
