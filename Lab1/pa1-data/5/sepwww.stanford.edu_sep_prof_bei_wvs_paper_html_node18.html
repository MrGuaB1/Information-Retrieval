velocity increasing linearly with depth next up previous print clean next prior rms velocity up curved wavefronts previous can i abandon the velocity increasing linearly with depth theoreticians are delighted by velocity increasing linearly with depth because it happens that many equations work out in closed form for example rays travel in circles we will need convenient expressions for velocity as a function of traveltime depth and rms velocity as a function of traveltime depth let us get them we take the interval velocity v z increasing linearly with depth 42 this presumption can also be written as a differential equation 43 the relationship between z and vertical two way traveltime see equation 27 is also given by a differential equation 44 letting and applying the chain rule gives the differential equation for 45 whose solution gives us the desired expression for interval velocity as a function of traveltime depth 46 next up previous print clean next prior rms velocity up curved wavefronts previous can i abandon the stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
