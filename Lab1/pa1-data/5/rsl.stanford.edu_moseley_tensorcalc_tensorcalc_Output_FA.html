fractional anisotropy fa if full tensor data acquisition is applied the fractional anisotropy is calculated from the eigenvalues l 1 l 2 l 3 of the diffusion tensor where l is the mean diffusivity trace 3 fa takes on values between 0 perfectly isotropic diffusion and 1 the hypothetical case of an infinite cylinder and is thus directly comparable between subjects we here multiply fa by 1000 definition of fa can be found in basser pj and pierpaoli c microstructural and physiological features of tissues elucidated by quantitative diffusion tensor mri jmr b 111 209 219 1996 medline citation example fa map
