description of bilinear interpolation pattern matching interpolation people have observed that there's a high degree of correlation between the rgb channels in natural scenes the idea here is to exploit the correlations between the green red and blue components and determine the missing components from the pixel contexts since green is sampled with the highest sampling frequency the reproduction of the green components is much more accurate than the reproduction of the red or blue components for this reason this algorithm specifically targets at the interpolations of chrominance channels interpolation of green pixels use any method described before interpolation of red blue pixels estimate red blue values at green pixels use any method described before for instance use bilinear interpolation ie use the average of two adjacent color samples estimate blue values at red pixels first let's define pattern p x y for a red pixel at position x y refer to figure 5 as a four dimensional vector or a green pattern p x y g x 1 y g x 1 y g x y 1 g x y 1 where g x y is the green value at position x y next compare the green pattern p x y with its four neighboring green patterns and measure their similarities by where denotes the l 1 norm of a vector sort these delta values and let the ith largest value therefore define some threshold value t the actual algorithm is as follows if t then we have high confidence that the image is smooth around x y so the blue value is the average of all four adjacent diagonal pixel values else the desired blue value let's refer to a real example now consider figure 5 we want to estimate the blue value at r15 figure 5 the procedures are p15 g14 g16 g9 g21 p8 g7 g9 g2 g14 p10 g9 g11 g4 g16 p20 g19 g21 g14 g26 p22 g21 g23 g16 g28 sort them suppose the result is estimate red values at blue pixels can be carried out analogously for reference refer to 10
