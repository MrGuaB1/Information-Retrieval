american spirit the american spirit of creativity and crossover richard powers americans have long emphasized creative personal expression in their dancing along with the informal adaptation of steps from one dance into another known as crossover it seems that the prototypical american dancer is more intent on bending the rules than adhering to them i should clarify that i m not saying that the american approach is better than others only different way back when until the 20th century americans emulated the european prototype and did their best to dance and dress in the styles of london and paris they were painfully aware that europeans considered them rough hewn and socially unskilled this changed at the beginning of the 20th century with a prevailing american sentiment to make a clean break with the past and be progressive the lore of the american pioneers with their independence and freedom was popular at that time and the ragtime music of rural african americans was rapidly gaining enthusiasts americans grew less embarrassed about their differences from european culture and increasingly proud of their uniqueness they also began to feel comfortable with their identity as a melting pot of diverse cultural influences as american music and dance became a synthesis of european african caribbean and latin american influences at the turn of the century paris and london were still considered to be the supreme arbiters of culture and good taste so when both the french and english became wildly fond of american ragtime music and dance between 1900 and 1914 this gave an official seal of approval to americans creativity since this break from the rules and formalities of european culture americans have never looked back after centuries of european dominance of social dance forms most 20th century social dances came from the americas lindy hop swing foxtrot quickstep charleston evolving into hip hop blues hustle and club two step tango samba mambo salsa and cha cha from south america and cuba shared this western spirit of creativing and crossover there were significant european contributions to exhibition dance forms for stage in ballet flamenco irish step dancing and more but most of the innovations in social dance came from the americas and today this american tradition of creativity and crossover is still alive traditional dance does not mean old because traditions continue to evolve to merely collect the steps created by others perhaps by learning a swing step that frankie manning invented in 1935 is missing the point of creativity the way to capture the authentic spirit of american vernacular dance is to participate in the ongoing evolution oneself to truly learn from frankie manning's example emulate his creative process not just his steps american dance is innovative in spirit and multicultural in its influences creativity and crossover are its trademarks more thoughts and musings
