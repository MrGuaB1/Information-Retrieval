a dipping reflector next up previous print clean next dipping reflector shifts up migration defined previous migration defined a dipping reflector consider the zero offset seismic survey shown in figure 1 this survey uses one source receiver pair and the receiver is always at the same location as the source at each position denoted by in the figure the source emits waves and the receiver records the echoes as a single seismic trace after each trace is recorded the source receiver pair is moved a small distance and the experiment is repeated reflexpt figure 1 raypaths and wavefronts for a zero offset seismic line shot above a dipping reflector the earth's propagation velocity is constant view burn build edit restore as shown in the figure the source at s 2 emits a spherically spreading wave that bounces off the reflector and then returns to the receiver at s 2 the raypaths drawn between s i and r i are orthogonal to the reflector and hence are called normal rays these rays reveal how the zero offset section misrepresents the truth for example the trace recorded at s 2 is dominated by the reflectivity near reflection point r 2 where the normal ray from s 2 hits the reflector if the zero offset section corresponding to figure 1 is displayed the reflectivity at r 2 will be falsely displayed as though it were directly beneath s 2 which it certainly is not this lateral mispositioning is the first part of the illusion the second part is vertical if converted to depth the zero offset section will show r 2 to be deeper than it really is the reason is that the slant path of the normal ray is longer than a vertical shaft drilled from the surface down to r 2 next up previous print clean next dipping reflector shifts up migration defined previous migration defined stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
