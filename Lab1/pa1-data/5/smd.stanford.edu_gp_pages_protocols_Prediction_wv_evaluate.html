weighted voting class prediction evaluate existing classifier weighted voting class prediction evaluate existing classifier protocols to evaluate an existing weighted voting classifier run the weightedvoting module with the classifier model file and a test data set before you begin evaluating an existing classifier requires a model odf file that contains the weighted voting classifier example file all_aml_train preprocessed wv model odf a gene expression data set against which to test the classifier gct or res file that contains gene expression data example file all_aml_test gct cls file that identifies the class of each sample in the gene expression data example file all_aml_test cls learn more file formats step 1 weightedvoting to test a previously built weighted voting classifier run the weightedvoting module specify the classifier model odf and the test data set the module creates a prediction results file pred odf that assesses the accuracy of the predictor open weightedvoting open weightedvoting with example data learn more weightedvoting step 2 view results to view the prediction results file pred odf use the predictionresultsviewer module the viewer lists each sample with its actual and predicted class open predictionresultsviewer open predictionresultsviewer with example data considerations the predictionresultsviewer provides an absolute error rate incorrect cases total cases and an roc error rate fraction of true positives versus the fraction of false positives use the roc error rate for comparing results across data sets learn more predictionresultsviewer
