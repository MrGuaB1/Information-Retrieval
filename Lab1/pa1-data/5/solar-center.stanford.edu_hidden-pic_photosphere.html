the solar photosphere the solar photosphere the sun is made up of layers of material like a baseball or rubber band ball the photosphere is the lowest layer of the solar atmosphere it is essentially the solar surface that we see when we look at the sun in white ie regular or visible light when we observe sunspots and faculae bright little cloud like features we are observing them in the photosphere like the sun our planet earth is made up of layers too the thickest or most dense material on the earth is in the very middle of our planet the core the thinest is at the very top of our atmosphere right next to outer space the same is true of the sun but the layers in the sun and the earth are much different earth core mantle crust troposphere stratosphere ionosphere sun core radiative zone convection zone photosphere chromosphere corona if we looked at a slice through the middle of the earth it would look something like this a slice through the middle of the sun would show layers too but they would be different than earth's the photosphere of the sun is like the crust of the earth in some ways both the photosphere and the crust are many miles thick the top of the crust is the surface of the earth if we could stand on the moon and look at the earth we would see it's surface its crust if we look at the sun we see the photosphere do not look directly at the sun our pictures of the sun are taken through a telescope with a special filter we walk around on the surface of the earth not so for the sun the photosphere is not solid you would fall right through and the sun is very hot about 5000 degrees centigrade ouch most stars have photospheres so the image of the solar photosphere is like something you would see if you were able to fly over almost any star and look down on it it's a picture of a star scape granulation the surface of the sun like the surface of a boiling pot is constantly changing when we talk about solar granulation we mean the cell structure or bubbly look of the photosphere the boiling nature of the sun allows heat from the core to be brought up through the convection zone and into the photosphere just like heat from the bottom of a pan ends up heaing the entire contents and the air above it would you like to learn more about solar granulation take our solar granulation quick quiz and you can read what some of the granulation researchers are discovering http solar center stanford edu hidden pic photosphere html
