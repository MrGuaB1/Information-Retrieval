abstract of mechanics of porous elastic materials containing multiphase fluid abstract of the paper mechanics of porous elastic materials containing multiphase fluid with lewis thigpen a continuum theory of mixtures for a porous elastic solid saturated by immiscible viscous fluids is presented the theory includes micro inertial effects for the local fluctuation in volume fractions of the solid and fluid constituents gradients of volume fraction of both the elastic solid and fluid constituents are included in the constitutive variables equations governing the macroscopic motion are developed and show that the present theory contains both biot's equations and multiphase darcy flow through porous media as special cases electronic copies of this paper are not available
