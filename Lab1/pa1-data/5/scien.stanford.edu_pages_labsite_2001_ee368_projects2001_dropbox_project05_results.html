results measurement principle to check the robustness of our watermark we test an attacked image against several different keys and studied the discrimination of our watermark frequential watermarking original lena watermarked lena difference frequency discrimination to random keys lena with gaussian noise frequential watermark robustness to gaussian noise variance 0.01 we notice that although the image is heavily degraded we can still identify the watermark resistance to collusion frequential pick randomly from 10 copies the resistance is good for random pick or averaging with 10 watermarks for a higher number of watermarks used in collusion we cannot retrieve the original watermark cropped image of watermarked lena filled with original image resistance to cropping we only kept one quarter of the watermarked image watermarking in the frequential domain allows very good resistance to cropping attacks spatial watermarking original einstein watermarked einstein difference einstein with gaussian noise resistance to gaussian noise variance 0.02 we notice that although the image is heavily degraded we can still identify the watermark einstein scaled and cropped 2 magnified resistance to scaling and cropping watermarking in the spatial domain allows because of its redundancy very good resistance to scaling cropping attacks einstein stirmarked resistance to stirmark the spatial algorithm being highly redundant offers very good resistance to stirmark robust watermarking attacks implementation results conclusion
