future of led lighting future of led lighting just like the moore's law in processors led output lumens and efficiency lumens watt have doubled every 18 24 months lumileds luxeon star left lightwave 4000 10x nichia 5.6 cd flashlight right single lumiled luxeon star white led current output 18 lumens equivilant to 19 nichia leds current efficiency 17 lumens watt expected output 50 100 lumens end of 2002 expected efficiency 25 lumens watt the latest generation of leds such as the lumileds luxeon are high current high flux devices high flux units will allow leds to be used in many more lighting applications without having to resort to costly led arrays a single led will also provide light from a point source which can be a critical factor for certain applications that require dynamic focusing the future of leds for lighting is very bright indeed thanks for reading back next
