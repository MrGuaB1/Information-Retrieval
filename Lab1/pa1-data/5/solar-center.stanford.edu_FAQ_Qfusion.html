stanford solar center ask a solar physicist faqs answer how is hydrogen fused into helium by amara graps in the sun the primary process is called the proton proton chain in this reaction four protons these are the hydrogen nuclei are fused into one helium nucleus also called an alpha particle an alpha particle has about 1 less mass than four protons the rest of the mass is turned into gamma rays high energy photons the sun converts about 5 million tons of mass into energy every second don t worry there's enough for a long time here is the reaction in chemical notation 4 1h 2 e 4he 2 neutrinos 6 photons fusion can only happen when they can get close to each other it is a process that actually has several stages because the protons 1h both have a positive charge and at lower temperatures they repel each other but because the gas in the center of the sun is so hot the protons can hit each other with high speed when they get close to each other a natural force in nature for tiny distances the strong nuclear force can bind the particles together several other intermediate steps take place where electrons and antielectrons annihilate each other more protons collide into each other and a helium atom is made and with the helium and neutrons and protons bouncing around in the hot gas when they get close to each other new particles are created so you see our one equation above has many steps in chemical notation it looks like 1h 1h 2h antielectron neutrino 1h 1h 2h antielectron neutrino electron antielectron photon photon electron antielectron photon photon 2h 1h 3he photon 2h 1h 3he photon 3he 3he 4he 1h+ 1h or rewriting 6 1h 2 e 4he 2 1h 2 neutrinos 6 photons which is just our original equation above 4 1h 2 e 4he 2 neutrinos 6 photons click here for more info including diagrams and a more detailed explanation back to the faqs back to the solar center comments special thanks to a graps
