fitting with extrapolation filters previous up next print clean next interpretation up methods previous differencing fitting with extrapolation filters independent source gathers from the same shot point have nearly identical ground roll power spectra their phases do not match precisely and so some fitting is required to match the ground roll in the two gathers similar to the cross equalization of rickett 1997 here i use an extrapolation filter which attempts to predict traces in one shot gather from the corresponding traces in another the filter estimation can be written simply as 1 where is a trace or window from one shot gather and operator is convolution of the identical window from another shot gather with the filter ground roll is typically the dominant energy in raw shot gathers so basic l 2 least squares is suitable to remove it in contrast to numerous other recent sep projects where robust l 1 solvers have been desired the natural output in this case has more than two dimensions because comparing any two source impacts produces an output the size of a shot gather thus for the six recorded impacts there are fifteen possible output gathers in this example each impact is compared with the next in the recording order so that equation 1 is really 2 there are more available impact record combinations for instance a filter a 25 could be estimated the plotted outputs are really the residual after applying the filters estimated by equation 2 to combine them here i just square and sum the planes and convolve with a first derivative wavelet to remove the zero frequency and restore the wavefield appearance the results are shown before and after the convolution in figure 4 mineout figure 4 output from the mine data left panel is five residual panels squared and summed right panel is first derivative of left view burn build edit restore previous up next print clean next interpretation up methods previous differencing stanford exploration project 10 14 1997
