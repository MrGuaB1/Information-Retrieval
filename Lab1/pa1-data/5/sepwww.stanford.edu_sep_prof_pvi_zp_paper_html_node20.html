inverse filters next up previous print clean next the unit circle up instability previous anticausality inverse filters let b t denote a filter then a t is its inverse filter if the convolution of a t with b t is an impulse function filters are said to be inverse to one another if their fourier transforms are inverse to one another so in terms of z transforms the filter a z is said to be inverse to the signal of b z if a z b z 1 what we have seen so far is that the inverse filter can be stable or unstable depending on the location of its poles likewise if b z is a filter then a z is a usable filter inverse to b z if a z b z 1 and if a z does not have coefficients that tend to infinity another approach to inverse filters lies in the fourier domain there a filter inverse to b t is the a t made by taking the inverse fourier transform of if b z has its zeros outside the unit circle then a t will be causal otherwise not in the fourier domain the only danger is dividing by a zero which would be a pole on the unit circle in the case of z transforms zeros should not only be off the circle but also outside it so the domain seems safer than the z domain why not always use the fourier domain the reasons we do not always inverse filter in the domain along with many illustrations are given in chapter next up previous print clean next the unit circle up instability previous anticausality stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
