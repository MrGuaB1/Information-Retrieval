project title decorrelating transforms with color images student charles mathis cmathis stat stanford edu description this project will look at different ways of using the eigendecomposition decorrelation ideas of the karhunen loeve transform for color images these images are vector valued for each pixel yielding different components to decorrelate this project will try three approaches first decorrelating the three colors transforming to three decorrelated variables spanning the color space and then spatially decorrelating each variable second spatially decorrelating each color component and then decorrelating the three color variables third decorrelating the joint color space distribution ie regarding the image as 3 n 2 pixels and decorrelating them this project will use a training set of images to develop a transform for each of these three approaches and compare performance ie energy concentration ability within and outside of the training set
