interval velocity by linear moveout previous up next print clean next graphical method for interval up slanted waves previous snell waves in fourier interval velocity by linear moveout linear moveout forms the basis for a simple graphical method for finding seismic velocity the method is particularly useful for the analysis of data that is no longer in a computer but just exists on a piece of paper additionally the method offers insights beyond those offered by the usual computerized hyperbola scan using it will help us rid ourselves of the notion that angles should be measured from the vertical ray non zero snell parameter can be the default ultimately this method leads to a definition of velocity spectrum a plane in which the layout of data after a linear invertible transformation shows the seismic velocity graphical method for interval velocity measurement common midpoint snell coordinates differential equations and fourier transforms processing possibilities previous up next print clean next graphical method for interval up slanted waves previous snell waves in fourier stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
