4 matched filtering the matched filter method for detection of microcalcifications can not be optimized due to such uncertainties as not knowing the actual calcifications and having a background that is non stationary and thus indeterminate 3 one of the major problems with the matched filter detection is the tendency of the filter to highly correlate with high intensity portions of the mammograms hence when the mammograms are dense it is difficult to get accurate detection filtering the dense high frequency areas is not an option since the calcifications are high frequency in nature and a filter would remove the calcifications themselves the threshold detection of the correlation peaks that was incorporated into the matched filtering algorithm worked well but a variable threshold tailored to specific mammograms would allow the algorithm to work better figure 8 is a representation of the type of outputs that were seen with the matched filtering technique this specific mammogram contained a large number of microcalcifications which was correctly detected by the matched filter a b c figure 8 a original image b before adaptive threshold c after adaptive threshold
