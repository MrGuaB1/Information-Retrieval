publications by joe dellinger on line on line papers i ve picked these papers out as ones that random browsers might find enjoyable and or useful let me know what you think 3 core sample sketches a recent paper of mine from geophysics do traveltimes in pulse transmission experiments yield anisotropic group or phase velocities if you think you ve been measuring group velocities but aren t 100 sure perhaps you d better read this a tutorial paper from the 1992 fifth international workshop on seismic anisotropy dix revisited a formalism for rays in layered media confused about the schoenberg muir calculus despairing about the math involved in solving for anisotropic moveout equations then this may be the paper for you a paper from the leading edge about the uses of e mail electronic mail for geophysicists but then if you re reading this on line you probably know all about e mail already tilted layer grid interpolation an old paper of mine from geophysics modeling elastic fields across irregular boundaries this paper shows how to interpolate tilted elastic constant boundaries onto a regular grid elliptically anisotropic seismic survey my first very short paper in geophysics imaging reflections in elliptically anisotropic media once you realize elliptical anisotropy is just linear transformed isotropy you have the key to understanding it completely two reciprocal experiments an old tutorial paper of mine from the leading edge eisner's reciprocity paradox and its resolution if you ve ever been confused about reciprocity you might find this paper helpful or if you want to make a geophysicist squirm tell them the paradox but not the solution it worked on me go back to my home page
