blocky models next up previous print clean next inverse linear interpolation up null space and interval previous lateral variations blocky models sometimes we seek a velocity model that increases smoothly with depth through our scattered measurements of good quality rms velocities other times we seek a blocky model where seismic data is poor a well log could tell us whether to choose smooth or blocky here we see an estimation method that can choose the blocky alternative or some combination of smooth and blocky consider the five layer model in figure each layer has unit traveltime thickness so integration is simply summation let the squared interval velocities be a b c d e with strong reliable reflections at the base of layer c and layer e and weak incoherent bad reflections at bases of a b d thus we measure v c 2 the rms velocity squared of the top three layers and v e 2 that for all five layers since we have no reflection from at the base of the fourth layer the velocity in the fourth layer is not measured but a matter for choice in a smooth linear fit we would want d c+e 2 in a blocky fit we would want d e rosales figure 4 a layered earth model the layer interfaces cause reflections each layer has a constant velocity in its interior view our screen for good reflections looks like 0 0 1 0 1 and our screen for bad ones looks like the complement 1 1 0 1 0 we put these screens on the diagonals of diagonal matrices and our fitting goals are 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 for the blocky solution we do not want the fitting goal 25 further explanations await completion of examples next up previous print clean next inverse linear interpolation up null space and interval previous lateral variations stanford exploration project 4 27 2004
