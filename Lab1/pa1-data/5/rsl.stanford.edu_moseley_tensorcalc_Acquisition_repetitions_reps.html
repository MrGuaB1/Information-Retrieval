dti data acquisition how many repetitions should i do at each b value when you have time to do multiple repetitions for each direction there are basically three approaches to take for example with time for 6 measurements you can do 6 different b values spread out evenly over the range of b values you re applying and do a least squares fit to all points or you can do eg 2 repetitions at b 0 and 4 repetitions at the high b value and then do a least square fit to those 6 points or you can do 2 and 4 repetitions as above but then average all measurements at each b value for a given direction prior to calculation of adc based on the two averaged values the literature suggests that option 2 and 3 are superior to option 1 see for example xing d et al optimised diffusion weighting for measurement of apparent diffusion coefficient adc in human brain magn reson imaging 15 771 784 1997 medline citation or jones dk horsfield ma and simmons a optimal strategies for measuring diffusion in anisotropic systems by magnetic resonance imaging mrm 42 515 525 1999 medline citation in addition simulations not published have shown that options 2 and 3 are basically equivalent of the two we have chosen option 2 because it computationally applies to option 1 as well
