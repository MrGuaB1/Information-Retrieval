dipole histogram uniqueness theorem julesz first realized that the first order statistics color histogram cannot help to get the visual structure because it is invariant to pixel permutation since vision is primarily concerned as relationship between colors across space and time the dipole may be a useful tool doner has argued that human sensitivity to some aspect of spatial pattern is reflected by various measures of dipole histogram entropy nonetheless the dipole histogram would be of limited value if it can t be uniquely determined from an image dipole histogram uniqueness theorem any finite two dimensional image i is uniquely determined by its dipole histogram any finite discrete two dimensional image i comprising m 1 rows and n 1 columns can be constructed using only those of its short dipoles ie those dipoles dy dx with dy ceil m 1 2 and dx ceil n 1 2 definition of dipole histogram d dx dy a b number of pairs x1 y1 x2 y2 such that i x1 y1 a and i x2 y2 b and x2 y2 x1 y1 dx dy where a b are intensity values apparently d contains no locational information proof s m n sum d m n a b a for a 0 l 1 b 0 l 1 l intensity value s m n sum d m n a b a sum i x y i x m y n for x m 1 m y n 1 n i m n s m n s m 1 n s m n 1 s m 1 n 1 by this algorithm all i m n can be generated the second algorithm can also be easily shown by divide the whole image into four quadrants and use the d m n a b for m n ceil m 2 n 2 actually the 2 reconstructions are equivalent the first uses d m n a b m n 0 m 1 0 n 1 the second one uses m n ceil m 2 n 2 the two versions of dipole histogram uniqueness theorem are implemented as reconstr m and reconstrhalf m a coin flip image has been chosen to show the correct reconstruction of the algorithm original reconstructed by dipole range 0 m 1 reconstructed by dipole ceil m 2 ceil m 2 the reconstructed images have been examined by matlab to be the same as the original
