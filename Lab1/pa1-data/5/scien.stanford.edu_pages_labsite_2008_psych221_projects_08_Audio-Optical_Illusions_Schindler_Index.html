ee 361 psych 221 psych 221 final project audio optical illusions patrick schindler introduction methods results conclusions references appendix i introduction what we are interested in here is effect of sound stimulus on visual perception the kind of questions we want to ask are can sound change the way you visually perceive your environment can a sound create an optical illusion can a sound break an optical illusion how tightly wound are sound and vision to answer these questions i have set up a series of audio optical illusions that attempt to highlight the effects that sound can have on vision many of the illusions that i created either failed or could not be tuned well enough to create reliable results i was able to come up with a small working subset of illusions they are listed below the bounce illusion the assumption illusion the flying ball illusion the ventriloquism illusion the multiple bounce illusion at this point i should make a clarification there really is nothing new under the sun of illusions so what i really did was recreate the above illusions they have all been done before and i am not the first to search in vein for a new illusion i probably should have taken brian's advice up front when told me that there are not many illusions like this why is that why aren t there that many audio optical illusions seems like there should be to me we will try to answer that question too
