description of bilinear interpolation cubic convolution interpolation we will rely on system kernel convolution to describe this interpolation scheme in general interpolation can be expressed as where h is the interpolation kernel and c x y is the data sample itself at a pixel x k y l apparently in this formation h the interpolation kernel is the main part of the interpolation algorithm cubic convolution is a third degree interpolation using 16 adjacent pixels and some typical cubic convolution kernels are one variable cubic interpolation and the parameter a has been reported as 1 in 22 0.5 in 23 and 0.75 in 24 two variable cubic interpolation 25 where b and c are two parameters and b c 0.33 0.33 b c 1.5 0.25 have been reported in 26 cubic b spline interpolation 27 cubic b spline is the three degree b spline
