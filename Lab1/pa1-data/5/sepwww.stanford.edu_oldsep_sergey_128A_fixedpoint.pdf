fixed point iteration example function page 1 math 128a spring 2002 handout 5 sergey fomel february 5 2002 fixed point iteration mathematica notebook http math lbl gov fomel 128a fixedpoint nb example function we will study fixed point iteration using the function f x x2 x e x 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 figure 1 plotting the function f x shows that it has a root around 1.25 there are several ways to transform the equation f x 0 to the form x g x suitable for the fixed point iteration g1 x e x x2 g2 x e x x g3 x ln x x2 g4 x 1 e x x which of these functions cause the fixed point iteration to converge let us study this graphically 1 page 2 0 1 2 3 4 c0 1.4 c1 1.7134 c2 2.7555 c3 7.5292 0 1 2 3 4 e x x 2 c0 c1 c2 figure 2 the function g1 x clearly causes the iteration to diverge away from the root convergence analysis newton's iteration newton's iteration can be defined with the help of the function g5 x x f x f x 2 page 3 0 1 2 3 4 c0 3.9 c1 1.97996 c2 1.45535 c3 1.29949 0 1 2 3 4 c0 c1 c2 figure 3 the function g2 x leads to convergence although the rate of convergence is slow 3 page 4 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 c0 1.2 c1 1.42712 c2 0.495043 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 log x x 2 c0 c1 figure 4 in the case of g3 x the iteration diverges spiraling away from the root 4 page 5 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 c0 1.9 c1 1.07872 c2 1.31522 c3 1.20409 c4 1.24912 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 1 e x x c0 c1 c2 c3 figure 5 in the case of g4 x the iteration converges spiraling towards the root 5 page 6 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 c0 2.9 c1 1.77643 c2 1.33191 c3 1.23952 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x e x x x2 1 e x 2 x c0 c1 c2 figure 6 the iteration convergence very fast due to the fact that the function g5 x has zero slope around the root 6 page 7 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 c0 2.9 c1 1.77643 c2 1.33191 c3 1.23952 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 newton's method c0 c1 c2 figure 7 another way to display the newton iteration is by using tangent lines 7
