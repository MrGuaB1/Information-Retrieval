eric roberts page 1 mehran sahami handout 11 cs 106a october 5 2007 simple programming patterns based on a handout by eric roberts this handout summarizes some of the most common programming patterns that you will encounter in java each of these patterns is covered in more detail in chapters 2 3 or 4 of the textbook but it's good to have them in a simple handy reference as well the first set of patterns involves getting data in and out of the computer which provide the necessary support for the input and output phases of a typical programming task the patterns you use depend on the type of value as shown in the following table type declaration input pattern integer int var value var readint prompt floating point double var value var readdouble prompt string string var value var readline prompt the following patterns are useful in calculations english java long form java shorthand form add y to x x x y x y subtract y from x x x y x y add 1 to x increment x x x 1 x++ subtract 1 from x decrement x x x 1 x the most helpful patterns however encompass programming operations on a larger scale and help you establish the overall strategy of a program the most important ones are described in the next few sections the repeat n times pattern page 101 this pattern is the same as it was in karel and is used for the same purpose for int i 0 i n i++ statements to be repeated in java however you are allowed to use the value of the index variable i in the body of the loop the read until sentinel pattern page 102 this pattern is useful whenever you need to read in values until the user enters a particular value to signal the end of input such values are called sentinels while true prompt user and read in a value if value sentinel break rest of body
