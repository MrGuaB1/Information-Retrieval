twisted conjugacy page 1 twisted conjugacy january 15 2004 if g is a nite group and g g is an automorphism then twisted conjugacy with respect to is the action of g on itself by g x 7 gxg the orbits of this action are called twisted conjugacy classes theorem 1 let g be a nite group and let g g an automorphism of degree m the following three numbers are equal i the number of twisted conjugacy classes ii the number of invariant conjugacy classes iii the number of invariant irreducible representations of g proof there are two permutation actions of hi which we may consider the action on the conjugacy classes of g and the action on the irreducible repre sentations of g both permutation actions are realized on the center of c g the rst by taking the basis of the center comprised of the conjugacy class sums the second by taking the basis of central idempotents parametrized by the irreducible representations thus these actions are equivalent and the number of invariant representations equals the number of invariant conjugacy classes we must therefore show that the number of invariant conjugacy classes equals the number of twisted conjugacy classes we will count the number n of solutions x g to the equation g 1 xg x in two di erent ways first n equals x x x fg 2 gjg 1 xg xg x x x jcg x j because given x which is conjugate to x we may count the number of g conjugating x to x by xing one such g then noting that any other such g 1 page 2 must di er from that one by an element of the centralizer jc g x j because the number of elements of the conjugacy class of x is jgj jc g x j we see that n is jgj times the number of invariant conjugacy classes on the other hand n equals x g2g fx 2 gjxg x 1 gg the index in g of fx 2 gjxg x 1 g g is the order of the twisted conjugacy class of g so this is jgj times the number of twisted conjugacy classes we are interested in twisted conjugacy for the group g f qm gl n f qm where is the frobenius x 7 x q the story of twisted conjugacy is in timately connected with the norm map n g f qm g f qm de ned by n g g g 2 g m1 g if n 1 so that g gl 1 is abelian this map takes values in gl 1 f q so we might hope that the norm map takes gl n f qm into gl n f q this is not true what is true is that the map n induces a map from conjugacy classes of gl n f qm to conjugacy classes of gl n f q theorem 2 shintani let be the frobenius endomorphism of gl n f qm i if g 1 and g2 are twisted conjugates then n g 1 and n g 2 are conjugates ii if g 2 g f qm then n g is conjugate to an element of g f q iii the intersection of n x with gl n f q as x runs through the twisted conjugacy classes of gl n f qm is a single conjugacy class of gl n f q proof we have n xg 1x xn g 1 x 1 so i is clear for ii applying to n g gives g 1 n g g so the conjugacy class of n g is galois invariant we have shown in the lang map using both the rational canonical form and lang's theorem that this implies that the gl n f qm conjugacy class of n g contains an element of gl n f q for iii we also proved in the lang map using both the rational canon ical form and lang's theorem that two elements of gl n f q are conjugate in gl n f qm if and only if they are already conjugate in gl n f q and from this and i and ii the assertion is clear theorem 3 shintani the number of invariant irreducible representa tions of gl n f qm is equal to the number of irreducible representations of gl n f q 2 page 3 proof this follows from theorems 1 and 2 and the fact that the number of irreducible representations of a group is equal to the number of conjugacy classes note that the proofs above depend only on the lang map and are therefore also valid for parabolic subgroups 3
