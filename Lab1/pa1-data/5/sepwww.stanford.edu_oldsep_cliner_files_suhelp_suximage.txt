suximage x windows image plot of a segy data set suximage stdin optional parameters optional parameters n2 tr ntr or number of traces in the data set ntr is an alias for n2 d1 tr d1 or tr dt 10 6 sampling interval in the fast dimension 004 for seismic if not set 1.0 for nonseismic if not set d2 tr d2 sampling interval in the slow dimension 1.0 if not set key key for annotating d2 slow dimension if annotation is not at proper increment try setting d2 only first trace's key value is read f1 tr f1 or tr delrt 10 3 or 0.0 first sample in the fast dimension f2 tr f2 or tr tracr or tr tracl first sample in the slow dimension 1.0 for seismic if not set d2 for nonseismic if not set verbose 0 1 to print some useful information tmpdir if non empty use the value as a directory path prefix for storing temporary files else if the the cwp_tmpdir environment variable is set use its value for the path else use tmpfile note that for seismic time domain data the fast dimension is time and the slow dimension is usually trace number or range also note that foreign data tapes may have something unexpected in the d2 f2 fields use segyclean to clear these if you can afford the processing time or use d2 f2 to override the header values if not see the ximage selfdoc for the remaining parameters credits cwp dave hale and zhiming li ximage etc jack cohen and john stockwell suximage etc mtu david forel june 2004 added key for annotating d2 notes when the number of traces isn t known we need to count the traces for ximage you can make this value known either by getparring n2 or by having the ntr field set in the trace header a getparred value takes precedence over the value in the trace header when we must compute ntr we don t allocate a 2 d array but just content ourselves with copying trace by trace from the data file to the pipe into the plotting program although we could use tr data we allocate a trace buffer for code clarity
