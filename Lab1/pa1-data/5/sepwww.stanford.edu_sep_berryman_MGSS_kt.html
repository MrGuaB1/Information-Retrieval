another effective medium theory concept concept of kuster and toksoz schematic diagram of the model composite used in the non self consistent effective medium theory often called the ata or average t matrix approximation this approach is also due to kuster and toksoz in a geophysical setting the true composite is replaced by a large sphere dashed circle containing spherical inclusions of one of the constituents while the other serves as the host medium the scattering from the pictured composite is set equal to that from type for a spherical scatterer of the size shown the composite properties are obtained from the resulting equations which turn out to be identical to those for the hashin shtrikman bounds when the scatterers are spheres as we have assumed here concept of the cpa references
