stanford digital repository stanford digital repository a computational framework based on an embedded boundary method for nonlinear multi phase fluid structure interactions creator wang guanyuan contributor s farhat charbel primary advisor iaccarino gianluca advisor lew adrian advisor stanford university institute for computational and mathematical engineering description nonlinear fluid structure interaction fsi is a dominating feature in many important engineering applications examples include underwater implosions pipeline explosions flapping wings for micro aerial vehicles and shock wave lithotripsy due to the inherent nonlinearity and system complexity such problems have not been thoroughly analyzed which greatly hinders the advance of related engineering fields this thesis focuses on the development verification and validation of a fluid structure coupled computational framework for the solution of nonlinear multi phase fsi problems involving high compressions and shock waves large structural displacements and deformations self contact and possibly the initiation and propagation of cracks in the structure first an embedded boundary method for solving 3d multi phase compressible inviscid flows on arbitrary ie structured and unstructured non body conforming cfd grids is presented key components include 1 robust and efficient computational algorithms for tracking open closed and cracking fluid structure interfaces with respect to the fixed non body conforming cfd grid 2 a numerical algorithm based on the exact solution of local one dimensional fluid structure riemann problems to enforce the no interpenetration transmission condition at the fluid structure interface and 3 two consistent and conservative algorithms for enforcing the equilibrium transmission condition at the same interface next the multi phase compressible flow solver equipped with the aforementioned embedded boundary method is carefully coupled with an extended finite element method xfem based structure solver using a partitioned procedure and provably second order explicit explicit and implicit explicit time integrators in particular the interface tracking algorithms in the embedded boundary method are adapted to tracking embedded discrete interfaces with phantom elements and carrying implicitly represented cracks finally the resulting fluid structure coupled computational framework is applied to the solution of several challenging fsi problems in the fields of aeronautics underwater implosions and explosions and pipeline explosions to assess its performance in particular two laboratory experiments are considered for validation purpose the first one concerns the implosive collapse of an air filled aluminum cylinder the second one studies the dynamic fracture of pre flawed aluminum pipes driven by detonation waves in both cases the numerical simulation correctly reproduces in a quantitative sense the important features in the experiment kevin guanyuan wang submitted to the institute for computational and mathematical engineering thesis ph d stanford university 2011 view in searchworks 2011 by guanyuan wang this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution noncommercial 3.0 unported license file download description kevin_thesis_final augmented pdf 27.1 mb body of dissertation stanford university stanford california 94305 650 725 1064 terms of use copyright complaints
