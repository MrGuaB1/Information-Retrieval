soi mdi ssu 2000 backside press release accoustic imaging of the backside of the sun introduction movies and images coverage in the media introduction images of an active region on the far side of the sun were derived by applying seismic holography to recent helioseismic observations from space active regions are the centers of energetic phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections whose resulting electromagnetic and particle radiation interfere with telecommunications and power transmission on earth and can pose significant hazards to astronauts and spacecraft synoptic seismic imaging of far side solar activity will now allow us to anticipate the appearance of large active regions more than a week ahead of their arrival on the east solar limb postscript and acrobat pdf preprint versions of the paper are available see also the nasa press release site the esa press release movies and images the following images are clips from the movies quicktime 1.8 meg mpeg 1.7 meg quicktime 0.4 meg waves moving into farside quicktime 0.3 meg waves moving out of farside quicktime 0.3 meg quicktime 0.5 meg mpeg 0.3 meg mpeg 2.2 meg quicktime 0.6 meg mpeg 0.4 meg mpeg 3.9 meg mpeg 6.2 meg quicktime 0.9 meg mpeg 1.2 meg courtesy of nasa gsfc quicktime 3 meg eit images from gurman mpeg 0.5 meg high res 12 sec dopplergrams quicktime 36 meg mpeg 10 meg mpeg first 200 frames 2.2 meg full disk 1 min dopplergrams quicktime 11 meg mpeg 0.8 meg full disk continuum for 10 march 15 april 1998 quicktime 7 meg mpeg 0.4 meg full disk magnetograms for 10 march 15 april 1998 quicktime 19 meg mpeg 2.5 meg postscript gif tiff coverage in the media opening a view to the far side of the sun the washington post march 10 2000 soho sees through sun discovery march 10 2000 scientists see far side of the sun ms nbc march 9 2000 scientists see through sun for first time space com march 9 2000 scientists find way to see through sun predict disturbances cnn march 9 2000 glimpse of the far side abc news march 9 2000 satellite sees through sun to new solar storms yahoo news march 9 2000 scientists look through the sun bbc march 9 2000 peeking behind the sun us news online june 5 2000 seismic images of the far side of the sun science magazine march 2000 general info science objectives & proposals results images & documentation data services & info operations other links press releases solar center stanford solar group
