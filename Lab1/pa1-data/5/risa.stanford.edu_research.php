risa h wechsler risa h wechsler assistant professor kavli institute for particle astrophysics and cosmology physics department stanford university slac national accelerator laboratory rwechsler at stanford dot edu i work on topics in theoretical cosmology and astrophysics i am primarily interested in galaxy formation and the development of structure in the universe and in how galaxies and large scale structure can be used to probe the fundamental physics of the universe news see our movies about the cosmological context of the milky way galaxy current research interests include dark energy dark energy from large galaxy surveys cosmological constraints from galaxy clusters and galaxy clustering dark matter astrophysical probes of dark matter astrophysical systematics in direct and indirect detection of dark matter galaxy formation galaxy formation at high redshift galaxy formation at low masses evolution of galaxy properties as a function of environment the mass distribution and galaxy content of clusters reionization and galaxy formation galaxy formation from large galaxy surveys structure formation large numerical simulations assembly history and structure of galaxies and dark matter halos evolution of halo occupation and galaxy clustering i am involved in several observational survey projects sloan digital sky survey dark energy survey aegis lsst candels spitzer extended deep survey seds spitzer hetdex exploratory large area survey shela the herschel redshift survey hers interested if you are a stanford student or prospective stanford student interested in working with me drop me a line or stop by my office on campus or at slac kipac also hires at least a couple of postdocs each year and encourages propective candidates to apply for national fellowships if you are interested feel free to contact me with any questions research teaching outreach publications talks cv who who else what where elsewhere tools
