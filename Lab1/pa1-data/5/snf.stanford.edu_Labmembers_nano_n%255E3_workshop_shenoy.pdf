nanotechnology as an enabler for neuroscience neuroengineering and neural prosthetic systems nano for n3 page 1 nanotechnology as an enabler for neuroscience neuroengineering and neural prosthetic systems nano for n3 a national nanotechnology infrastructure network nnin workshop paul g allen center for integrated systems stanford university organizers prof yoshio nishi prof krishna shenoy december 11 12 2008 page 2 brief workshop intro for the network junkies login nano4n3 password nanoaccess special thanks to speakers participants paul rissman gabrielle brits cindy chestek high level overview of workshop goals talks today breakout sessions tomorrow to promote discussion time paul rissman quick logistics overview page 3 goals major workshop goals next slide arise from the following observations what is nanotechnology technology using engineered materials or devices with the smallest functional organization on nm scale in at least 1 dimension typically 1 100 nm implies some aspect of the material device can be manipulated and controlled by physical and or chemical means at nm resolution results in functional properties that are unique to the engineered technology not shown by its constituent elements nanotechnology has already had a substantial impact on neuroscience the study of the brain and nervous system and entails specific interactions with neurons and glial cells current research examples better interactions with neurons advanced molecular imaging materials and hybrid molecules used in neural regeneration neuroprotection and targeted delivery of drugs and small molecules across the blood brain barrier eg silva neuroscience nanotechnology progress opportunities and challenges nature reviews neuroscience 2006 perhaps this is just the beginning and its worthwhile considering 1 future needs and emerging opportunities and 2 real world factors such as characterizing the robustness of nano neural interfaces in vivo page 4 goals major workshop goals share recent advances and thinking on how nanotechnology might help enable next generation neuroscience neuroengineering & neural prostheses neuro x quite interdisciplinary so just understanding each other's language and needs is half the battle help identify specific needs and opportunities for nanotechnology to help with precision measurement and stimulation in neuro x applications from basic neuroscience at all scales molecular cellular circuits systems through clinically viable neural prostheses implantable stimulation recording systems multiple decade lifetimes zero risk zero cost etc help build language bridges and promote collaborations between nanotechnology community and neuro x communities help identify how nnin might leverage its tools user base and staff expertise to address needs accelerate solutions
