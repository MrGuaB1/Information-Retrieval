mad scripts home site map facilities user guide schedule forms research news staff links up download scripts user documentation mad scripts for rapid structure solution the ultimate way to validate a diffraction data collection experiment is to be able to extract meaningful phases from the data in the particular case of mad and sad experiments where the approach to structure solution is highly systematic it should be possible to attempt phasing and model building during the beamtime run an unfamiliar computing and software environment combined with increasingly fast paced experiments may preclude users from going beyond intensity integration and scaling to full on line structure solution the ssrl mad scripts are developed to facilitate this task hiding the complexities of the software installation on the macromolecular crystallography file server and providing automated input to all the programs in the structure solution pipeline with minimal edits from the part of the user for a detailed description of the script required input usage and output see the script documentation pages running the script on non ssrl computers you can copy or download the mad scripts and run then on your home computer please read the disclaimer and permission notice in addition to the scripts you can get mad test data set to test the scripts the solve_structure scripts require the following software ccp4 suite rebatch reindex sortmtz scala scaleit cad fft solve resolve optional shelx cde the first section of the script after the user edits sets site dependent environment variables you will most likely need to edit these the script runs on osf1 and linux it may run on other platforms without substantial modification but it has not been tested technical questions webmaster content questions ana gonzalez last modified saturday 21 jul 2007 17 04 46 pdt
