the sun's vital statistics stanford solar center about the sun for students for educators space weather monitors ancient observatories solar folklore solar art & literature the sun's vital statistics the sun is a rather commonplace celestial object it is a star of ordinary dimensions and of ordinary brightness but to observers on the earth the sun remains an object of magnificent proportions this fiery ball of superheated hydrogen and helium gases contains 99.9 percent of all matter in the solar system and a million earths could fit inside the sun with room to spare on this page we present some of the sun's vital statistics we think that you might be impressed with our magnificent star too age at least 4.5 billion years in present state distance mean distance from earth 1.5 x 10 8 km variation in distance through the year 1.5 percent diameter 1.39 x 10 6 km or 109 times the diameter of the earth and 9.75 times the diameter of jupiter volume 1.41 x 10 33 cm 3 or 1.3 million times the volume of the earth mass 1.99 x 10 30 kg or 333000 times the weight of the earth magnetic field strengths typical sunspots 3000 g polar field 1 g bright chromospheric network 25 g emphemeral unipolar active regions 20 g chromospheric plages 200 g prominences 10 to 100 g earth 0.7 g at pole chemical composition of photosphere by weight in percent hydrogen 73.46 helium 24.85 oxygen 0.77 carbon 0.29 iron 0.16 neon 0.12 nitrogen 0.09 silicon 0.07 magnesium 0.05 sulfur 0.10 density water 1 mean density of entire sun 1.41 g cm 3 interior center of the sun 160 g cm 3 surface photosphere 10 9 g cm 3 chromosphere 10 12 g cm 3 low corona 10 16 g cm 3 sea level atmosphere of earth 10 3 g cm 3 solar radiation entire sun 3.83 x 10 23 kw unit area of surface of sun 6.29 x 10 4 kw m 2 received at top of earth's atmosphere 0.136 w cm 2 surface brightness of the sun photosphere compared to full moon 398000 times compared to inner corona 300000 times compared to outer corona 10 10 times compared to daytime sky on pikes peak 100000 times compared to daytime sky at orange nj 1000 times temperature interior center 15000000 k surface effective of sun 5800 k sunspot umbra typical 4240 k penumbra typical 5680 k chromosphere 4300 to 50000 k corona 800000 to 3000000 k rotation as seen from the earth of solar equator 26.8 days at solar latitude 30 deg 28.2 days at solar latitude 60 deg 30.8 days at solar latitude 75 deg 31.8 days source of these numbers are from the book a new sun the solar results from skylab by john eddy nasa sp 402 1979 page 37 the effective solar temperature came from lang's astrophysical quantities pg 162 1964 another internet site with a smaller stats table but a nice overview of the important features of the sun can be found at calvin hamilton's views of the solar system sun home request solar posters site map glossary about us contact us 2008 by stanford solar center permitted uses credits
