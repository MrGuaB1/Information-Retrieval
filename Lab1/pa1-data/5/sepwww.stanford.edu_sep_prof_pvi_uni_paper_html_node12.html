estimating the noise variance next up previous print clean next colored noise up solution by weighting functions previous nonuniqueness and instability estimating the noise variance choosing is a subjective matter or at least how we choose could be the subject of a lengthy philosophical analysis perhaps that is why so much of the literature ignores this question without any firm theoretical basis i chose to be approximately the noise level i estimated this as follows the simplest method of choosing is to find the average v 2 in the plane and then choose some arbitrary fraction of it say 10 of the average although this method worked in figure 2 i prefer another i chose to be the median value of v 2 in other words we conceptually prepare a list of the numbers v 2 then we sort the list from smallest to largest and finally we choose the value in the middle in reality median calculation is quicker than sorting notice that figure 2 uses more initial crosstalk than figure 1 without the extra crosstalk i found that the first iteration worked so well the second one was not needed thus i could not illustrate the utility of nonlinear estimation without more crosstalk next up previous print clean next colored noise up solution by weighting functions previous nonuniqueness and instability stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
