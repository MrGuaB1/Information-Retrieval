what's the difference between homogenous and heterogenous nucleation questions kinetics of water rock interaction 1 what is the difference between homogenous and heterogeneous nucleation 2 the authors refer to different routes of surface area generation as nucleation or crystal growth controlled what is the difference between the two 3 gibbsite and muscovite are potential products of feldspar weathering why was nucleation of these constituents not observed in their weathering simulations on a related note why do thermodynamically less stable phases ie metastable phases such as halloysite in the feldspar halloysite kaolinite system form at early time points in their simulations while kaolinite the thermodynamically stable product is not seen until late time points 4 do you think the simulations performed by the authors could ever become truly quantitative why or why not 5 what are the major variables governing the rate of crystal growth and dissolution
