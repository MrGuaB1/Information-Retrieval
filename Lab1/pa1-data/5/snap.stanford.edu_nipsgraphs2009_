nips 2009 workshop on analyzing networks and learning with graphs by jure leskovec stanford university overview call for papers schedule invited speakers committee workshop on analyzing networks and learning with graphs nips 2009 december 11 2009 in whistler bc canada overview recent research in machine learning and statistics has seen the proliferation of computational methods for analyzing networks and learning with graphs these methods support progress in many application areas including the social sciences biology medicine neuroscience physics finance and economics the primary goal of the workshop is to actively promote a concerted effort to address statistical methodological and computational issues that arise when modeling and analyzing large collection of data that are largely represented as static and or dynamic graphs to this end we aim at bringing together researchers from applied disciplines such as sociology economics medicine and biology together with researchers from more theoretical disciplines such as mathematics and physics within our community of statisticians and computer scientists different communities use diverse ideas and mathematical tools our goal is to to foster cross disciplinary collaborations and intellectual exchange presentations will include novel graph models the application of established models to new domains theoretical and computational issues limitations of current graph methods and directions for future research call for papers call for papers invited speakers matthew jackson department of economics stanford university ravi kumar yahoo research martina morris departments of sociology and statistics university of washington cosma shalizi department of statistics cmu eric xing machine learning department cmu schedule 7 30 7 35 introduction by the organizers 7 35 8 15 matthew jackson identifying choice and chance in network formation 8 15 8 55 poster spotlight presentations 9 00 9 15 break and poster set up 9 15 9 55 eric xing dynamic network tomography 9 55 10 35 cosma shalizi homophily contagion confounding pick any three 10 35 3 30 break posters 3 30 4 15 martina morris partnership networks and hiv applications of dynamic ergms to understand epidemic disparities 4 15 5 00 ravi kumar compressibility of behavioral graphs 5 00 5 30 break posters 5 30 6 00 panel discussion and closing remarks accepted papers on doubly stochastic graph optimization by a bijral n srebro link based active learning by m bilgic l getoor fast and optimal algorithms for weighted graph prediction by n cesa bianchi c gentile f vitale g zappella chance constrained programs for link prediction by j doppa j yu p tadepalli l getoor multi label prediction for learning in relational graphs by y huang v tresp path and travel time inference from gps probe vehicle data by t hunter r herring p abbeel a bayen biological network integration and mining for microbial community analysis by c huttenhower from sensor network to social network a study on the energy impact in buildings by x jiang b dong l sweeney continuous time group discovery in dynamic graphs by k miller t eliassi rad learning latent structure in complex networks by m morup l hansen towards community detection in k partite k uniform hypergraphs by n neubauer inferring interests from mobility and social interactions by a noulas m musolesi m pontil c mascolo confident network indices with latent space models by j olson k carley hierarchies in dictionary definition space by o picard a masse s harnad o marcotte g chicoisne y gargouri the resistance distance is meaningless for large random geometric graphs by a radl u von luxburg m hein randomwalks with random projections by p sarkar collective classification with content and link noise by b senliol z cataltepe a sonmez mixed membership stochastic block models for transactional data by m shafiei h chipman marginally specified hierarchical models for relational data by a thomas j blitzstein variational bayesian inference for the latent position cluster model by m townsend b murphy learning curves for gaussian process regression on random graphs effects of graph structure by m urry p sollich learning the dynamics and strength of face to face interaction networks from situated speech data by d wyatt t choudhury j bilmes modeling relationship strength in by r xiang j neville m rogati active learning for hidden attributes in networks by x ran yan yj zhu jb rouquier c moore rumors in a network who's the culprit by t zaman location workshop is in westin room nordic the workshop will be held in conjunction with the 22nd annual conference on neural information processing systems whistler bc canada december 11 2009 organizers edoardo airoldi harvard university jon kleinberg cornell university jure leskovec stanford university josh tenenbaum mit email you can reach the organizers at nipsgraphs2009 gmail com workshop is kindly supported by
