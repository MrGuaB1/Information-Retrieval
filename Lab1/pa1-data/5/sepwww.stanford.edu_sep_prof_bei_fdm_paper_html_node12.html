first derivatives implicit method next up previous print clean next explicit heat flow equation up finite differencing in omega x space previous first derivatives explicit method first derivatives implicit method let us solve the equation 19 by numerical methods the most obvious but not the only approach is the basic definition of elementary calculus for the time derivative this is 20 using this in equation 19 yields the the inflation of money equations 17 and 18 where thus in the inflation of money equation the expression of dq dt is centered at whereas the expression of q by itself is at time t there is no reason the q on the right side of equation 19 cannot be averaged at time t with time thus centering the whole equation at when writing difference equations it is customary to write more simply as q t 1 formally one should say and write q n 1 instead of q t 1 but helpful mnemonic information is carried by using t as the subscript instead of some integer like n thus a centered approximation of 19 is 21 letting this becomes 22 which is representable as the difference star for a fixed this star gives a more accurate solution to the differential equation 19 than does the star for the inflation of money the reasons for the names explicit method and implicit method above will become clear only after we study a more complicated equation such as the heat flow equation next up previous print clean next explicit heat flow equation up finite differencing in omega x space previous first derivatives explicit method stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
