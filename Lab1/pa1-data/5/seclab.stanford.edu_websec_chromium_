the security architecture of the chromium browser the security architecture of the chromium browser most current web browsers employ a monolithic architecture that combines the user and the web into a single protection domain an attacker who exploits an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in such a browser can steal sensitive files or install malware in this paper we present the security architecture of chromium the open source browser upon which google chrome is built chromium has two modules in separate protection domains a browser kernel which interacts with the operating system and a rendering engine which runs with restricted privileges in a sandbox this architecture helps mitigate high severity attacks without sacrificing compatibility with existing web sites we define a threat model for browser exploits and evaluate how the architecture would have mitigated past vulnerabilities pdf the security architecture of the chromium browser adam barth collin jackson charles reis and the google chrome team technical report 2008 more stanford web security research
