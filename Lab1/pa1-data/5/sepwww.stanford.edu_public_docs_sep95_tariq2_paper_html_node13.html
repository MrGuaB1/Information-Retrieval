the amplitude transport equation previous up next print clean next about this document up vti processing in inhomogeneous previous the stretch factor in the amplitude transport equation to obtain the transport equation for this new domain coordinate system we use a ray theoretical model of the image as a trial solution to the wave equation 23 this procedure yields the eikonal equation as well as the transport equation that describes amplitude behavior a x y z of wave propagation substituting the trial solution into the partial differential equation 23 and considering only the terms with the highest asymptotic order those containing the fourth order derivative of f yields the eikonal equation 9 the next asymptotic order third order in derivatives of f gives us a linear partial differential equation of the amplitude transport as follows setting yields the corresponding transport equation for elliptically anisotropic media both transport equations include first and second order derivatives of time with respect to position calculated from the solution of the eikonal equation despite the apparent complexity of the transport equations they are linear and contain only first order derivates of a as expected amplitudes depend on second order derivatives of traveltime or wavefront curvature the dynamic raytracing equations behave similarly also we can see that equations 37 and 38 include terms corresponding to cross derivates of traveltime ie which result from the cross dependent nature of the new coordinate system some of these terms are caused by anisotropy alkhalifah 1997b when in equation 38 all such cross derivate terms drop out previous up next print clean next about this document up vti processing in inhomogeneous previous the stretch factor in stanford exploration project 10 9 1997
