another way to the parabolic wave equation next up previous print clean next muir square root expansion up higher angle accuracy previous higher angle accuracy another way to the parabolic wave equation here we review the historic transformation method of deriving the parabolic wave equation a vertically downgoing plane wave is represented mathematically by the equation 54 in this expression p 0 is absolutely constant a small departure from vertical incidence can be modeled by replacing the constant p 0 with something say q x z which is not strictly constant but varies slowly 55 inserting 55 into the scalar wave equation yields 56 the wave equation has been reexpressed in terms of q x z so far no approximations have been made to require the wavefield to be near to a plane wave q x z must be near to a constant the appropriate means which caused some controversy when it was first introduced is to drop the highest depth derivative of q namely q zz this leaves us with the parabolic wave equation 57 i called equation 57 the equation after using it for about a year i discovered a way to improve on it by estimating the dropped term differentiate equation 57 with respect to z and substitute the result back into equation 56 getting 58 i named equation 58 the migration equation it is first order in so it requires only a single surface boundary condition however downward continuation will require something more complicated than equation 53 the above approach the transformation approach was and is very useful but people were confused by the dropping and estimating of the derivative and a philosophically more pleasing approach was invented by francis muir a way of getting equations to extrapolate waves at wider angles by fitting the dispersion relation of a semicircle by polynomial ratios next up previous print clean next muir square root expansion up higher angle accuracy previous higher angle accuracy stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
