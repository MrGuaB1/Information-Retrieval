zhang automatic picking up next print clean next introduction up table of contents automatic picking and its applications lin zhang author has no known email address abstract i have developed a new automatic picking algorithm that can be applied to many picking problems in seismic data processing this algorithm does the initial picking by solving a constrained non linear optimization problem with a fast search algorithm then by linearizing the model of data the objective function defined in the optimization process is approximately reduced to a quadratic form the residual corrections are obtained by solving a linear equation i applied this algorithm to several practical problems including dip picking event picking well log interpolation and velocity picking examples with field data show that the results are reasonably accurate and reliable introduction objective functions error measure coherence measure relations non linear optimization unconstrained optimization constrained optimization viterbi algorithm linear optimization residual dip objective function and solution applications dip picking and event picking well log interpolation velocity picking conclusions acknowledgments references appendix a about this document up next print clean next introduction up table of contents stanford exploration project 12 18 1997
