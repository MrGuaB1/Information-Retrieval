phase shift migration next up previous print clean next pseudocode to working code up downward continuation previous linking snell waves to phase shift migration the phase shift method of migration begins with a two dimensional fourier transform 2d ft of the dataset see chapter this transformed data is downward continued with and subsequently evaluated at t 0 where the reflectors explode of all migration methods the phase shift method most easily incorporates depth variation in velocity the phase angle and obliquity function are correctly included automatically unlike kirchhoff methods with the phase shift method there is no danger of aliasing the operator aliasing the data however remains a danger equation 14 referred to upcoming waves however in the reflection experiment we also need to think about downgoing waves with the exploding reflector concept of a zero offset section the downgoing ray goes along the same path as the upgoing ray so both suffer the same delay the most straightforward way of converting one way propagation to two way propagation is to multiply time everywhere by two instead it is customary to divide velocity everywhere by two thus the fourier transformed data values are downward continued to a depth by multiplying by 15 ordinarily the time sample interval for the output migrated section is chosen equal to the time sample rate of the input data often 4 milliseconds thus choosing the depth the downward extrapolation operator for a single time step is 16 data will be multiplied many times by c thereby downward continuing it by many steps of pseudocode to working code kirchhoff versus phase shift migration damped square root adjointness and ordinary differential equations vertical exaggeration example vertical and horizontal resolution field data migration next up previous print clean next pseudocode to working code up downward continuation previous linking snell waves to stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
