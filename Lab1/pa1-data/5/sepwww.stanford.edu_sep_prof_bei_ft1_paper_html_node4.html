the nyquist frequency next up previous print clean next laying out a mesh up fourier transform previous ft as an invertible the nyquist frequency the highest frequency in equation 11 is almost this frequency is twice as high as the nyquist frequency the nyquist frequency is normally thought of as the highest possible frequency because for integer t plots as the double nyquist frequency function for integer t plots as so this frequency above the highest frequency is really zero frequency we need to recall that thus all the frequencies near the upper end of the range equation 11 are really small negative frequencies negative frequencies on the interval were moved to interval by the matrix form of fourier summation a picture of the fourier transform matrix is shown in figure 1 notice the nyquist frequency is the center row and center column of each matrix matrix figure 1 two different graphical means of showing the real and imaginary parts of the fourier transform matrix of size view burn build edit restore next up previous print clean next laying out a mesh up fourier transform previous ft as an invertible stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
