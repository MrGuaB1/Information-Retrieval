functional analysis technology development center sdstc logo stanford genome technology center technology development group functional analysis new sequencing technologies have both increased the rate of dna sequence production and decreased the cost because of this large amounts of new sequence are being generated providing a wealth of data to be mined for information classical methods of single gene expression analysis cannot begin to keep up with this flood of new data genome wide functional analysis is a burgeoning area of research focused on understanding global patterns of gene expression in an organism one of the projects using the microarrayer and scanner involves the arraying of ests or expressed sequence tags from the model plant arabidopsis thaliana in the pilot experiments 1500 separate dna samples are spotted onto glass slides with the microarrayer these spots are arrayed in less than a square centimeter the slides are then hybridized with fluorescently labeled cdna probes made from rna isolated from different plant tissues or from different stages of development differential gene expression of the entire array of samples can be assessed at once providing a powerful analytical tool for understanding regulatory networks involved in the life of an organism for detailed information on the instruments used in functional analysis view these pages arrayer scanner ologonucleotide synthesizer staff instruments & protocols automated sequencing system functional analysis software development stanford genome technology center technology development group 855 california avenue palo alto ca 94304 phone 650 812 2007 fax 650 812 1975 wwwadmin sequence stanford edu
