why do we use universal ut or gmt time because we would become confused if dates were given in their local time zones we decided to keep all dates in universal time that's using a time that starts at a particular location in england based on the old greenwich mean time most of the world has agreed to use the universal time or ut so all of the sid data are listed as having been taken at ut time or the time it would have been at greenwich when the data were collected for us 8 am in california is 16 00 ut what time is it for you where you are determine your time from ut time
