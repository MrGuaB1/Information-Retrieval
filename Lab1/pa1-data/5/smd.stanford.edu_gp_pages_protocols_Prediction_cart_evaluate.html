cart class prediction evaluate existing classifier cart class prediction evaluate existing classifier protocols to evaluate an existing classification and regression trees cart classifier run the cart module with the classifier model file and a test data set before you begin evaluating an existing classifier requires a cart model file that contains the cart classifier example file all_aml_train cart model a gene expression data set against which to test the classifier gct or res file that contains gene expression data example file all_aml_test gct cls file that identifies the class of each sample in the gene expression data example file all_aml_test cls learn more file formats step 1 cart to test a previously built cart classifier run the cart module specify the classifier cart model and the test data set the module creates a prediction results file pred odf that assesses the accuracy of the predictor open cart open cart with example data learn more cart step 2 view results to view the prediction results file pred odf use the predictionresultsviewer module the viewer lists each sample with its actual and predicted class open predictionresultsviewer open predictionresultsviewer with example data considerations the predictionresultsviewer provides an absolute error rate incorrect cases total cases and an roc error rate fraction of true positives versus the fraction of false positives use the roc error rate for comparing results across data sets learn more predictionresultsviewer
