tiniest two photon mems microscope performs brain imaging august 2009 page 1 print this article close tiniest two photon mems microscope performs brain imaging researchers at stanford university stanford ca have developed an incredibly small two photon microscope imager that uses a microelectromechanical systems mems laser scanning mirror to image v the brain of a mouse previously devised miniature endoscopes either used a double clad optical fiber to route fluorescence signals reflected off a mems mirror reducing robustness to light scatter in cases of deep tissue imaging or included only spatially filtered images neither method was shown to be capable of live imaging or of having sufficient sensitivity for fast physiological measurements alternatively the tiny two photon mems imager only 2.9 g in mass from stanford uses a hollow core bandgap fiber to deliver ultrashort pulses from a tunable ti sapphire laser to the microscope the light is collimated and reflects off the 1 1 mm mems scanner into an optical assembly comprised of four gradient index lenses and a dichroic microprism that is focused to the specimen the full aperture of emissions from the specimen in this case the neocortical capillaries and erythrocyte flow in the live brain of an anesthetized mouse passes back through the optics and into a polymer fiber to a photomultiplier tube for analysis illumination power was 27 mw at the sample eight frames acquired over 2 s at 4 hz were averaged to obtain the microvasculature images contact mark schnitzer at mschnitz stanford edu to access this article go to http www laserfocusworld com display_article 367020 12 none none nbrea tiniest two photon mems microscope performs brain imaging 2009 pennwell corporation tulsa ok all rights reserved tiniest two photon mems microscope performs brain imaging http www laserfocusworld com articles print html id 36702 1 of 1 8 13 09 1 36 pm
