snyder lab home page snyder lab research information on the many exciting projects in the snyder lab right now this site is in progress and the information is not up to date please be patient as these pages are slowly updated our laboratory uses global approaches to explore protein function and dissect regulatory networks several of our areas of research are 1 control of cell division and cell morphology in yeast 2 characterization of proteomes 3 analysis of regulatory circuits in yeast 4 characterization of the human genome we have constructed tiling arrays for large segments of the human genome and used these discover new coding regions and regulatory elements in the human genome by probing the arrays with liver and placental rnas we have discovered thousands of new transcribed segments in the human genomes using chip chip and these arrays we have mapped the binding sites of nf kappab creb and stat1 to discover new gene targets for each of these regulatory factors this information is being using to assemble gene regulatory networks for humans and is expected to help us dissect the complex regulation of human gene expression during development and in disease states 5 sex specific gene expression in mammals there are many other projects in the lab that don t fall under these broad areas updated by xiyan li email on 2011 03 16 11 15 am
