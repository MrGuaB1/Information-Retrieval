how light is detected polarized light detection in animals how light is detected for humans to see polarized light a special filter or dichroic crystal is needed however certain animals are able to see polarized light with only their eyes in all invertebrate and vertebrate animals there is the presence of the visual pigment rhodopsin in the photoreceptor membrane these rhodopsin molecules will absorb a maximum of linearly polarized light when the electric field vibrates in the direction of their dipole axis in humans and most other animals the molecules are all randomly oriented so the polarized light is not detected in insects and some other animals this is not the case we will review how this is achieved in an insect eye the compound eye of an insect is composed of thousands of units called ommatidia each of these units has a lens crystalline and several long visual cells in a star pattern the microvilli are the light sensitive parts of the visual cells containing rhodopsin the microvilli all point towards the center forming a light detecting waveguide called the rhabdom the sensitivity to polarized light results from the fact that the rhodopsin molecules are all aligned parallel to the axes of the microvilli tubes so every single visual cell will be able to detect light polarized parallel to its microvilli continue additional links polarized light detection in dragonflies
