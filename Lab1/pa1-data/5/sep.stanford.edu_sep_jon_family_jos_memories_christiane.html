christiane petite jos had a nickname of sorts for me in addition to the numerous endearments he bestowed on me and others men and women alike when he used my name he always called me miss petite i was realizing today that when i m not sharing fond and wacky memories of jos among friends who knew him i m sharing him with new friends and admirers in the making i am so fortunate to have known him although it is sad and difficult to be without jos and the delight he brought to us every time i think of him i have to smile every time he's here in those memories and smiles and i treasure them as a gift that he continues to give to me we definitely need to get out and have some adventures and in typical jos fashion even if he can t join us i know he's cheering us on the whole way click on the picture
