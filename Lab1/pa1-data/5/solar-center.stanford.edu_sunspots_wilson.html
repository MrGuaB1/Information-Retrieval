wilson's proof of sunspots how wilson proved those spots were on the sun text only what's another way to prove the sunspots are actually on the sun when you observed your sunspots did the sizes change as the spots neared the sun's limb ignoring for a moment that sunspot groups grow and shrink during their lifetimes what should happen to a sunspot group as it appears to near the edge of the disk remember again that the spots are actually traveling around on a huge ball as you look at a spot group straight on in the center of the disk the group may appear quite large but as the spot starts to travel around out of your view it will appear to become scrunched and get narrower as it goes around the limb of the sun and out of view a planet crossing in front of the sun's disk would not change shape or flatten is it approached the sun's limb in 1769 a scottish astronomer named wilson noticed this flattening effect of sunspots in fact by observing sunspots travel around the limb wilson could determine that the centers of sunspots were actually depressions in the sun's surface rather than mountains or high points can you visualize how the spot might appear to grow wider and narrower if not carefully watch the sun rotate back to are sunspots really on the sun solar center homepage activities ask a solar physicist about the sun glossary related sites solar oscillations investigation at stanford the solar and heliospheric observatory spacecraft soho sign our guest book comments credits copyrights this page is http solar center stanford edu sunspots galileo2 html last revised by dks on july 29 1997
