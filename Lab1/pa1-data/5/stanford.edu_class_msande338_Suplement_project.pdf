final projects page 1 ms&e338 reinforcement learning supplemental handout 1 feb 9 2012 final projects an important part of this course is a final project you have a lot of flexibility in choosing the nature of your final project but it should in some way relate to topics covered in the course a few flavor's of potential projects are survey you could read a few technical papers in a focussed area synthesizing and evaluating the research and think about what more should or can be done in that area for example a project could study the literature on reinforcement learning algorithms for linear quadratic stochastic control problems or could study the literature on reinforcement learning algorithms that try to learn what features of the state in a general mdp are important application you might consider an application area produce a simulator of a system and design a reinforcement learning algorithm for use in that context you might validate the approach through computational studies and or analysis as an example a project might consider how to efficiently learn good strategies for managing an inventory system with censored demand data theory you might focus on developing a theoretical result in reinforcement learning for example a project could study one of the algorithms covered in class that is proved to be efficient and establish stronger efficiency guarantees for the algorithm or an alternative algorithm a one page project proposal is due february 22 you can work on the project independently or with one team mate please make appointments with me and or hamid if you would like to run ideas by us or brainstorm as you think through topics over the next couple weeks there is no written report required but you must deliver oral presentations of your projects please reserve the afternoon of monday march 19 from 12pm 5pm for presentations or let me know asap if that date does not work for you we ll arrange to have lunch delivered
