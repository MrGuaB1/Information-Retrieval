stability of the difference equation previous up next print clean next application to 45 degree up the bulletproofing of muir previous stability of the differential stability of the difference equation the stability of the difference equation can be shown in a similar way but with some extra clutter first observe the identity 84 letting and equation 84 becomes 85 now replace the terms by equation 81 86 this equation establishes the result if the matrix is positive definite then is less than previous up next print clean next application to 45 degree up the bulletproofing of muir previous stability of the differential stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
