mksinc compute least squares optimal sinc interpolation coefficients mksinc compute least squares optimal sinc interpolation coefficients function prototype void mksinc float d int lsinc float sinc input d fractional distance to interpolation point 0.0 d 1.0 lsinc length of sinc approximation lsinc 2 0 and lsinc 20 output sinc array lsinc containing interpolation coefficients notes the coefficients are a least squares best approximation to the ideal sinc function for frequencies from zero up to a computed maximum frequency for a given interpolator length lsinc mksinc computes the maximum frequency fmax expressed as a fraction of the nyquist frequency using the following empirically derived relation from a western geophysical technical memorandum by ken larner fmax min 0.066 0.265 log lsinc 1.0 note that fmax increases as lsinc increases up to a maximum of 1.0 use the coefficients to interpolate a uniformly sampled function y i as follows lsinc 1 y i d sum sinc j y i j 1 lsinc 2 j 0 interpolation error is greatest for d 0.5 but for frequencies less than fmax the error should be less than 1.0 percent author dave hale colorado school of mines 06 02 89
