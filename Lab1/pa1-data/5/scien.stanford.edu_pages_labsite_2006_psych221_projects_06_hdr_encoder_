encoding hdr images for the brightside hdr display encoding hdr images for the brightside hdr display eino ville talvala psyc221 ee362 final project march 2006 introduction methods matlab port comparison encoding results conclusion references source code and data high dynamic range hdr display technology is becoming available in the marketplace and there are many interesting applications that such displays can be used for human visual system studies for example can leverage the increased brightness and contrast to better simulate real world scenes for research purposes and on the other end of the spectrum many movie post production studios want to be able to simulate movie theater level brightnesses for their work this project uses the engineering sample hdr display from brightside technology the brightside hdr display uses a dual modulator approach it has a large array of led illuminators covered by a standard lcd array each led can be individually controlled and the final image is a product of the backlight led light pattern and the lcd front panel modulation the led array has far fewer leds 759 in the prototype than there are pixels in the lcd 1280x1024 this means that the led array produces an image with a large dynamic range but low resolution and the lcd panel can modulate that image with a high frequency low dynamic range image a central concern with using the brightside display then is in splitting an input hdr image into these two components the led image and the lcd image in this project the encoding script provided by brighside was first converted to a matlab script and then enhanced with a convex optimizer to improve image accuracy in addition a matlab based simulation script was written which accepts as input an image generated by an encoding script and outputs the luminance image which represents the output from the hdr display this allows for quantitative measurement of the error resulting from the encoding process
