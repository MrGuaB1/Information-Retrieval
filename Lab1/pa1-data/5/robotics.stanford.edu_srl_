learning statistical models from relational data learning statistical models from relational data general aaai workshop summer 2000 pointers updcoming events papers software data contact information information mailing list researchers from a variety of backgrounds including machine learning statistics inductive logic programming databases and reasoning under uncertainty are beginning to develop techniques to learn statistical models from relational data this work diverges from traditional approaches in these fields that assume data instances are structurally identical and statistically independent or assume that relationships are deterministic new developments in this area are vital because of the growing interest in mining information in relational databases object oriented databases xml and other structured and semi structured formats this website focuses on techniques that operate directly on relational data to learn models that represent statistical correlations among the properties of related entities it grew out of a workshop at aaai 2000 specifically we focus on methods for learning statistical models from heterogeneous non independent samples non propositional data representations including relational and first order models efficient techniques for mining relational and semi structured data applications of relational data analysis eg web mining counter terrorism intrusion detection collaborative filtering bioinformatics version 3.0 updated 2000.09 26
