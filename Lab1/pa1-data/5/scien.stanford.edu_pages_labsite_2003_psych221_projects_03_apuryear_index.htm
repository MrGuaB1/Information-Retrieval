ee 359 project homepage psych 221 ee 362 project homepage andrew puryear apuryear stanford edu hi welcome to my psych 221 ee 362 project homepage the project title is a study of possible improvements in jpeg compression with applications in high compression and wireless transmission abstract this paper explores two possible improvements to the jpeg image compression standard the first proposed improvement the cola jpeg is aimed at mitigating the blockiness inherent in the jpeg compression scheme at high compression ratios using a constant overlap add window instead of a rectangular window this proposed improvement proved to offer no advantage over jpeg the second proposed improvement the jpega is aimed at coding the image so that it would be amenable to transmission over hostile wireless channels this proposed improvement provides a 4db gain over the jpeg standard for quality reception at the expense of increased complexity full paper check out the unabridged text here project presentation the presentation slides are here all matlab files all in pdf format einstein mat test image used as a benchmark in much of the project projectfigures m matlab file used to generate many of the figures presented in the text makeqtable m matlab file used to generate q matrices author b wandell jpegcompress m matlab file used the represent images in jpeg format with specific compression ratios author x zhang vcode m matlab file used to create some results in part ii compress_jpega m matlab file takes images and returns cola jpeg files allows for variable compression decompress_jpega m matlab file takes cola jpeg files and returns images drive m matlab file uses compress_jpega m and decompress_jpega m to display a cola jpeg image matrixexpand m matlab filed used to create matrices for mesh plots have a great day andrew
