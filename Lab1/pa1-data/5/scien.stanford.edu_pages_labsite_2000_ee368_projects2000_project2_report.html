handwritten numeral recognition using neural networks next next introduction handwritten numeral recognition using neural networks firas hamze ee368 stanford university 27 may 2000 abstract we explore a neural network approach to handwritten digit recognition a theoretical explanation of feed forward networks is presented several fully connected feed forward neural nets of varying size are trained on images obtained from the nist online database performance of the systems is analyzed and compared to that of principal component analysis which is also given a brief theoretical outline the best performing system was a 50 unit network which had a recognition error of 6.95 on the test data pca achieved a best error rate of 14 introduction the handwritten data set feed forward neural network method neural network principles simulation details and results principal component analysis pca pca principles simulation details and results conclusion references about this document firas hamze thu jun 1 01 31 26 pdt 2000
