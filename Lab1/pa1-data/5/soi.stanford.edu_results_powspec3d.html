solar 3d power spectrum solar 3d power spectrum summary of solar 3d power spectrum the power spectrum here represents p mode freqency oscillations of the sun the x and y axes are wave numbers which are calculated from the degree l of the spherical surface harmonic modes the z axis is the frequency of oscillation for solar oscillations the power is not evenly distributed in the k omega plane but instead corresponds to ridges each of these ridges corresponds to a fixed number of wave nodes in the radial direction the ridges are seen here as rays in the cut planes facing you the rings that you see cut out of the z axis plane are 3d representations of the p mode ridges six rings equal six modes eight rings equal eight p modes and so on the frequency value of the top of the z plane is the nyquist frequency the high frequency limit given by the time resolution of the signal which here is 8334 microhz the densest part of the ridge pattern is roughly 3000 microhz the frequency resolution is 5.71 microhz this data was acquired by the michelson doppler imager instrument on board the soho spacecraft in june 1996 data and guidance phil scherrer rick bogart jesper schou sasha kosovichev and tom duvall the 3d power spectrum data set was generated by rick bogart prepared by amara graps into this 3d representation and presented by rick bogart at the sounding solar and stellar interiors iau symposium no 181 nice france 30 september 3 october 1996 one slice through the frequency plane you can also download a postscript version of the above figure two slices through the frequency plane soho soi mdi results the soi main page last modified by amara graps soi on 07 january 1997
