native oxide growth w cleans growth of native oxide with cleans over time this little experiment was performed to determine how quickly native oxide forms on a silicon wafer 1 measure a new bare silicon wafer fresh from the box on the rudolph ellipsometer oxide thickness 15 a 2 run a new bare silicon wafer through a diffusion clean h2so4 h2o2 rinse 50 1 hf dip rinse hcl h2o2 h2o rinse spin dry oxide thickness measures 16 a 3 take the cleaned wafer from step 2 dip in 50 1 hf rinse blow dry measure immediately oxide thickness 5a 4 keep the wafer from step 3 in the fab enviroment and measure over time on the same ellipsometer data is available in linear or logarithmic form results courtesy of duncan stewart patricia beck and uli thumser back to top home sitemap search stanford nanofabrication facility webmaestro snf stanford edu last modified 08 28 2003
