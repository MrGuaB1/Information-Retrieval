sparselab non negative fourier example download code a non negative signal with bumps is created after a fourier transform and sampling the signal is recovered via soft iterative thresholding l1 reconstruction from the low frequencies recreates the originalsignal the plot below shows the original signal the fourier transform and the sampling on the top row the second row shows the inverse fourier transform and the reconstructed signal supported in part by nsf dms 05 05303 last updated 27 12 2005 by vcs
