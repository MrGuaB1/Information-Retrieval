inversion with convection cut inversion with convection cut inversion tomographic inversion by ag kosovichev was applied to infer the sound speed and velocity flows from the time distance maps generated by tl duvall in the figure below the top graphic is a vertical cut showing velocity and temperature variations below the solar surface derived by time distance travel helioseismology the arrows indicate the direction and magnitude of the flow the red and blue coloring indicates the variations of temperature with red being hotter and blue coller the bottom picture shows that the upper vertical cut is from a thin shell in the outer solar convection zone which encompasses the outer 30 of the sun you may download this figure as a postscript file this inversion was presented at the aas spd meeting in madison in june 1996 you can find more about this result from the the preprint 5.4 mb postscript titled time distance helioseismology with the mdi instrument initial results by tl duvall jr ag kosovichev ph scherrer rs bogart ri bush c deforest jt hoeksema j schou jlr saba td tarbell am title cj wolfson and pn milford soho soi mdi results the soi main page last modified by amara graps soi on 07 january 1997
