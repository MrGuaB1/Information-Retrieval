introduction introduction the world of digital camera's is growing at an incredible rate considering only ccd or cmos sensors with 2 million pixels or more there are more than 80 models of digital cameras currently on the market combined with the now widely available internet more people are turning to web printing services as an alternative to traditional film developing three of these web printing services are shutterfly com imagestation com associated with sony and ofoto com associated with kodak participation in each of these programs is facilitated by a free account activation after which one is able to upload digital images to the site whereas shutterfly com and ofoto com accept only jpeg format files imagestation com takes bmp and tif files as well the calibrated set of test images includes several matlab plots as well as several series of photographs which test different parameters of the web printing quality upon receipt of the returned photographs they were scanned and compared to the originals through a series of matlab scripts and visual evaluation abbreviation decoding for ease of reading the future sections i will explain the naming scheme for all the plots and labels any graph or label beginning with an o is a print from ofoto s is a print from shutterfly i is a print from imagestation especially in the matlab section the results will include many abbreviations hf high frequency lf low frequency lr linear ramp er exponential ramp hres high resolution pertains to resolution of original picture lres low resolution pertains to resolution of original picture combo or combination combination plot of hf lf lr and er the parameters i decided to test with each set of images is for here is a sample of all 4 matlab test images to test spatial frequency gamma correction series 1 images sunlight example frosted flakes to test illuminant correction series 2 images yellow background example macbeth color checker to test color matching background compensation
