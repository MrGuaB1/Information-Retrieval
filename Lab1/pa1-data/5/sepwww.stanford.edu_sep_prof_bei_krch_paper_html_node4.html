dipping reflector shifts next up previous print clean next hand migration up migration defined previous a dipping reflector dipping reflector shifts a little geometry gives simple expressions for the horizontal and vertical position errors on the zero offset section which are to be corrected by migration figure 2 defines the required quantities for a reflection event recorded at s corresponding to the reflectivity at r reflkine figure 2 geometry of the normal ray of length d and the vertical shaft of length z for a zero offset experiment above a dipping reflector view burn build edit restore the two way travel time for the event is related to the length d of the normal ray by 1 where v is the constant propagation velocity geometry of the triangle crs shows that the true depth of the reflector at r is given by 2 and the lateral shift between true position c and false position s is given by 3 it is conventional to rewrite equation 2 in terms of two way vertical traveltime 4 thus both the vertical shift and the horizontal shift are seen to vanish when the dip angle is zero next up previous print clean next hand migration up migration defined previous a dipping reflector stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
