nonuniqueness of the integration operator next up previous print clean next damped oscillation up causal integration filter previous symmetrical double integral nonuniqueness of the integration operator integration can be thought of as the implied division by zero at warns us that this filter is not quite normal for example appears to be an imaginary antisymmetric function of this implies that the time function is the real antisymmetric signum function namely the signum is not usually thought of as an integration operator but by adding a constant we have a step function and that is causal integration by subtracting a constant we have anticausal integration we can play games with the constant because it is at zero frequency that the definition contains zero division exercises show that the mean of the input of leaky is the mean of the output which demonstrates that the gain of the filter is unity at zero frequency next up previous print clean next damped oscillation up causal integration filter previous symmetrical double integral stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
