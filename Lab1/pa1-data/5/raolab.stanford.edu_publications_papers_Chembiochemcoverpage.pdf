cover picture detection of mrna in mammalian cells with a split ribozyme reporter chembiochem 6 2006 page 1 cover picture sumitaka hasegawa gayatri gowrishankar and jianghong rao the cover picture shows a split rna reporter strategy for detecting target mrna in mammalian cells a tetrahymena group i intron ribozyme reporter is split into two halves each of which carries a part of the coding sequence of the reporter mrna a fragment of the ribozyme and an antisense sequence complementary to a target mrna both halves bind with the target mrna and are assembled into an active complex that trans splices and produces a complete reporter mrna the reporter mrna is subsequently translated into the reporter enzyme which can be detected by fluorogenic substrates further details can be found in the article by j rao et al on p 925 ff
