polynomial division next up previous print clean next spectrum of a pole up damped oscillation previous narrow band filters polynomial division convolution with the coefficients b t of b z 1 a z is a narrow banded filtering operation if the pole is chosen very close to the unit circle the filter bandpass becomes very narrow and the coefficients of b z drop off very slowly a method exists of narrow band filtering that is much quicker than convolution with b t this is polynomial division by a z we have for the output y z 30 multiply both sides of 30 by a z 31 for definiteness let us suppose that the x t and y t vanish before t 0 now identify coefficients of successive powers of z to get 32 let n a be the highest power of z in a z the k th equation where k n a is 33 solving for y k we get 34 equation 34 may be used to solve for y k once are known thus the solution is recursive the value of n a is only 2 whereas n b is technically infinite and would in practice need to be approximated by a large value so the feedback operation 34 is much quicker than convolving with the filter b z 1 a z a program for the task is given below data lengths such as na in the program polydiv include coefficients of all n a powers of z as well as 1 z 0 so na n a 1 polynomial division feedback filter y z x z a z subroutine polydiv na aa nx xx ny yy integer na number of coefficients of denominator integer nx length of the input function integer ny length of the output function real aa na denominator recursive filter real xx nx input trace real yy ny output trace as long as input trace integer ia iy do iy 1 ny if iy nx yy iy xx iy else yy iy 0 do iy 1 na 1 lead in terms do ia 2 iy yy iy yy iy aa ia yy iy ia 1 yy iy yy iy aa 1 do iy na ny steady state do ia 2 na yy iy yy iy aa ia yy iy ia 1 yy iy yy iy aa 1 return end next up previous print clean next spectrum of a pole up damped oscillation previous narrow band filters stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
