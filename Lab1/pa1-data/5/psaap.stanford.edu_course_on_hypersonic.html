course on hypersonic entry and cruise vehicles vki lecture series course on hypersonic entry and cruise vehicles 30 june 3 july 2008 stanford university nasa ames research center in collaboration with the von karman institute for fluid dynamics sponsored by rto doe afosr & nasa introduction in depth knowledge of gas dynamics at hypersonic speeds is required to define the environment and requirements for the design and safe operation of space vehicles planetary probes and rockets the constitutive equations that describe conservation of mass momentum and energy in the hypersonic regime require the development of physical models for high enthalpy and non equilibrium effects in turn the development of these models requires reliable experimental data to guide and verify the models the hypersonic regime presents unique challenges for measurement techniques and flight tests the objectives of this course are to review the up to date physical models describing complex high enthalpy and turbulence effects measurement techniques for flight test and ground based experiments as well as numerical simulation strategies specific to the hypersonic regime the course is tailored to provide professionals and students working and or supporting aerospace industries space agencies and defense programs a snap shot of the state of the art in this rapidly progressing technology the directors of the course are prof p moin from stanford university dr nn mansour from nasa ames research center and prof o chazot from the von karman institute for fluid dynamics preliminary program monday june 30 2008 stanford university breakfast at 8 00 am coffee breaks at 11 30 am and 3 45 pm lunch at 1 00 pm 8 45 am introduction to the course dr nn mansour nasa ames research center usa 9 00 am irreversible thermo dynamics and non equilibrium effects in hypersonic flows dr d giordano european space research and technology centre esa the netherlands 10 15 am kinetic and transport theory of plasmas dr te magin stanford university usa 11 45 am kinetic mechanism for high enthalpy air flows dr a bourdon ecole centrale paris france 2 30 pm optical diagnostics and collisional radiative models prof co laux ecole centrale paris france 4 00 pm experimental and theoretical simulation of heterogeneous catalysis in aerothermochemistry prof vl kovalev moscow state university russia tuesday july 1 2008 stanford university breakfast at 8 00 am coffee breaks at 11 30 am and 3 45 pm lunch at 1 00 pm 9 00 am critical hypersonic aero thermodynamic phenomena mr rm cummings us air force academy usa 10 15 am flight experiments on air breathing propulsion hyshot prof r morgan university of queensland australia 11 45 am x 43a hypersonic vehicle technology development mr rt voland acent laboratories llc usa 2 30 pm experimental roles capabilities and contributions to aerothermodynamic problems of hypersonic flights and planetary entry dr b hollis nasa langley research center usa 4 00 pm direct simulation monte carlo for atmospheric entry prof i boyd university of michigan usa wednesday july 2 2008 nasa ames research center breakfast at 8 00 am coffee breaks at 11 00 am and 3 45 pm lunch at 12 30 pm 8 30 am roughness induced laminar turbulent transition prof sp schneider purdue university usa 9 45 am hypersonic boundary shear layer transition dr sa berry nasa langley research center usa 11 15 am turbulence modeling for reentry and shock dominated flows prof p moin & prof g iaccarino stanford university usa 1 30 pm tour of the nasa ames facilities group i 2 30 pm analysis and model validation of shock layer radiation in air dr d bose nasa ames research center usa 4 00 pm system design constraints trajectory aerothermal environment dr d prabhu nasa ames research center usa thursday july 3 2008 nasa ames research center breakfast at 8 00 am coffee breaks at 11 00 am and 3 45 pm lunch at 12 30 pm 8 30 am computational fluid dynamics simulations for atmospheric entry prof g candler university of minnesota usa 9 45 am high order numerical schemes for hypersonic flow simulations dr hc yee nasa ames research center usa 11 15 am a risk based approach for aerothermal tps analysis and testing dr m wright nasa ames research center usa 1 30 pm tour of the nasa ames facilities group ii 2 30 pm hypersonic stagnation point aerothermodynamics in plasmatron facilities prof o chazot von karman institute for fluid dynamics belgium 4 00 pm numerical approximation of boltzmann moment systems with levermore closure dr t barth nasa ames research center usa center for turbulence research building 500 stanford university 488 escondido mall stanford ca 94305 3035 phone 650 725 2077 fax 650 725 3525 email debmich stanford edu website http www stanford edu group ctr stanford university all rights reserved stanford ca 94305 650 723 2300 terms of use copyright complaints
