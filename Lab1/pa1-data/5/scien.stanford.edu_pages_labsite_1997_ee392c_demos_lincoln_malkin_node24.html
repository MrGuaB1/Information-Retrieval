parseval's theorem instead of triangle inequality next up previous contents next memory and computation problem up approaches previous performance parseval's theorem instead of triangle inequality the problem with the mlti is the number of comparisons which has to be performed at the level of 4x4 and 2x2 blocks we can use parseval's inequality to get a lower bound of the ssd possibly with fewer comparisons since the fourier transform places most of the energy from image in the lower frequency region see figure 4 we can compare only a few of the low frequency coefficients and get a good idea of the final ssd choosing eg p 4 or p 9 with a low frequency subset of the fourier coefficients will speed up and possibly improve the calculation of compared to the mlti approach figure 4 a 2d fft of a typical 16x16 block in an image apparently the mean of the block 0 0 is the most distinct but the other low frequencies are also important memory and computation problem bosse lincoln and michael malkin wed nov 26 14 36 45 pst 1997
