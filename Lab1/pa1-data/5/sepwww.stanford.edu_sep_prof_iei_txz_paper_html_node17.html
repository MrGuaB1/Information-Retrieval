retarded coordinates previous up next print clean next definition of independent variables up splitting and working in previous higher dimensionality retarded coordinates to examine running horses it may be best to jump on a horse likewise to examine moving waves it may be better to move along with them so to describe waves moving downward into the earth we might abandon x z coordinates in favor of moving x z coordinates where an alternative to the moving coordinate system is to define retarded coordinates where the classical example of retarded coordinates is solar time time seems to stand still on an airplane that moves westward at the speed of the sun the migration process resembles the simulation of wave propagation in either a moving coordinate frame or a retarded coordinate frame retarded coordinates are much more popular than moving coordinates here is the reason in solid earth geophysics velocity may depend on both x and z but the earth doesn t change with time t during our seismic observations in a moving coordinate system the velocity could depend on all three variables thus unnecessarily increasing the complexity of the calculations fourier transformation is a popular means of solving the wave equation but it loses most of its utility when the coefficients are nonconstant definition of independent variables definition of dependent variables the chain rule and the high frequency limit fourier transforms in retarded coordinates interpretation of the modulated pressure variable q einstein's special relativity theory previous up next print clean next definition of independent variables up splitting and working in previous higher dimensionality stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
