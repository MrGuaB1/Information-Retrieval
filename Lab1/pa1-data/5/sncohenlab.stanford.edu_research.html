stanley n cohen lab research research interests current research interests of the stan cohen lab certain of our investigations are aimed at elucidating the signals that govern rna decay we use e coli to investigate the mechanism of action of specific ribonucleases and related proteins and to identify cellular events and proteins that regulate ribonuclease actions we are also interested in the developmental aspects of rna stability and study mechanisms that lead to changes in decay during morphological and biochemical differentiation in the developmentally complex bacterial genus streptomyces our lab has long been interested in the mechanisms that lead to the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance and currently we continue to pursue these interests by investigating the biology underlying the ability of bacteria to adapt non mutationally to antibiotic exposure and other environmental stresses studies using dna microarrays are aimed directly at understanding genetic pathways that regulate antibiotic production and resistance some members of our lab use gene inactivation methods plus phenotypic selection approaches to investigate processes that perturb the growth of mammalian cells one of these inactivation methods rhko random homozygous knockout a genetic tool we developed to inactivate mammalian cell genes randomly and homozygously enables the identification of genes whose loss of function leads to altered growth properties the tsg101 gene which was the first gene we identified using rhko has now been found to affect endocytic processes as well as established pathways that regulate cell division and remains an important subject of study in our lab a small bioinformatics team within our research group has developed and implemented gabriel to aid our microarray analyses gabriel genetic analysis by rules incorporating expert logic is a novel system of computer programs that incorporates expert knowledge into rules and statistical algorithms used for analysis of genetic data example search keywords for pubmed rna decay rna binding proteins ribonucleases polyadenylation telomeres plasmids linear replicons dna partitioning rhko tumor suppressor cancer biology cell growth arrest cell senescence gene expression gabriel dna microarray bioinformatics tsg101 mdm2 2002 2010 stanford university last updated december 4 2008
