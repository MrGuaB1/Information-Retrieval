arastradero west back to runs click here for more pictures arastradero west 9 miles the arastradero west run is a scenic medium long run it has some slight inclines but generally is flat with one a hill in the middle along arastradero there is a dirt trail that runs parallel to the road this section of arastradero passes through the arastradero open space preserve which contains the hill and many other back trails depending which direction you want to go you ll either have to get to alpine or old page mill if you go in the old page mill direction head out on escondido and then turn right on stanford avenue turn left onto junipero serra at the light and then right at page mill stay to the right and get on old page mill following that until it intersects with page mill again run along the shoulder of page mill past 280 until you come to arastradero on the right turn on that and follow the bike path until a dirt trail appears on the left this is one of the trails in the preserve follow the path closest to the road going over hills until it finally dead ends at a dirt shoulder start running on arastradero again and take that until you get to alpine use alpine to go back to campus passing a baseball diamond a shopping center 280 and the back dish entrance eventually you will run into junipero which will lead you back to campus the run is actually not as complicated as it sounds once you ve seen it doing the run in the clockwise direction might be more favorable because more of the elevation come in short bursts the course run counter clockwise gives a long ascent which makes you feel out of shape because you don t realize that you are climbing note if it has been raining recently you might want to run on the road instead of the trails nothing can upset a good pace like mud going down junipero serra to page mill old page mill rd rarely a car in sight traveling down the scenic arastradero alpine towards campus
