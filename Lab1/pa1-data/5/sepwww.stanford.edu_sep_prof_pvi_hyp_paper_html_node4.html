rho filter next up previous print clean next geometry based decon up pixel precise velocity scanning previous smoothing in velocity rho filter notice the dark halo around the reconstruction in figure 3 it was suppressed in figure 5 by the subroutine halfdifa recall that slant stack inversion see iei for an example requires an filter without doing any formal analysis i guessed that the same filter would be helpful here because the dark halo has a strong spectral component at which would be extinguished by an filter the filter is sometimes called a rho filter because of the close relation of slant stack inversion to wave propagation and causality i found it appealing to factor into a causal part and an anticausal part i applied a causal after generating the t x space and an anticausal before making the space i implemented the causality by taking the square root of a fourier domain representation of causal differentiation namely i show this in subroutine halfdifa half order causal derivative ok to equiv xx yy subroutine halfdifa adj add n xx yy integer n2 i adj add n real omega xx n yy n complex cz cv 4096 n2 1 while n2 n n2 2 n2 if n2 4096 call erexit halfdif memory do i 1 n2 cv i 0 do i 1 n if adj 0 cv i xx i else cv i yy i call adjnull adj add xx n yy n call ftu 1 n2 cv do i 1 n2 omega i 1 2 3.14159265 n2 cz csqrt 1 cexp cmplx 0 omega if adj 0 cz conjg cz cv i cv i cz call ftu 1 n2 cv do i 1 n if adj 0 yy i yy i cv i else xx i xx i cv i return end notice also that vspray includes a scaling variable named scale i have not developed a theory for this scale factor but if you omit it amplitudes in the reconstructions will be far out of amplitude balance with the input next up previous print clean next geometry based decon up pixel precise velocity scanning previous smoothing in velocity stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
