solar sound speed variations solar sound speed variations solar sound speed variations this graphic from ag kosovichev shows the radial and latitudinal variations of the sound speed in the sun relative to a standard solar model red color corresponds to the positive variations hotter regions and blue color corresponds to negative variations cooler regions you can also download a postscript version of the above figure the relative differences between the squared sound speed in the sun and in a standard solar model are inferred from two months of mdi data in the next plot the horizontal bars show the spatial resolution and the vertical bars are the error estimates the reference solar model was model s of christensen dalsgaard et 1996 this model was a standard evolutionary model computed using the most recent information on nuclear reaction rates bahcall and pinsonneault 1995 and radiative opacity and the equation of state rogers and iglesias 1996 the gravitational settling and diffusion of helium and heavier elements were taken into account folliwing the theory by michaud and proffitt 1993 you can also download a postscript version of the above figure this sound speed was inferred using an inversion process starting with mdi reduced oscillation frequency data and the above described solar physics models and parameters you can find more about this result from the preprint 1.4 mb postscript titled internal structure and rotation of the sun first results from the mdi data by ag kosovichev j schou ph scherrer rs bogart ri bush jt hoeksema j aloise l bacon a burnette c deforest pm giles l leibrand r nigam m rubin k scott sd williams s basu j christensen dalsgaard w dappen ej rhodes jr tl duvall jr r howe jj thompson do gough t seikii j toomre td tarbell am title d mathur m morrison jlr saba cj wolfson i zayer and pn milford soho soi mdi results the soi main page last modified by amara graps soi on 21 august 1997
