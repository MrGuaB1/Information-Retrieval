frequency comb laser qwiki frequency comb laser from qwiki jump to navigation search introduction a frequency comb laser or optical frequency comb is essentially a well stabilized mode locked laser when the laser's spectrum can be made to span an optical octave measurements and hence stabilization of the absolute laser frequency are possible thus this device provides a very useful and practical tool whereby optical frequencies may be easily referenced to accurately known radio frequencies note that since the definition of the time unit second is based on an rf transition in cesium referencing an optical frequency to this standard is essentially the best one can hope for the frequency comb method thus provides a great advance relative to the frequency chain methods which were previously employed for optical frequency measurement basic operation starting with a mode locked laser additional information one half of the 2005 nobel prize in physics was shared by john l hall and theodore w hansch largely for their contributions to the advancement of laser spectroscopy and specifically for their development of the optical frequency comb technique retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php frequency_comb_laser categories concept laser systems lab lore views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 18 october 2010 at 18 22 this page has been accessed 30867 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
