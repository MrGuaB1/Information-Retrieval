snyder lab home page snyder lab research information on the many exciting projects in the snyder lab right now this site is in progress and the information is not up to date please be patient as these pages are slowly updated our laboratory uses global approaches to explore protein function and dissect regulatory networks several of our areas of research are 1 control of cell division and cell morphology in yeast 2 characterization of proteomes 3 analysis of regulatory circuits in yeast in collaboration with dr p brown stanford university we have developed a novel method called chip chip to identify all of the targets of transcription factors dna is prepared from chromatin that has been immunoprecipitated with antibodies to a specific transcription factor and is used to probe a microarray of intergenic region dna all regions of the genome that are bound by the transcription factor are then deduced we have been employing this methodology to dissect the transcriptional circuitry in yeast and understand how regulatory circuits evolve between related species 4 characterization of the human genome 5 sex specific gene expression in mammals there are many other projects in the lab that don t fall under these broad areas updated by xiyan li email on 2011 03 16 11 15 am
