stolt migration next up previous print clean next references up adjoint operators previous units stolt migration nmo is based on the quadratic equation v 2 t 2 z 2 x 2 as explained in iei stolt migration is based on the quadratic equation which is the dispersion relation of the scalar wave equation stolt migration is nmo in the fourier domain see iei denote the fourier transform operator by and the stolt operator by where 32 a property of matrix adjoints is we know the transpose of nmo and we know that the adjoint of fourier transformation is inverse fourier transformation so 33 we see then that the transpose to stolt modeling is stolt migration there are a few more details with stolt's jacobian next up previous print clean next references up adjoint operators previous units stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
