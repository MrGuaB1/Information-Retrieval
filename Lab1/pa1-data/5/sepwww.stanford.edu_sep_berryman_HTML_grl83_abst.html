abstract of evidence for correlation of ultrasonic attenuation and fluid permeability abstract of the the paper evidence for correlation of ultrasonic attenuation and fluid permeability in very low porosity water saturated rocks with bp bonner and rcy chin the measured amplitude a of ultrasonic pulses in intact and fractured samples of water saturated gabbro and granite is observed to decrease as the permeability kappa increases according to the proportionality a kappa 1 2 this relation is predicted by biot's theory of elastic waves in fluid saturated porous media and therefore suggests that biot's attenuation mechanism may play a significant role in low porosity materials at ultrasonic frequencies the evidence is not conclusive the limited data set studied here is also consistent with correlations of the form a kappa epsilon where 0.2 epsilon 0.6 nevertheless the observed correlations may still provide a means for monitoring changes in permeability of low porosity underground repositories of radioactive waste electronic copies of this paper are not available
