weighted voting class prediction classify unknown sample weighted voting class prediction classify unknown sample protocols to evaluate an existing weighted voting classifier run the weightedvoting module with the classifier model file and a data set containing the unknown samples before you begin classifying an unknown sample requires a model odf file that contains the weighted voting classifier example file all_aml_train preprocessed wv model odf a gene expression data set containing the unknown samples gct or res file that contains gene expression data example file all_aml_test gct cls file that identifies the class of each sample in the gene expression data as unknown example file all_aml_test_unknown cls learn more file formats step 1 weightedvoting to classify unknown samples using a previously built weighted voting classifier run the weightedvoting module use the model file parameter to specify the classifier model odf and the test filename and test class filename parameters to specify the data set containing the unknown samples the module creates a prediction results file pred odf that lists each sample with its actual class unknown and its predicted class open weightedvoting open weightedvoting with example data learn more weightedvoting step 2 view results to view the prediction results file pred odf use the predictionresultsviewer module the viewer lists each sample with its actual class unknown and its predicted class open predictionresultsviewer open predictionresultsviewer with example data considerations ignore the actual class which was unknown ignore the error rates which are designed to evaluate the class predictor against known data learn more predictionresultsviewer
