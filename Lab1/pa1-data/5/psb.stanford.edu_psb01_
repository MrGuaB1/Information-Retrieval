pacific symposium on biocomputing 2001 symposium banner this is the post event web site for psb 2001 information on the upcoming psb is now available the psb 2001 attendance list electronic proceedings submitted psb related links and other useful information can be found below pacific symposium on biocomputing 2001 the pacific symposium on biocomputing psb 2001 was an international multidisciplinary conference for the presentation and discussion of current research in the theory and application of computational methods in problems of biological significance papers and presentations were rigorously peer reviewed and were published in an archival proceedings volume psb 2001 was held january 3 7 2001 in hawaii at the the orchid at mauna lani on the big island of hawaii psb 2001 brought together top researchers from the us the asian pacific nations and around the world to exchange research results and address open issues in all aspects of computational biology psb is a forum for the presentation of work in databases algorithms interfaces visualization modeling and other computational methods as applied to biological problems with emphasis on applications in data rich areas of molecular biology the psb has been designed to be responsive to the need for critical mass in sub disciplines within biocomputing for that reason it is the only meeting whose sessions are defined dynamically each year in response to specific proposals psb sessions are organized by leaders in the emerging areas and targeted to provide a forum for publication and discussion of research in biocomputing's hot topics in this way psb provides an early forum for serious examination of emerging methods and approaches in this rapidly changing field in 2001 the psb sessions were human genome variation linking genotypes to clinical phenotypes natural language processing for biology term extraction information retrieval information extraction and corpus annotation genome pathway and interaction bioinformatics phylogenetics in the post genomic era high performance computing for computational biology disorder and flexibility in protein structure and function dna structure protein dna interactions and dna protein expression structures phylogenies and genomes the integrated study of protein evolution bioethics fiction science and the future of mankind psb 2001 tutorials psb 2001 offered the following tutorals data analysis tools for dna microarray data predictive methods using rna sequences genetic networks analysis the millennium opening version python for structural bioinformatics high performance technical computing information extraction from scientific texts in addition psb hosted a public meeting of the asia pacific bioinformatics network apbionet which was formed during psb 98 the list of registrants is available peer reviewed papers the core of the conference consists of rigorously peer reviewed full length papers reporting on original work the online proceedings contain 100 of the papers the complete set of peer reviewed papers is available as a bound proceedings volume and can be ordered from world scientific press see the original call for papers for more information keynote address david haussler of the university of california santa cruz gave the keynote lecture entitled a working draft of the human genome sponsors psb gratefully acknowledges the support of its sponsors we would like to offer a special thanks to the department of energy and the national library of medicine national institutes of health for their participation since the founding of the conference and for their commitment to travel support for psb 99 psb 2000 and psb2001 psb is also sponsored by partek compaq proteme sun microsystems roche biocarta 3rd millennium inc sgi and the nasa center for computational astrobiology and fundamental biology psb is affiliated with the international society for computational biology if you or your organization would like to be a sponsor of psb please contact the psb coordinator please visit our sponsors web sites and tell them you appreciate their support of psb previous psb meetings information about previous psb meetings including the full electronic proceedings is available see the 2001 psb meeting the 2000 psb meeting the 1999 psb meeting the 1998 psb meeting the 1997 psb meeting the 1996 psb meeting for more information psb conference coordinator kevin lauderdale psb coordinator section on medical informatics sumc msob x 215 stanford ca usa 94305 5479 telephone 650 725 0659 fax 650 725 7944 this page is no longer being updated this is the version of january 26 2001
