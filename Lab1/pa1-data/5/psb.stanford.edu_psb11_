pacific symposium on biocomputing 2011 this is the post event website for psb 2011 information on the upcoming psb is now available the psb 2011 conference materials and electronic proceedings are available please see below for more information pacific symposium on biocomputing 2011 the pacific symposium on biocomputing psb 2011 was an international multidisciplinary conference for the presentation and discussion of current research in the theory and application of computational methods in problems of biological significance papers and presentations were rigorously peer reviewed and were published in an archival proceedings volume psb 2011 was held january 3 7 2011 at the fairmont orchid big island of hawaii psb 2011 brought together top researchers from the us the asian pacific nations and around the world to exchange research results and address open issues in all aspects of computational biology psb is a forum for the presentation of work in databases algorithms interfaces visualization modeling and other computational methods as applied to biological problems with emphasis on applications in data rich areas of molecular biology the psb has been designed to be responsive to the need for critical mass in sub disciplines within biocomputing for that reason it is the only meeting whose sessions are defined dynamically each year in response to specific proposals psb sessions are organized by leaders in the emerging areas and targeted to provide a forum for publication and discussion of research in biocomputing's hot topics in this way psb provides an early forum for serious examination of emerging methods and approaches in this rapidly changing field psb 2011 sessions computational methods integrating diverse biological and clinical data for translational science genome wide association mapping and rare alleles from population genomics to personalized medicine microbiome studies understanding how the dominant form of life affects us multi scale modelling of biosystems from molecular to mesoscale personal genomics reverse engineering and synthesis of biomolecular systems session survey tutorials were offered on january 3 2011 psb 2011 workshops psb offered two three hour workshops on january 4 and a special workshop on january 7 the workshops were created to provide an opportunity for a gathering that will not be based on peer reviewed papers included in the proceedings book the workshops consisted of presentations by invited speakers abstract submissions for the workshops were evaluated by the workshop co chairs peer reviewed papers the core of the conference consists of rigorously peer reviewed full length papers reporting on original work keynote speakers vijay pande associate professor of chemistry stanford university gave a talk entitled folding home past present and future ellen wright clayton rosalind e franklin professor of genetics and health policy professor of law professor of pediatrics vanderbilt university gave a talk entitled surfing the tsunami of whole genome sequencing sponsors psb gratefully acknowledges the support of its sponsors we would like to offer a special thanks to the national library of medicine national institutes of health for their participation since the founding of the conference and for their commitment to travel support for psb 1999 psb 2000 psb 2001 psb 2002 psb 2003 psb 2004 psb 2005 psb 2006 psb 2007 psb 2008 psb 2009 psb 2010 and psb 2011 psb is affiliated with the international society for computational biology please visit our sponsors websites and let them know you appreciate their support of psb national library of medicine international society for computational biology stsi if you or your organization would like to be a sponsor of psb please email the psb coordinator at psb hawaii gmail com previous psb meetings information about previous psb meetings including the full electronic proceedings is available the 2010 psb meeting the 2009 psb meeting the 2008 psb meeting the 2007 psb meeting the 2006 psb meeting the 2005 psb meeting the 2004 psb meeting the 2003 psb meeting the 2002 psb meeting the 2001 psb meeting the 2000 psb meeting the 1999 psb meeting the 1998 psb meeting the 1997 psb meeting the 1996 psb meeting for more information tiffany murray psb coordinator department of bioengineering 318 campust drive s170 stanford ca usa 94305 5444 telephone 650 725 0659 fax 650 723 8544 email psb hawaii gmail com this page is no longer being updated last update january 24 2011
