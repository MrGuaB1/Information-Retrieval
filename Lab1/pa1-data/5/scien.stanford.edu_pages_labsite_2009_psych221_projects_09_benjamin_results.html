performance analysis of rgbw cfa main page performance analysis of rgbw cfa results overview introduction motivation test methodology results summary references results mtf50 noise aliasing results results of performance analysis on mtf50 noise and aliasing are summarized below mtf50 opponent images showed higher mtf50 than any other type except when w band got saturated at which time rgbw had better mtf50 for very low lighting conditions less than 15ms exposure time mtf was not useful for rgb and bayer because the image was too noisy to detect edges below is the region above 15ms exposure time noise opponent channel had the best noise figures under all lighting conditions aliasing again opponent channel had least aliasing aliasing for rgbw behaves erratically because of the non linearity involved in this method design by wolfgang modified by ben varkey benjamin xhtml 1.0 css 2.0
