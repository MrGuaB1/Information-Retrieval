measuring gaussian beams qwiki measuring gaussian beams from qwiki jump to navigation search the parameters for a gaussian beam can be determined from two measurements of the beam diameter separated by a known distance x in conjunction with the knowledge of whether the lies between or outside of the two measurements the only knowledge of gaussian beam propagation needed is the beam waist equation w 2 z is the beam diameter at z called w 1 from now on and z r is the raleigh range which we will solve for let z be the location of the first measurement and z x be the location of the second the second measurement is related to the raleigh range by solving the first equation for z 2 and then subtracting the first equation from the second and solving this for z r gives us a quadratic equation for z there are two solutions to the quadratic equation the plus sign gives the solution for the beam waist outside of the measurements and the minus is the solution when the waist is between the measurements in order for the measurements to be consistent with a real beam the radicand must be positive once z has been found we simply substitute this value back to find z r it is then straightforward to find any parameter of the beam matlab script getbeamparameters m retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php measuring_gaussian_beams category lab lore views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 31 august 2006 at 14 29 this page has been accessed 5700 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
