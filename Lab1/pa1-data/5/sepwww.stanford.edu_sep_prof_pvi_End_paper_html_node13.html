burg spectra next up previous print clean next references up the screen previous the seismic data plane burg spectra the burg spectral method is described in fgdp a theoretical description is not repeated in this book the main feature of the burg spectrum is its insensitivity to the edges of the data window of estimation in building the zplane program several interesting practical aspects arose first the program allows us to put a box on the data and the burg spectrum of the data in that box is computed and displayed thus the burg computation of the reflection coefficients is a ratio of a numerator to a denominator each of which is averaged in your selected box second some traditional literature suggests that the only parameter you choose with the burg spectrum is the filter length after experimenting a while i decided to keep the filter length at a constant 25 and instead let the variable be the corners of the estimation box that we draw on the data plane third i found it necessary to bias the reflection coefficients downward as the lag approaches the data length next up previous print clean next references up the screen previous the seismic data plane stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
