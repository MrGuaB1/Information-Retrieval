the stolt method of migration on most computers the stolt 1978 method of migration is the fastest one by a very wide margin page 1 the stolt method of migration on most computers the stolt 1978 method of migration is the fastest one by a very wide margin it's almost magic like other methods this migration method can be reversed making it into a modeling program the most serious drawback of the stolt method is that it does not handle depth variation in velocity although attempts to repair this deficit have been partially successful a single line sketch of the stolt method is this p x t p kx  p kx kz  2 v 2 k2 x p x z 1 the steps of the algorithm are 1 double fourier transform data from p t x 0 to p  kx 0 2 interpolate p onto a new mesh so that it is a function of kx and kz 3 scale p by the cosine cos  kz k2 z k2 x the cosine is the jacobian of the trans formation 4 inverse fourier transform to x z space the stolt method is sometimes described as normal moveout done in the fourier domain unfortunately unlike normal moveout it does not correctly describe a medium where the velocity depends on depth z
