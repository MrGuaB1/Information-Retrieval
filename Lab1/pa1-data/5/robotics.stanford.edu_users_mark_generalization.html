polypod generalizations generalizations to locomotion taxonomy this study on polypod locomotion enabled a general taxonomy of statically stable locomotion this taxonomy allows us to study locomotion in general and to generate and compare new and interesting gaits the evaluation and generation of these gaits are detailed in my thesis which is also a stanford computer science technical report thesis the cs tech report titled locomotion with a unit modular reconfigurable robot by mark yim has been assigned the number stan cs tr 95 1536 the stanford electronic library has several forms of the report in one directory they range from an ocr txt 299k version to a postscript ps 18m version they also have gif and tiff 400x400x1 images of each page 157 pages if you prefer related publications yim m a reconfigurable modular robot with many modes of locomotion proc of the jsme int conf on advanced mechatronics pp 283 288 tokyo japan 1993 yim m locomotion gaits with polypod video video proc of ieee int conf robotics and automation san diego 1994 winner of the best video award yim m new locomotion gaits proc of ieee int conf robotics and automation san diego 1994 in one invited talk on this work i was asked what is the research contribution i responded that the taxonomy of locomotion was the contribution the questionner then asked is that all i cannot stress enough the importance of a classification system in any new branch of science the first thing that must be done is the classification of the instances of subjects being studied this is the foundation upon which the whole area of study is built further ramblings back to polypod comments may be sent to mark yim at mark flamingo stanford edu last updated november 1996 though this represents work from 1994
