probability and convolution next up previous print clean next the central limit theorem up resolution and random signals previous speed of 2 d gaussian probability and convolution one way to obtain random integers from a known probability function is to write integers on slips of paper and place them in a hat draw one slip at a time after each drawing replace the slip in the hat the probability of drawing the integer i is given by the ratio a i of the number of slips containing the integer i divided by the total number of slips obviously the sum over i of a i must be unity another way to get random integers is to throw one of a pair of dice then all a i equal zero except the probability that the integer i will occur on the first drawing and the integer j will occur on the second drawing is a i a j if we draw two slips or throw a pair of dice then the probability that the sum of i and j equals k is the sum of all the possible ways this can happen 57 since this equation is a convolution we may look into the meaning of the z transform 58 in terms of z transforms the probability that i plus j equals k is simply the coefficient of z k in 59 the probability density of a sum of random numbers is the convolution of their probability density functions exercises a random number generator provides random integers 2 3 and 6 with probabilities p 2 1 2 p 3 1 3 and p 6 1 6 what is the probability that any given integer n is the sum of three of these random numbers hint leave the result in the form of coefficients of a complicated polynomial next up previous print clean next the central limit theorem up resolution and random signals previous speed of 2 d gaussian stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
