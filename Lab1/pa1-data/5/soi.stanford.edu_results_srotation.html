solar rotation rate solar rotation rate solar rotation rate this diagram shows the solar rotation rate inferred from two months of mdi medium l data as a function of radius at three latitudes 0 degrees 30 degrees and 60 degrees the medium l data are spatial averages of the full disk doppler velocity out to ninety percent of the sun's radius measured each minute this mdi observational program results in 23000 bins of approximately ten arcsecond resolution which in turn provides sensitivity to solar p mode frequency oscillations up to degree l 300 of the spherical surface harmonic modes you can also download a postscript version of the above figure you can find more about this result from the preprint 1.4 mb postscript titled internal structure and rotation of the sun first results from the mdi data by ag kosovichev j schou ph scherrer rs bogart ri bush jt hoeksema j aloise l bacon a burnette c deforest pm giles l leibrand r nigam m rubin k scott sd williams s basu j christensen dalsgaard w dappen rj rhodes jr tl duvall jr r howe jj thompson do gough t seikii j toomre td tarbell am title d mathur m morrison jlr saba cj wolfson i zayer and pn milford soho soi mdi results the soi main page last modified by amara graps soi on 07 january 1997
