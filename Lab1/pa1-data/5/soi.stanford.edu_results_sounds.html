solar sounds solar sounds these are solar sounds generated from 40 days of michelson doppler imager data and processed by a kosovichev the procedure he used for generating these sounds was the following he started with doppler velocity data averaged over the solar disk so that only modes of low angular degree l 0 1 2 remained subsequent processing removed the spacecraft motion effects instrument tuning and some spurious points then kosovichev filtered the data at about 3 mhz to select clean sound waves and not supergranulation and instrumental noise finally he interpolated over the missing data and scaled the data speeded it up a factor 42000 to bring it into the audible human hearing range khz one mode l 1 n 20 nu 2.94 3.0 mhz aiff format 1.5 mins 900 kb au format 1.5 mins 1.3 mb au format 0.5 mins 500 kb three modes l 0 n 21 l 1 n 20 l 2 n 20 nu 2.95 3.05 mhz aiff format 1.5 mins 900 kb au format 1.5 mins 1.3 mb au format 0.5 mins 500 kb all low degree modes l 0 1 2 and 3 aiff format 1.5 mins 900 kb au format 1.5 mins 700 kb au format 0.5 mins 500 kb go to soho soi mdi results the soi main page last modified by amara graps soi on 2 march 1997
