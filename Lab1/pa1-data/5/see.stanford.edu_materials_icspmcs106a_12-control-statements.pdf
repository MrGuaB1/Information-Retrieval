eric roberts page 1 mehran sahami handout 12 cs 106a october 5 2007 control statements based on a handout by eric roberts this handout offers some additional notes on java's control statements described more fully in chapter 4 of the textbook that emphasize the important concepts it also describes a programming problem making use of various control structures to write programs you need to understand control statements from two perspectives you must have a holistic sense of when to use them and why but you must also learn to understand the reductionistic details for this big picture perspective you can rely to a large extent on your experience from karel if you want to test a condition that requires an if statement in karel you need the if statement in java if you would use the while or for statement in karel you will presumably use the same statement form in java the other holistic point that is essential about control statements is that the control line is conceptually independent from the body thus if you see a construct like for int i 0 i 10 i++ control line statements body the statements in the body will be repeated for each of the values of i from 0 to 9 it doesn t matter at all what those statements are boolean data another important topic is that of the data type boolean which is the means by which java programs ask questions in karel the counterparts to boolean are the conditions such as frontisclear or beeperspresent in java the range of available conditions is much richer and involves the relational operators and the logical operators both covered on page 78 of textbook the most important lessons to take from these sections are watch out for confusing assignment with equality this feature of several programming languages including c c++ and java has probably caused more bugs than any other be careful to understand both the interpretation and the evaluation order of the logical operators && and or and not the time you put into making sure you understand boolean data now will pay for itself many times over when the programs get more complicated later in the quarter page 2 2 checkerboard problem create a graphicsprogram subclass that draws a checkerboard in the graphics window the number of rows and columns are given by the named constants nrows and ncolumns and the squares should be sized so that they fill the vertical space for example if nrows and ncolumns are both 8 running this program should produce the following output graphics library documentation the javadoc documentation for the acm libraries is available under the links section of the cs 106a home page also the methods in figure 1 will help with the assignment figure 1 some useful methods in acm graphics constructors new glabel string text or new glabel string text double x double y creates a new glabel object the second form sets its location as well new grect double x double y double width double height creates a new grect object the x and y parameters can be omitted and default to 0 new goval double x double y double width double height creates a new goval object the x and y parameters can be omitted and default to 0 new gline double x1 double y1 double x2 double y2 creates a new gline object connecting x1 y1 and x2 y2 methods common to all graphical object void setlocation double x double y sets the location of this object to the specified coordinates void move double dx double dy moves the object using the displacements dx and dy double getwidth returns the width of the object double getheight returns the height of the object void setcolor color c sets the color of the object methods available for grect and goval only void setfilled boolean fill sets whether this object is filled true means filled false means outlined boolean isfilled returns true if the object is filled void setfillcolor color c sets the color used to fill this object if the color is null filling uses the color of the object methods available for glabel only void setfont string fontname sets the font as described in chapter 5 double getascent returns the height above the baseline http jtf acm org javadoc student index html under the links section http jtf acm org javadoc student index html page 3 3 solution to the checkerboard problem file checkerboard java this program draws a checkerboard import acm graphics import acm program this class draws a checkerboard on the graphics window the size of the checkerboard is specified by the constants nrows and ncolumns and the checkboard fills the vertical space available public class checkerboard extends graphicsprogram number of rows private static final int nrows 8 number of columns private static final int ncolumns 8 runs the program public void run int sqsize getheight nrows for int i 0 i nrows i++ for int j 0 j ncolumns j++ int x j sqsize int y i sqsize grect sq new grect x y sqsize sqsize sq setfilled i j 2 0 add sq
