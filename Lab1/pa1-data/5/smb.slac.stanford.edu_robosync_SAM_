the stanford automated mounting system robotic sample handling newsgroup and information forum newsgroup about home an automated system for mounting and dismounting pre frozen crystals has been developed at the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory ssrl it is based on a small industrial robot and compact cylindrical cassettes each holding up to 96 crystals mounted on hampton research sample pins for easy shipping and storage the cassette fits inside several popular dry shippers and long term storage dewars a dispensing dewar holds up to three cassettes in liquid nitrogen adjacent to the beamline goniometer the robot uses a permanent magnet tool to extract samples from and insert samples into a cassette and a cryo tong tool to transfer them to and from the beamline goniometer the system is shown below as installed at a ssrl bl9 2 b nsrrc 13c1 and c the photon factory sbrc ar bl12 webpages with more information publications srn 18n2 28 35 2005 j appl cryst 35 720 726 2002 cassette loading tools the blu ice dcs control system ssrl sam user information directory video download ssrl smb hardware group ssrl sample cassette ssrl is funded by the department of energy office of basic energy sciences the macromolecular crystallography program is funded by the national institutes of health national center for research resources biomedical technology program and institute of general medical sciences and the department of energy office of biological and environmental research last modified thursday 09 mar 2006 11 12 51 pst
