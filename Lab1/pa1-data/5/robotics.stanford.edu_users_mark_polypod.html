polypod locomotion with a unit modular reconfigurable robot polypod polypod is a bi unit modular robot this means that the robot is built up of exactly two types of modules that are repeated many times this repetition makes manufacturing easier and cheaper dynamic reconfigurability allows the robot to be highly versatile reconfiguring itself to whatever shape best suits the current task to study this versatility locomotion was chosen as the class of tasks for examination this page presents work done in 1993 and 1994 work on the next generation called polybot started mid 1998 at parc as part of the modular robotics project under the smart matter theme locomotion includes nine images and five mpeg simulations and four quicktime videos of old demos of the physical robot showing some modes of locomotion with polypod this page resides at parc photos some inlined scanned photos 200k of the physical robot in different configurations up to 11 modules morphing example an example demonstration requiring reconfiguration an mpeg video is included generalization what can we learn from this we present a taxonomy some discussion and paper references awards click here for some rambling thoughts on polypod thanks for visiting 900k mpeg video comments may be sent to mark yim at mark flamingo stanford edu last updated august 1997
