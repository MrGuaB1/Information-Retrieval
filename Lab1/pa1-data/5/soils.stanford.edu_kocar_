home benjamin d kocar postdoctoral scholar soil and environmental biogeochemistry stanford university 2008 ph d stanford university soil and environmental biogeochemistry 2006 summer course in microbial diversity 2002 ms montana state university environmental chemistry 2000 bs montana state university soil science 2000 bs montana state university chemistry biochemistry education research interests my overarching research goal aims to examine molecular scale biogeochemical hydrologic processes and unify them with field scale observations to provide comprehensive descriptions major and trace element cycling within soils sediments and aquifers my past and current work inclusive of my ms ph d and post doctoral studies is comprised of several closely related foci including the examination of molecular scale abiotic and biotic bio geochemical processes governing the transformation cycling and fate of elements fe cr as u s field scale meters to kilometers measurements of metal and mettaloid cycling in natural sediments soils and geothermal environments and coupled biogeochemical physical controls on contaminant transformation mobility to address these research areas i have developed a cross disciplinary background in soil and environmental biogeochemistry mineralogy environmental microbiology and hydrogeology and utilize state of the art spectroscopic and microscopic techniques eg micro and bulk x ray absorption spectroscopy micro fluorescence x ray tomography and micro focused x ray fluorescence spectroscopy and reactive transport modeling to link molecular and field scale studies of element cycling
