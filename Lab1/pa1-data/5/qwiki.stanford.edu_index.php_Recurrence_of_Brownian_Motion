recurrence of brownian motion qwiki recurrence of brownian motion from qwiki jump to navigation search an interesting question to ask about a brownian motion process is whether or not it is recurrent the answer to this question tells us whether or not a brownian particle will re enter some arbitrary spherical region infinitely many times the transition probabilities for a brownian motion on are given by let's exploit the spherical symmetry of this probability about x 0 by defining so we may write in order to determine recurrence properties we must compute the probability that the particle lies within the sphere r  we may approximate this arbitrarily closely by where v n  is the volume of the n dimensional hypersphere of radius  by taking  to be very small now if we integrate p r  t r 0 0 over t we get integration courtesy of mathematica this tells us that 1 and 2 dimensional brownian motions are recurrent but 3 and higher dimensional brownian motions are transient retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php recurrence_of_brownian_motion categories concept probability views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 19 august 2005 at 21 09 this page has been accessed 3394 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
