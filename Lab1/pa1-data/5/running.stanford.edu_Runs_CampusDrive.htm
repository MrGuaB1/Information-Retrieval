campus drive back to runs campus drive 3.8 4.0 miles this is a nice and easy run that keeps you on campus there are some gradual inclines as you head towards lake lag at the south western part of campus but they are hardly noticeable usually there is a dirt path next to the paved sidewalks and bike paths that is easy on the knees
