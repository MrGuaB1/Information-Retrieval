srp javascript demo index srp javascript demo this demo uses a combination of javascript and java to demonstrate the mathematical steps behind the secure remote password protocol run the demo quick start instructions type the word password into the red client password field press tab and watch the status field at the bottom change to indicate successful authentication navigating the demo the demo is organized like a spreadsheet based on the values placed in certain input fields the values of intermediate and output fields are calculated changes in either primary input fields or intermediate fields are propagated to dependent fields once the change is made usually this happens when you tab out of the field or click somewhere else on the page fields in bold are primary user input fields the username defaults to user and the server's password defaults to password if the client's password is the same as the server's password then the protocol ensures that the client and server sessions keys s match up regardless of the values of the other inputs fields in italics are dependent fields their values are calculated from other fields so it is not recommended that they be changed manually doing so may make the values calculated by the demo inconsistent fields in plain text are automatic input fields in some cases like the n and g parameters these fields are normally picked from a predefined set of values in other cases the values of the fields are generated randomly although it is possible to enter values manually into these fields the values may be overwritten by other controls on the page the radix radio button controls the base used to display numeric values changing this setting does not alter the actual values of any fields the srp variant radio button selects the protocol in use this affects the value of k as well as the formula used to compute u browser requirements this demo requires a browser that supports both javascript and java it needs access to the java math biginteger class to do large number arithmetic some browsers eg netscape mozilla allow javascript code to create java objects directly through javascript while others eg internet explorer require the assistance of a small helper java applet to construct biginteger objects this requires that your browser support liveconnect a feature that allows applets to be called and controlled directly from javascript the srp javascript demo has been tested successfully under the following browser environments mozilla 1 x netscape 6 7 linux ns7 mozilla 1.1 macos x 1 ns7 windows 98 ns6 2 ns7 windows xp ns7 02 netscape 4 x jdk 1.1 5 w bignum support required linux ns4 78 solaris 8 sparc ns4 7 solaris 7 x86 ns4 51 aix 4.3 3 ns4 61 windowsnt 4.0 ns4 05 internet explorer windowsnt 4.0 ie4 windows 98 ie5 ie6 ms or sun jvm windows xp ie6 sun jvm 1.4 1_01 or _02 or ms jvm opera linux opera6 1 the srp javascript demo does not work with the following netscape 6 x macos 8.6 ns6 2 netscape 4 x macos 8.6 ns4 73 macos 9 ns4 7 no bignum support in java internet explorer solaris 8 ie5 no liveconnect macos 8.6 ie5 macos x 1 ie5 2 no liveconnect windows xp ie6 sun jvm 1.4 0_01 or _03 crash jvm upgrade needed see above opera macos x 1 opera 6.0 b2 crash w liveconnect solaris opera 5.0 b1 no java konqueror no liveconnect hotjava no javascript support omniweb if your browser and platform are not listed here it means that they have not yet been tested please let me know how well this demo works on your browser especially if it is an untested configuration to aid in testing use the following liveconnect test this test instantiates an applet and attempts to access it using javascript try the liveconnect test now if the test succeeds you will see an alert box with the message liveconnect test succeeded any other response indicates a failure a successful result means that it is likely your browser will work with the demo as is or can be made to work source code the source code for the demo itself consists of three files demo html the main javascript demo implementation sha1 js a pure javascript implementation of the sha 1 hash algorithm bigint java the source code to the helper applet use the save link as or save target as option in your browser to download and save these files
