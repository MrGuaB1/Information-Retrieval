good software criteria next up previous print clean next the laboratory notebook up a virtual laboratory previous a virtual laboratory good software criteria so what do i want from my software ease of use productivity and efficiency i want to prototype new ideas quickly if successful on a small example i want to apply the newly developed approach to large data sets mobility and portability i want to organize my research for future access by me and others i want to have access to my virtual laboratory wherever i am i want to run it on any machine i might come across furthermore easy things should be easy hard things can be hard mathematica and its book by wolfram are a great example on making simple things simple and difficult things possible i like to use any tool that helps me to get my work done but i shy away from tools that seem to make it difficult to switch to a superior tool if it becomes available similarly i shy away from tools that do not collaborate well with other tools i use for example a l a tex editor that does not allow me access to the standard underlying l a tex ascii text violates both criteria furthermore i like software tools that are widely used since they tend to be reliable so called pseudo standards and ease the exchange of information and data the masses are great at avoiding bad software but don t expect silver bullets in mass software furthermore new competing software will probably attempt to smoothen the transition for users of standard alternatives example for good standard software solutions to common tasks are l a tex for text typesetting gnu make makefile implementations or rcs for version control only if the software directly relates to my research area might i forego standard software for potential silver bullets next up previous print clean next the laboratory notebook up a virtual laboratory previous a virtual laboratory stanford exploration project 3 8 1999
