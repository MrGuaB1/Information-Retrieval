pacific symposium on biocomputing 2000 symposium banner this is the post event web site for psb 2000 information on psb 2001 is now available the psb 2000 attendance list electronic proceedings submitted psb related links and other useful information can be found below pacific symposium on biocomputing 2000 the pacific symposium on biocomputing psb 2000 was an international multidisciplinary conference for the presentation and discussion of current research in the theory and application of computational methods in problems of biological significance papers and presentations were rigorously peer reviewed and were published in an archival proceedings volume psb 2000 was held january 4 9 2000 in hawaii at the sheraton waikiki on the island of oahu psb 2000 brought together top researchers from the us the asian pacific nations and around the world to exchange research results and address open issues in all aspects of computational biology psb is a forum for the presentation of work in databases algorithms interfaces visualization modeling and other computational methods as applied to biological problems with emphasis on applications in data rich areas of molecular biology the psb has been designed to be responsive to the need for critical mass in sub disciplines within biocomputing for that reason it is the only meeting whose sessions are defined dynamically each year in response to specific proposals psb sessions are organized by leaders in the emerging areas and targeted to provide a forum for publication and discussion of research in biocomputing's hot topics in this way psb provides an early forum for serious examination of emerging methods and approaches in this rapidly changing field in 2000 the psb sessions were protein evolution and structural genomics protein structure prediction in biology and medicine molecules to maps tools for visualization and interaction in computational biology molecular network modeling and data analysis data mining and knowledge discovery in molecular databases identification of coordinated gene expression and regulatory sequences natural language processing in biology computer aided combinatorial chemistry & cheminformatics application of information theory in biology human genome variation analysis management and application of snp data in addition psb hosted a public meeting of the asia pacific bioinformatics network apbionet which was formed during psb 98 the list of registrants is available peer reviewed papers the core of the conference consists of rigorously peer reviewed full length papers reporting on original work the online proceedings contain 100 of the papers the complete set of peer reviewed papers is available as a bound proceedings volume and can be ordered from world scientific press see the original call for papers for more information keynote address wah chiu of baylor college of medicine gave the keynote lecture entitled protein fold determination of large macromolecular assembly from electron cryomicroscopy and sequence threading tutorials this year psb offered tutorials in the areas of many of the sessions each tutorial lasted three hours and was intended to provide the background necessary for non specialists to appreciate the session contents topics included in 2000 the psb tutorials were gene expression microarray design and analysis genetic networks analysis from the lab bench to computers and back determining protein structure from sequence using computational approaches python scripting good clean fun for bioinformaticians psb gratefully acknowledges the support of its sponsors we would like to offer a special thanks to the department of energy for their participation since the founding of the conference and for their commitment to support psb 99 psb2000 and psb 01 other sponsors include amgen partek compaq international society for computational biology merck silicon graphics zymogenetics please visit our sponsors web sites and tell them you appreciate their support of psb previous psb meetings information about previous psb meetings including the full electronic proceedings is available see the 1999 psb meeting the 1998 psb meeting the 1997 psb meeting the 1996 psb meeting for more information psb conference coordinator kevin lauderdale psb coordinator section on medical informatics sumc msob x 215 stanford ca usa 94305 5479 telephone 650 725 0659 fax 650 725 7944 this page is no longer being updated this is the version of january 27 2000
