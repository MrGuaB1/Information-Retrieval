calculation of tensor elements following data acquisition you calculate an adc map for each direction however these maps are not immediately the elements of the diffusion tensor in order to keep track of the different adc maps let's introduce the notation adc ijk to denote a diffusion map calculated from the data acquired along g x g y g z i j k for example adc 110 is the adc map measured with both g x and g y applied simultaneously the elements of the diffusion tensor on the other hand will be denoted by adc xx adc yy adc xy etc if only g x is applied then and so on if however more than one gradient is applied simultaneously then the expression will contain the off diagonal elements of the diffusion tensor the relationship between for example adc 110 and the elements of the tensor is given by consider the gradient scheme is the dual echo scheme commonly used g x g y g z 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 a listing of all six measured adc maps expressed in terms of the tensor elements is this can also be expressed in matrix form or more compressed where adc m is a vector of the measured elements and adc e is a vector of the diffusion tensor elements and m is the transformation matrix relating adc m and adc e the transformation matrix depends only on the diffusion directions that are applied the elements of the tensor is then calculated via the inverse relationship for a square matrix taking the inverse is straight forward for a non square matrix ie when more than 6 directions are applied the inverted matrix can be estimated by a least squares formalism go to the next step diagonalization
