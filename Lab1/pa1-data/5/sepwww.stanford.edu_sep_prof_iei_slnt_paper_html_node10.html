slant stack gathers are ellipses previous up next print clean next two layer model up slant stack previous slant stacking and linear slant stack gathers are ellipses a slant stack of a data gather yields a single trace characterized by the slant parameter p slant stacking at many p values yields a slant stack gather those with a strong mathematical physics background will note that slant stacking transforms travel time curves by the legendre transformation especially clear background reading is found in thermodynamics by hb callen wiley 1960 pp 90 95 let us see what happens to the familiar family of hyperbolas t 2 v 2 z j 2 x 2 when we slant stack it will be convenient to consider the circle and hyperbola equations in parametric form that is instead of t 2 v 2 x 2 z 2 we use and or take the equation for linear moveout 9 and eliminate t and x with the parametric equations 10 11 squaring gives the familiar ellipse equation 12 equation 12 is plotted in figure 6 for various reflector depths z j sstt figure 6 travel time curves for a data gather on a multilayer earth model of constant velocity before and after slant stacking view burn build edit restore previous up next print clean next two layer model up slant stack previous slant stacking and linear stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
