levinson recursion previous up next print clean next constrained filters up waveform applications of least previous design of multichannel filters levinson recursion the levinson recursion is a simplified method for solving normal equations it may be shown to be equivalent to a recurrence relation in orthogonal polynomial theory the simplification is levinson's method is possible because the matrix has actually only n different elements when a general matrix could have n 2 different elements levinson developed his recursion with single time series in mind the basic idea was presented in section 3.3 it is very little extra trouble to do the recursion for multiple time series let us begin with the prediction error normal equation with multiple time series unlike single time series the prediction problem is changed if time is reversed we may write both the forward and the backward prediction error normal equations as one equation in the form of 36 since end effects play an important role we will show how when given the solution for 3 term filters and 36 to find the solution and four term filters to 37 by forming a linear combination of and this can be done by choosing constant matrices and in 38 make by choosing and so that the bottom element on the right hand side of 38 vanishes that is make by choosing and so that the top element on the right hand side vanishes that is of course one will want to solve more than just the prediction error problem we will also want to go from 3 x 3 to 4 x 4 in the solution of the filter problem with arbitrary right hand side this is accomplished by choosing in the following construction 39 so that 39 previous up next print clean next constrained filters up waveform applications of least previous design of multichannel filters stanford exploration project 10 30 1997
