instantaneous envelope next up previous print clean next instantaneous frequency up hilbert transform previous the analytic signal instantaneous envelope the quadrature filter is often used to make the envelope of a signal the envelope signal can be defined by alternatively with the analytic signal g t u t iv t the squared envelope is a quick way to accomplish the phase shift operation is to use fourier transformation begin with and transform it to the frequency domain then multiply by the step function finally inverse transform to get g t u t iv t which is equivalent to envelope figure 4 left is a field profile middle is the unsmoothed envelope function right is the smoothed envelope the vertical axis is time and the horizontal axis is space independent time domain calculations are done at each point in space view burn build edit restore sinusoids have smooth envelope functions but that does not mean real seismograms do figure 4 gives an example of a field profile and unsmoothed and smoothed envelopes before smoothing the stepout alignment of the reflections is quite clear in the practical world alignment is considered to be a manifestation of phase an envelope should be a smooth function such as might be used to scale data without altering its phase hence the reason for smoothing the envelope if you are interested in wave propagation you might recognize the possibility of using analytic signals energy stored as potential energy is out of phase with kinetic energy so u t might represent scaled pressure while v t represents scaled velocity then is the instantaneous energy the scales are the square root of compressibility and the square root of density next up previous print clean next instantaneous frequency up hilbert transform previous the analytic signal stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
