risa h wechsler understanding the milky way understanding the cosmological context of the milky way and its neighbors galaxies in observed and simulated universes we see galaxies in the sky but cannot see the dark matter clumps surrounding them however we can simulate them as they form in a model universe in this video we show how good the agreement is between the observed distribution of galaxies in the sdss sky survey and the predicted distribution of model galaxies associated with dark matter halos in the bolshoi simulation it's hard to tell them apart statistics of satellite galaxies around milky way like hosts busha wechsler behroozi gerke klypin and primack 2011 apj in press arxiv 1011.6373 movie still image how typical are the satellites of the milky way we are interested in the cosmological context of the milky way is it a special galaxy in any way we found thousands of galaxies like it in the sdss sky survey and also thousands of matching halos in the bolshoi simulation and asked how many have neighbours like the magellanic clouds in both the real and simulated universes we find that roughly 5 of milky way like galaxies have 2 satellites like the magellanic clouds our galaxy is a bit unusual how common are the magellanic clouds liu gerke wechsler behroozi and busha 2011 apj 733 62 movie still image the formation of the milky way and its neighbors how did our galaxy form and and when did its neighbors arrive we found all the dark matter halos in the bolshoi simulation that had subhalos with speeds distances and masses that matched the magellanic clouds and then visualized one of them to show what the milky way's development may have been like the magellanic clouds likely arrived together recently the mass distribution and assembly of the milky way from the properties of the magellanic clouds busha marshall wechsler klypin and primack 2011 apj in press arxiv 1011.2203 movie still image press a strange menage a trois nature news and views just four percent of galaxies have neighbors like the milky way national science foundation study reveals milky way among oddball four percent slac news feature story irish weather news the milky way is a rare type of galaxy redorbit with video links how typical real and simulated formation history study compares the milky way to similar galaxies mother nature network credits this research was funded by the national science foundation and the department of energy and used computing resources at slac national accelerator laboratory and on the nasa advanced supercomputing pleiades computer at nasa ames research center
