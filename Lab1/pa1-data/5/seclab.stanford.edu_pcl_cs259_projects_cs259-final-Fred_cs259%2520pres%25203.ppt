enemy at the pynchon gates enemy at the pynchon gates fred wulff march 13 2007 quick review for the third time nym server distributed system previous vulnerability byzantine server today mostly sharing two vulnerabilities that i found while modeling the protocol pyngp 1.0 nym server collator client 1 2 3 4 5 dos attack tagging attempts even if it doesn t work you can still be a royal pain the ass the fundamental problem since the collator validator are the only ones that are trusted by being suitably untrustworthy we can force unbounded bandwidth usage so how do we do it first thought spam the bejeezus out of a nym what does it take initial paper suggests 100mb limit bucket why is this worse than normal spam even better casual mention of bittorrent dos the distribution cyclical force the distributor into a dilemma dos or you control who gets what even better do both larger sizes mean bittorrent step takes longer either everybody has to take more in which case you just got a supralinear dos attack you can analyze the traffic or the poor sap gets horribly dosed best of all suppose you overwhelm a mailbox choices sign up for another nym gives information away stop using the service probably gives you away directly keep on trucking useless bandwidth waste multiplier so that fancy pyngp 2.0 helps right nope it makes it worse validator is run by the same people as the collator doesn t alleviate the dos modeling simplified bittorrent resilience throughput larger pyngp structure n choose k server configs likelihood of flood getting picked up dos throughput
