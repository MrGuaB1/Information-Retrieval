litho processes polyimide resists polyimide process singe 30 minutes at 150c unless your wafers came out of a furnace or deposition system and are coated with resist within one hour prime coat the entire wafer with piq coupler 3 spin on the headway at 3000 rpm's for 120 to 180 seconds look for rainbow to fade bake in blue m oven for 60 minute ramp from 20c to 350c 30 minutes at 350c 60 minute ramp back to 20c polyimide coat polyimide may be spun up only on the headway coater there are chemical incompatibility problems for the other coaters spin at slow rpm's and slowly pour piq l 100 polyimide onto wafer starting at center and working out after wafer is covered spin at 3000 rpm's for 30 seconds to get a 2um thick film for thicker film slow spin speed and increas time optional during the spin hold a q tip by the wafer to catch the strings of polyimide so they don t hang on and wrap around the bottom some users do this but i recommend skipping it and keeping the door closed during the spin step poke out any bubbles in the polyimide place on a hot plate at 105c for 1 minute bake in blue m oven 30 minute ramp from 20c to150c 30 minutes at 150c 15 minute ramp to 200c 30 minutes at 200c 40 minute ramp to 350c 60 minutes at 350c 60 minute ramp to 50c lithography you could use az4620 to pattern the polyimide and etch in a drytek etcher some users pattern 2000a of aluminum and use that as a mask to etch the polyimide in the drytek drytek2 etch power 700w pressure 100 mtorr o2 flow 100 sccm etch rate 400a minute back to top previous page snf home processes page stanford nanofabrication facility last modified 08 29 2003
