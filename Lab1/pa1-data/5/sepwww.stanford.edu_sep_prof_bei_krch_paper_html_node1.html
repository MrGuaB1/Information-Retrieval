zero offset migration next up print clean next migration defined up table of contents zero offset migration in chapter we discussed methods of imaging horizontal reflectors and of estimating velocity v z from the offset dependence of seismic recordings in this chapter we turn our attention to imaging methods for dipping reflectors these imaging methods are usually referred to as migration techniques offset is a geometrical nuisance when reflectors have dip for this reason we develop migration methods here and in the next chapter for forming images from hypothetical zero offset seismic experiments although there is usually ample data recorded near zero offset we never record purely zero offset seismic data however when we consider offset and dip together in chapter we will encounter a widely used technique dip moveout that often converts finite offset data into a useful estimate of the equivalent zero offset data for this reason zero offset migration methods are widely used today in industrial practice furthermore the concepts of zero offset migration are the simplest starting point for approaching the complications of finite offset migration migration defined a dipping reflector dipping reflector shifts hand migration a powerful analogy limitations of the exploding reflector concept hyperbola programming tutorial kirchhoff code fast kirchhoff code kirchhoff artifacts sampling and aliasing kirchhoff migration of field data stratified v z fantasy migration velocity analysis fantasy next up print clean next migration defined up table of contents stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
