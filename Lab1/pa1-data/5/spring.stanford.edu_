spring surgical simulator project national biocomputation center welcome to the spring surgical simulator site what is spring spring is a real time soft tissue simulation platform for building and running surgical simulators to be used in medical education of surgeons the spring project is maintained by stanford university's summit group and the national biocomputation center at stanford university spring can be used for training surgeons building surgery skills surgical rehearsal an extensible open source platform for developing scenarios and simulations spring is especially intended for training in minimal access surgery in which indirect viewing and manipulation play key roles spring was developed by dr kevin montgomery of the national biocomputation center it is supported and maintained by stanford university's summit group under the haptic audio visual network for education and training havnet project open source spring news spring released on macintosh os x documentation update doxygen created view of spring visit the spring sourceforge project page for access to the latest released versions of spring code at this time we have releases for new macintosh os xspring application phantomserver omni window spring application phantomserver sun solaris spring application open source surgical simulation workshops spring and other open source simulation platforms were featured in two recent workshops attracting developers and surgeons who learned about the state of the art of simulation and freely available platforms for developing applications an open source framework workshop was held at mmvr 15 on february 8 2007 organized by the simulation open framework architecture sofa group of cimit on august 28 30 2006 summit hosted a hands on surgical simulator workshop at stanford university check out our recommended reading list for surgical simulation getting started with spring documentation click for the evolving spring documentation page which contains technical notes file format descriptions and other information to get started with spring new we have added doxygen created documentation of the spring application's code tree tutorials and examples the examples and tutorials here will help a user get started using the spring system modeling surgery spring employs 3 d models of deformable tissue that include spring based force computations model model the interactions of tools and simulated tissues presenting a 3 d world in which students can learn basic surgical skills in a virtual setting learn more spring models to learn more about 3 d data formats and how they are used in spring click here new who is looking at spring spring is being used in many locations in the world we use statcounter to track views of this website minimap of users click the map to see statistics on people recent access to spring's website pages spring architecture spring's architecture employs interacting application programs over local and wide area networks written in standard c++ and available on multiple operating systems spring's structure is described here other surgical simulation platforms check out these other options for medical simulation chai3d the open source haptics project at stanford university gipsi general physical simulation interface at case western university sofa simulation open framework architecture at cimit vrass virtual reality aided surgical simulation at kyoto university h3d open source haptics sponsored by sensegraphics there have been free counter with statistics visitors since 19 june 2006 last updated 11 april 2007
