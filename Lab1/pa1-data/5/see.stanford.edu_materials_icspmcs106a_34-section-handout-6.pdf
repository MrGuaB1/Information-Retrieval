h13 section 2 page 1 mehran sahami handout 34 cs 106a november 5 2007 section handout 6 more arrays and hashmaps portions of this handout by eric roberts 1 image processing chapter 11 exercise 12 page 458 write a method fliphorizontal that works similarly to the flipvertical method presented in the chapter except that it reverses the picture in the horizontal dimension thus if you had a gimage containing the image on the left of jan vermeer's the milkmaid c 1659 calling fliphorizontal on that image would return a new gimage as shown on the right 2 name counts write a program that asks the user for a list of names one per line until the user enters a blank line ie just hits return when asked for a name at that point the program should print out how many times each name in the list was entered you may find that using a hashmap to keep track of the information entered by user may greatly simplify this problem a sample run of this program is shown below
