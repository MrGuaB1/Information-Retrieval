powerpoint presentation motion based deblurring martin dibert march 17 2006 problem description original recorded blurred estimate of original outline restoration algorithms different types comparison restoring actual images results conclusion math behind the blurring a blurred image can be described in the following way where and in the frequency domain where otf is the optical transfer function recorded blurred image point spread blurring function original actual image noise math cont the restored image is generally described as where h x y is a filter restoration algorithms non iterative inverse fft filtering wiener filtering iterative lucy richardson method evaluation metrics delta snr difference in snr between restored and recorded blurred image mean square error visual inspection inverse filter wiener filter lucy richardson borrowed from presentation by ulrich and mattan march 2002 lucy richardson cont lucy richardson effect of increased number of iterations blurred 10 iterations 20 iterations 30 iterations 40 iterations 50 iterations 60 iterations 70 iterations 80 iterations 90 iterations 100 iterations 263 iterations lr metrics vs iterations lr metrics vs iterations algorithm comparison 0.0122 0.0204 0.1005 mse 1.16 0.27 8.01 delta snr db lr 10 iterations wiener inverse algorithm comparison cont original wiener lr restoring actual images blur estimation spectral blur estimation this is the cepstrum of the recorded image if noise can be neglected a large spike is present at a point that characterizes the blur length and angle blur estimation cont results conclusions lucy richardson method outperforms wiener and inverse filters wiener filter is simple to implement and does a reasonably good job inverse filter degrades image quality if noise is present spectral blur estimation is a viable method for estimating linear blur parameters correct estimation of blur parameters is crucial for reasonable restoration
