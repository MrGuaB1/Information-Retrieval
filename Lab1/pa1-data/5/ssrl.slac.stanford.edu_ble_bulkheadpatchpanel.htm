bulkhead patch panel ssrl beamline electronics standard motor lvdt bulkhead patch panel many beamline components have several axis of motion that are used to align and orient optics mirrors apertures crystals etc in the synchrotron radiation beam these motors often have an lvdt position indicator attached to the mechanics of the motion it is now standard practice to mount a bulkhead patch panel to a convenient location on the component support structure a motor extension cable is hardwired to the panel connector on one end and a 12 pin burndy gob14 92 pne connection on the other end the extension cable is run to the motor where it attaches to the motor connector the extension cable is permanent but the motor with its attached connector can be easily changed an lvdt extension c able is hardwired to the panel connector using an 8 pin burndy gob12 88 pne connector and is run to the lvdt end connector which is an gca 121 1000 the lvdt connector matches up to the extension cable directly the bulk head patch panel is made with enough clearance for fingers used in attaching the burndy connectors there is also enough room to place na me labels for each motor and lvdt the standard motor cable runs from the bulk head patch panel to the motor drivers return to beamline electronics index teresa troxel 22 feb 2003
