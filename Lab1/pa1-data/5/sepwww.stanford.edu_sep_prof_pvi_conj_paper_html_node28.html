unitary and pseudounitary transformation next up previous print clean next pseudounitary nmo with linear up unitary operators previous meaning of b b unitary and pseudounitary transformation a so called unitary transformation conserves energy in other words if then which requires imagine an application where the transformation seems as if it should not destroy information can we arrange it to conserve energy the conventional inversion 27 28 can be verified by direct substitution seeking a more symmetrical transformation between and than the one above we define 29 and the transformation pair 30 31 where we can easily verify that by direct substitution in practice it would often be found that is a satisfactory substitute for and further that the unitary property is often a significant advantage is the operator unitary it would not be unitary for nmo because equation 19 is not invertible remember that we lost x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 and x 5 in 17 is unitary however except for lost points so we call it pseudounitary a trip into and back from the space of a pseudounitary operator is like a pass through a bandpass filter something is lost the first time but no more is lost if we do it again thus but for any furthermore but in mathematics the operators and are called idempotent operators another example of an idempotent operator is that of subroutine advance 1 next up previous print clean next pseudounitary nmo with linear up unitary operators previous meaning of b b stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
