jos teaches english to ecuadorian automechanics students jos teaches english to ecuadorian automechanics students from the handwritten diary of jos the teacher for the sexto mecanico didn t show up on friday and as the students celebrated by making desk sculptures the school secretary invited me to test the resolve for my new profession by going in cold an opportunity i hesitantly accepted now my parents know that if there is any skill i was born with it is knowing how to handle myself in difficult situations being an unknown gringo stepping in to substitute teach a class full of greasemonkeys his same age is what i would call a difficult situation just as you ll never lose money underestimating the intelligence of the american public you ll never lose face underestimating the taste of an ecuadorean auto mechanic after a brief review of what's your name i switched the class theme to how to ask a gringa for a date i took two volunteers to the front of the class to be our subjects as there were no women in the class i asked the class opinion which of our subjects should be the woman needless to say this was a big hit for lowest common denominator humor you can always count on questioning a man's sexuality nevertheless i pumped the class for how to pick up a woman in spanish and we got the whole process down to four questions which i had our participants act out they were hello what's your name do you have a boyfriend would you like to go to the movies unfortunately the fourth question stumped them their first two attempts will you be my girl and would you like to have sex were both a teeny too direct so we all finally agreed on would you like to come back to my apartment for a coffee while i m sure i haven t spawned a new generation of latin lovers i hope at the very least that i taught those guys that english exists for other purposes than just a requirement of high school
