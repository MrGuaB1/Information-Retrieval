automated sequencing system technology development center sdstc logo stanford genome technology center technology development group automated sequencing system the massive amount of dna sequencing necessary for the completion of the human genome project and for the sequencing of other large genomes will require development of technology to increase sequencing throughput and to lower its cost our technology development group in collaboration with uc berkeley and affymetrix inc is developing a modular automated sequencing system with the goal of sequencing 1 mb day of assembled sequence at a cost of $0.01 per base the development of this system is the main thrust of our technology development and is well under way three of the five main instruments involved in this system have been developed and are in use these are the plaque picker shaker and m13 template preparation instrument together these instruments comprise the front end of the system and are in continuous use the thermal cycler sequencer and plasmid purification instruments are under development automated editing assembly sample tracking and quality control software and hardware are also being developed automated finishing of sequence including automated primer calling and synthesis is planned for development once the shotgun path of the system is in place staff instruments & protocols automated sequencing system functional analysis software development stanford genome technology center technology development group 855 california avenue palo alto ca 94304 phone 650 812 2007 fax 650 812 1975 wwwadmin sequence stanford edu
