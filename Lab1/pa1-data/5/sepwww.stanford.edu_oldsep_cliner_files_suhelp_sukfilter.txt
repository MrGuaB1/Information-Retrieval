sukfilter radially symmetric k domain sin 2 tapered polygonal filter sukfilter infile outfile optional parameters optional parameters k val1 val2 array of k filter wavenumbers amps a1 a2 array of k filter amplitudes d1 tr d1 or 1.0 sampling interval in first fast dimension d2 tr d1 or 1.0 sampling interval in second slow dimension defaults k 10 nyq 15 nyq 45 nyq 50 nyq amps 0 1 1 0 trapezoid like bandpass filter the nyquist wavenumbers nyq sqrt nyq1 2 nyq2 2 is computed internally notes the filter is assumed to be symmetric to yield real output because the data are assumed to be purely spatial ie non seismic the data are assumed to have trace id 30 corresponding to z x data the relation w 2 pi f is well known for frequency but there doesn t seem to be a commonly used letter corresponding to f for the spatial conjugate transform variables we use k1 and k2 for this more specifically we assume a phase i k1 x1 k2 x2 2 pi i k1 x1 k2 x2 and k1 k2 define our respective wavenumbers credits cwp john stockwell june 1997 trace header fields accessed ns d1 d2
