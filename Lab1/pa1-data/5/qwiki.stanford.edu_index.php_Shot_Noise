shot noise qwiki shot noise from qwiki jump to navigation search shot noise is a term describing the random fluctuations in a measurement signal due to the random arrival time of the signal carriers electron photon etc the process for an electrical current is first described then related to noise spectra and optical shot noise poisson process for electrons consider the electrical current i t associated with a fixed rate k of electron arrival at some measurement point the average current is given by where e is the electron charge if we assume that electron arrival events are uncorrelated from one another then the current will be described by a poisson process for a time interval  with n electron measurement events the average number of these events is then and the variance in n is since the process is poissonian it follows that the mean square value of the current is given by since we arrive immediately at noise spectra and filtering now we will derive the noise spectrum of the current s i f such that the rms current can be represented as for a white noise floor that is independent of frequency s i f s i we have where we have defined example filter responses windowing filter if we accept all frequencies only between f 1 and f 2 then we have trivially f f 2 f 1 exponential decay filter for an exponential decay response with time constant  we have single pole filter for a single pole filter with 3db frequency f c we have averaging filter the response function for averaging for a time  is given by this can be derived from the fourier transform of the windowed averaging filter shot noise spectrum now returning to the above shotnoise expression and using the fact that an averaging filter is used to give f 1 2 along with the definitions and we have and now we can use this expression independently of the averaging filter that was used in the derivation and apply any frequency filter converting to optical shot noise to derive the noise seen in a photodetector one simply has to use the conversion factor i rp where i is the electrical current as before p is the optical power is the responsivity of the detector and  is the quantum efficiency by which the detector converts a photon of energy into a current carrying charge e related concepts also see the photoelectric effect a condensed matter scattering theory approach to photon shot noise references robert boyd radiometry and the detection of optical radiation 1983 p 115 retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php shot_noise categories concept electronics views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 24 november 2006 at 12 39 this page has been accessed 27274 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
