plane wave superposition previous up next print clean next migration improves horizontal resolution up wide angle migration methods previous wide angle migration methods plane wave superposition one of the main ideas in fourier analysis is that an impulse function a delta function can be constructed by the superposition of sinusoids or complex exponentials in the study of time series this construction is used for the impulse response of a filter in the study of functions of space it is used to make a physical point source taking time and space together fourier components can be interpreted as monochromatic plane waves physical optics and with it reflection seismology becomes an extension to filter theory in this section we learn the mathematical form in fourier space of the huygens secondary source it is a two dimensional 2 d filter for spatial extrapolation of wavefields migration improves horizontal resolution rays and fronts waves in fourier space the input output relation travel time depth previous up next print clean next migration improves horizontal resolution up wide angle migration methods previous wide angle migration methods stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
