susort sort on any segy header keywords susort stdin stdout key1 key2 susort supports any number of secondary keys with either ascending the default or descending directions for each the default sort key is cdp note only the following types of input output are supported disk input any output pipe input disk output note if the the cwp_tmpdir environment variable is set use its value for the path else use tmpfile example to sort traces by cdp gather and within each gather by offset with both sorts in ascending order susort indata outdata cdp offset caveat in the case of pipe input a temporary file is made to hold the entire data set this temporary is either an actual disk file usually in tmp or in some implementations a memory buffer it is left to the user to be sensible about how big a file to pipe into susort relative to the user's computer credits sep einar stew cwp shuki jack caveats since the algorithm depends on sign reversal of the key value to obtain a descending sort the most significant figure may be lost for unsigned data types the old sep support for tape input was removed in version 1.16 version 1.15 is in the portability directory for those who may want to input su data stored on tape trace header fields modified tracl tracr
