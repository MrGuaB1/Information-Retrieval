non uniformities in colour balancing background information lens aberrations there are several ways by which lenses can distort an image firstly a lens can cause blurring a condition under which the light is not completely focused this is an effect that is wavelength dependent and is well known as chromatic aberration this is also an effect that can depend on the position of the light in the field of view figure 1 simple model used for a digital imager figure 2 wavelength dependent aberration in lenses chromatic aberration figure 3 position dependent aberration in lenses a aberration that is caused by lenses is photon reflection depending on the index of refraction of the lens not all of the incident light will be transmitted through the lens this is also an effect that is a function of the wavelength of the light this is because the index of refraction is wavelength dependent since the angle of incidence of incidence also matters this aberration is also position dependent the position of the light in the field of view figure 4 position dependent photon scattering of image sensors image sensors also exhibit wavelength dependent photon scattering not shown in figure in summary the lens aberrations discussed are categorized in the following table blurring photon loss wavelength dependent x x position dependent x x
