yohkoh hxt instrument hxt instrument the hxt is a hard x ray imager of the fourier synthesis type consisting of 64 modulation subcollimators each modulation subcollimator is equipped with a small nai tl scintillator and photomultiplier tube and measures a modulated photon count a set of the 64 photon counts transmitted from the satellite to the ground is converted into an image by an image synthesis procedure eg mem pixon and clean the main characteristics of hxt are summarized below i simultaneous imaging in four energy bands namely the l band 13.9 22.7 kev m1 band 22.7 32.7 kev m2 band 32.7 52.7 kev and h band 52.7 92.8 kev ii angular resolution of about 5 arcsec with a wide field of view covering the whole sun iii basic temporal resolution of 0.5 s iv high sensitivity with an effective area of about 60 cm2 for more detail see kosugi et al solar phys 136 17 36 1991 the spectral response of the hxt instrument is summarized in a table and figures below table 1 spectral response figure 1 effective filter characteristics figure 2 energy resolution figure 3 probability of photon detection figure 4 contribution of incident photons kev figure 5 count ratio vs incident photon spectrum power law spectrum figure 6 count ratio vs incident photon spectrum thermal spectrum go back to the yohkoh hxt top page
