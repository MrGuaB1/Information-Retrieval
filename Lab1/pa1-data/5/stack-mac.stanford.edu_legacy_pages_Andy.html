andrew murphy andrew j murphy graduate student ajmurphy at stanforddotedu born in 1975 usa graduated from oberlin college oberlin oh in 1998 start at stanford in fall 2000 interests in the stacklab heterogeneous and homogeneous oxidation catalysts in general my research is pursuing efficient manganese and iron catalytic systems for oxygen transfer to alkanes and alkenes my goals are to discover catalysts that meet the following criteria 1 are relative simple and inexpensive to synthesize 2 are operationally easy to use 3 provide high turnover numbers and frequency 4 show high selectivity for desired products my systems are ultimately inspired by metalloenzyme systems but are not constrained by any specific enzyme site or reactivity we believe that bi and tetra dentate nitrogen ligands which bind in a cis fashion can provide highly reactive catalysts similar to non heme enzymes heterogenous systems are being developed in parallel with homogenous systems in the hopes of enhancing reactivity and catalyst stability publications 6 discovery and optimization of rapid manganese catalysts for the epoxidation of terminal olefins murphy a stack tdp j mol catal a 2006 251 1 2 78 88 5 ligand and ph influence on manganese mediated peracetic acid epoxidation of terminal olefins murphy aj pace a stack tdp org lett 2004 6 18 3119 3122 4 simple iron catalyst for terminal alkene epoxidation dubois g murphy aj stack tdp org lett 2003 5 14 2469 2472 3 efficient epoxidation of electron deficient olefins with a cationic manganese complex murphy aj dubois g stack tdp j am chem soc 2003 125 18 5250 5251 2 remarkable affinity and selectivity for cs and uranyl uo 2 2 binding to the manganese site of the apo water oxidation complex of photosystem ii ananyev gm murphy a abe y dismukes gc biochemistry 1999 38 22 7200 7209 1 inorganic mutants of the water oxidation complex of photosystem ii abe y ananyev gm murphy a zaltsman l mincer j dismukes gc j inorg biochem 1999 74 1 4 114 114
