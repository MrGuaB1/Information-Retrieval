estimating the inverse gradient next up previous print clean next discontinuity in the solution up vesuvius phase unwrapping previous digression curl grad as estimating the inverse gradient to optimize the fitting goal 74 module unwrap uses the conjugate direction method like the modules cgmeth and invstack unwrapinverse 2 d gradient an open question is whether the required number of iterations is reasonable or whether we would need to uncover a preconditioner or more rapid solution method i adjusted the frame size by the amount of smoothing in figure so that i would get the solution in about ten seconds with 400 iterations results are shown in figure veshigh90 figure 5 estimated altitude view burn build edit restore to summarize the input is the phase map figure and the output is the altitude map in figure oddly the input looks maybe nicer than the output because it already looks something like a contour plot so if we have a beauty contest then the input beats the output but if you need to have the normalized altitude h x y not the phase of e ih x y then you need to solve the least squares problem next up previous print clean next discontinuity in the solution up vesuvius phase unwrapping previous digression curl grad as stanford exploration project 4 27 2004
