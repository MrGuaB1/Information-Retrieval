flores simbios back to people samuel flores i am a distinguished fellow in russ altman's lab working on rna dynamics rna's are a large class of macromolecules which play a pervasive but very incompletely understood role in gene regulation i am using the simbody software library to predict their structure and motions simbody lets us represent molecules using a internal coordinates and further lets us apply constraints to any of the degrees of freedom this will allow us to focus computer power in the regions of greatest interest allowing us to answer biological questions previously beyond our reach i have an undergraduate degree in mechanical and electrical engineering from the technological institute of monterrey in monterrey mexico after graduation i became an engineer and applied mathematician in the defense industry and rounded off my physics training with coursework at mit i recently completed a phd in physics in mark gerstein's lab at yale university where i developed new servers to predict protein flexibility and motion hosted on http molmovdb org e mail scflores stanford edu feedback collaborations career resources administration contact
