coherency next up previous print clean next about this document up crosscorrelation and coherency previous correlation coherency the concept of coherency in time series analysis is analogous to correlation taking x t and y t to be time series we find that they may have a mutual relationship which could depend on time delay scaling or even filtering for example perhaps y z f z x z n z where f z is a filter and n t is unrelated noise the generalization of the correlation concept is to define coherency by 34 correlation is a real scalar coherency is a complex function of frequency it expresses the frequency dependence of correlation in forming an estimate of coherency it is always essential to simulate ensemble averaging note that if the ensemble averaging were to be omitted the coherency squared calculation would give 35 which states that the coherency squared is unity independent of the data because correlation scatters away from zero we find that coherency squared is biased away from zero next up previous print clean next about this document up crosscorrelation and coherency previous correlation stanford exploration project 3 1 2001
