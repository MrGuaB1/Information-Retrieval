materials contamination sources contamination common types and sources there are three major types of contamination risks commonly encountered at snf for an excellent overview about contamination in an ic lab click here for prof krishna saraswat's excellent presentation pdf file format in brief 1 heavy metal and alkali metal ions sodium potassium gold and other non standard metals and alkaline metals are highly mobile ions in silicon and thus pose serious device issues with respect to breakdown oxide quality carrier mobility and threshold shifts extremely minute quantities will affect device performance please control contact of your wafers with any potentially contaminating sources equipment tweezers skin by following the materials and general lab policies at snf 2 photoresist photoresist poses some extreme contamination risks particularly for high temperature processing tools such as furnaces resist is primarily organic materials which will turn to ash and carbon even after extensive hard baking resist will still contain significant levels of solvent and other volatiles which can outgas and thus contaminate some high vacuum systems residual photoresist from incomplete cleaning also poses contamination risks recommended clean procedures will vary depending on the processing the wafer has undergone for example high energy processes such as implantation or plasma etching will harden photoresist please be scrupulously careful about wafer cleaning and ensuring the process flow does not expose sensitive equipment to photoresist 3 particulate particles introduce not only chemical contamination risks but also physically interfere with pattern definition at any point in the process eg micromasking incomplete etch bad film deposition please be conscientious in your personal cleanroom habits by following the snf policies back to top home sitemap search stanford nanofabrication facility webmaestro snf stanford edu last modified 09 03 2003
