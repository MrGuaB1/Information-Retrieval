gaussian signals versus sparse signals next up previous print clean next random numbers into a up synthetic data from filtered previous synthetic data from filtered gaussian signals versus sparse signals most theoretical work is based on random numbers from a gaussian probability function the basic theoretical model is that at every time point a gaussian random number is produced in real life we do observe such signals but we also observe signals with less frequent noise bursts such signals called sparse signals or bursty signals can be modeled in many ways two of which are 1 that many points can have zero value or a value that is smaller than expected from a gaussian and 2 that the gaussian probability function describes the many smaller values but some larger values also occur from time to time it turns out that the gaussian probability function generates more cryptic signals than any other probability function it also turns out that theory is best developed for the gaussian case thus gaussian theory which is the most pessimistic tends to be applied to both gaussian and sparser data sparse signals derive from diverse models and usually there is not enough information to establish a convincing model in practical work non gaussian generally means sparser than gaussian figure 4 illustrates random signals from a gaussian probability function and a sparser signal made by cubing the random numbers that emerge from a gaussian random number generator spikes figure 4 left are random numbers from a gaussian probability function the random numbers are connected by lines right the random numbers are cubed making a signal in which large spikes are sparser view burn build edit restore next up previous print clean next random numbers into a up synthetic data from filtered previous synthetic data from filtered stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
