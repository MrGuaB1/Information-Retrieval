knn class prediction classify unknown sample knn class prediction classify unknown sample protocols to evaluate an existing k nearest neighbors knn classifier run the knn module with the classifier model file and a data set containing the unknown samples before you begin classifying an unknown sample requires a knn model file that contains the knn classifier example file all_aml_train preprocessed knn model odf a gene expression data set containing the unknown samples gct or res file that contains gene expression data example file all_aml_test gct cls file that identifies the class of each sample in the gene expression data as unknown example file all_aml_test_unknown cls learn more file formats step 1 knn to classify unknown samples using a previously built knn classifier run the knn module use the model file parameter to specify the classifier knn model and the test filename and test class filename parameters to specify the data set containing the unknown samples the module creates a prediction results file pred odf that lists each sample with its actual class unknown and its predicted class open knn open knn with example data learn more knn step 2 view results to view the prediction results file pred odf use the predictionresultsviewer module the viewer lists each sample with its actual class unknown and its predicted class open predictionresultsviewer open predictionresultsviewer with example data considerations ignore the actual class which was unknown ignore the error rates which are designed to evaluate the class predictor against known data learn more predictionresultsviewer
