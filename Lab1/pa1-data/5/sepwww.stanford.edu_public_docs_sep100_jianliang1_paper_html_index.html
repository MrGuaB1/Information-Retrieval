qian & symes adaptive eikonal solver next up print clean next introduction up table of contents an adaptive finite difference method for traveltime and amplitude jianliang qian and william w symes abstract the eikonal equation with point source is difficult to solve with high order accuracy because of the singularity of the solution at the source all the formally high order schemes turn out to be first order accurate without special treatment of this singularity adaptive upwind finite difference methods based on high order eno essentially nonoscillatory runge kutta difference schemes for the paraxial eikonal equation overcome this difficulty the method controls error by automatic grid refinement and coarsening based on an a posteriori error estimation it achieves prescribed accuracy at far lower cost than fixed grid methods reliable auxiliary quantities such as take off angle and geometrical spreading factor are by products introduction paraxial eikonal equation the advection equation for take off angle eno and weno for eikonal equations weno for advection equations adaptive grid method and its implementation numerical experiments conclusions acknowledgements references about this document next up print clean next introduction up table of contents stanford exploration project 4 20 1999
