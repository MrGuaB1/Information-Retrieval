math 249b hecke and artin l functions page 1 math 249b hecke and artin l functions the story so far last quarter we covered adeles basic group cohomology including nonabelian h 1 and the theory of central simple algebras and started class eld theory without getting very far into the proofs we saw that the basic facts of class eld theory can be expressed as either statements about decomposition of primes in abelian exten sions or as statements about central simple algebras for example the quadratic reciprocity law can be interpreted as gauss a rule for the decomposition of primes in quadratic extensions or hilbert hasse as the statement that a quaternion algebra over a global eld is rami ed at an even number of places the statements of class eld theory also have cohomological interpretations which we discussed the theorem of hasse brauer noether in weil's basic number theory the proofs of the theorems of class eld theory are based on the following theorem of hasse brauer noether a central simple algebra over a number eld splits ie is a matrix ring if and only if it splits at every place as we explained and will explain again this is an auto morphic analog of hilbert's theorem 90 course objectives we will discuss two theories of l functions hecke and artin l functions we will begin by proving the functional equations of hecke l functions fol lowing tate's thesis then indicate brie y one lecture maximum how the functional equations for artin l functions are proved then we will return to the proofs for class eld theory we will follow weil in proving the theorem of hasse brauer noether using a generalization of the theory of hecke l functions and tate's thesis namely as a conse quence of computing the zeta function of a division algebra then we will prove the main results of class eld theory we will nish by showing how the construction of the weil group closely related to the central simple algebras encompasses class eld theory and gives a common generalization of the theories of hecke and artin l functions thus unifying the two theories the class will meet in 381t from 9 10 am monday wednesday and friday the course web page is at http sporadic stanford edu bump math249 html daniel bump 1
