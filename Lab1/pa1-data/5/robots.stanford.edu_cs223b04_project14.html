stanford university cs 223 b introduction to computer vision stanford university cs 223 b introduction to computer vision sebastian thrun and gary bradski project p14 blood vessel segmentation in retinal images project goal retinal blood vessels are extremely important in many opthamalogical images in some cases they are of interest in and of themselves in other cases they simply obstruct the real visual target and must be ignored in any case accurate identification and segmentation of these structures is a very useful primitive figure 1 example retinal image proper segmentation of blood vessels is also required for retinal image registration a necessary first step for image guided ocular surgery the goal of this project is to come up with a fast and robust scheme to perform segmentation of blood vessels from retinal images project scope this project involves interfacing with the image guidance laboratories of stanford's department of neurosurgery the final product will be a blood vessel detector that should perform reasonably on even the most challenging retinal images if there is time and interest we could also try and make it work on mammography images x ray images of the breast another even more challenging domain where blood vessel detection is important tasks the project will be accomplished through the following tasks task 1 gain access to retinal image data from stanford and from the web task 2 devise a fast and robust algorithm for the segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images task 3 devise a way to validate your algorithm's results extension test your algorithm on mammography images project status jennifer o meara teresa miller and paul echevarria point of contact daniel russakoff midterm report submitted final report submitted cs 223b introduction to computer vision stanford university course overview announcements time and location course materials schedule instructors assignments projects policies links
