converting slides and negatives to gif's here's the best way i ve found so far to convert slides and negatives to www usable digital images get them digitized onto a photo cd to a sun workstation photo cds look just like standard ibm pc cdroms in a subdirectory images you ll find a bunch of pcd files imgnnn pcd each contains one image at 5 resolutions the highest being 2048x3072 which seems to capture about all the information there is on a slide for films asa 200 and higher the middle resolution is probably the one you ll mostly use for internet use convert the photo cd files to gif or jpeg the more expensive commercial packages will usually support photo cd format although corel draw 5.0 crashed whenever i tried to get it to read my photo cd if you re cheap and know unix then you can instead download and compile the package imagemagick which is free that's what i did it also supports arbitrary rotations which can be useful if you don t always hold the camera level i found xv useful for cropping images interactively but keep in mind it won t preserve more resolution than will fit on your screen it also won t preserve more than 256 colors for large or full color images use xv to give you coordinates and then use those coordinates as geometry options in imagemagick to actually do the cropping
