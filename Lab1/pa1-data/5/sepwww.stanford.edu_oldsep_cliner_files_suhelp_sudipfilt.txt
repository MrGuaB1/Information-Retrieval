sudipfilt dip or better slope filter in fk domain sudipfilt infile outfile optional parameters required parameters dt from header if not set in header then mandatory dx from header d1 if not set in header then mandatory optional parameters slopes 0.0 monotonically increasing slopes amps 1.0 amplitudes corresponding to slopes bias 0.0 slope made horizontal before filtering verbose 0 verbose 1 echoes information tmpdir if non empty use the value as a directory path prefix for storing temporary files else if the the cwp_tmpdir environment variable is set use its value for the path else use tmpfile notes d2 is an acceptable alias for dx in the getpar slopes are defined by delta_t delta_x where delta means change units of delta_t and delta_x are the same as dt and dx it is sometimes useful to fool the program with dx 1 dt 1 thus avoiding units and small slope values linear interpolation and constant extrapolation are used to determine amplitudes for slopes that are not specified linear moveout is removed before slope filtering to make slopes equal to bias appear horizontal this linear moveout is restored after filtering the bias parameter may be useful for spatially aliased data the slopes parameter is compensated for bias so you need not change slopes when you change bias credits cwp dave algorithm originally called slopef jack reformatting for su trace header fields accessed ns dt d2
