you guys should read the weekly world news you guys should read the weekly world news as retold by joster's popster joster's opinion of the men's room at webtv was that it was pretty embarassing there you would be standing at the urinal and your boss or one of the company founders would walk up beside you well what are you supposed to do turn away and pretend you didn t notice stare straight ahead at the wall and say nothing or should you turn toward him smile and strike up a conversation to jos the solution to this dilemma was immediately clear you need something to concentrate on something on the wall to read but what obviously a newspaper clipping of about the length as a pee but which newspaper those people like me stuck with telling this story have spent a lifetime avoiding such newspapers as the national enquirer and the weekly world news with headlines like princess diana secretly engaged to elvis on mars but from an early age jos's mind was open to everything in middle school 8th grade jos and his friend tyler dierks wrote their own parody of this genre the sleaze weekly back at webtv from time to time somebody important might walk in just when you are posting the clipping then you say i don t do this regularly i m just doing it for a guy who is away for a while jos was buried three days after he died before any news announcement of his funeral never the less the funeral home was overflowing with more than 300 people many of them his friends and acquaintances from work all arrived to find the benches decorated with copies of covers of the weekly world news it might seem a sacrilege but they knew that jos would cheer he would want everyone to smile if anyone caught them posting those covers on the pews they could say we don t do this regularly we re just doing it for a guy who is away for a while return to the life of jos
