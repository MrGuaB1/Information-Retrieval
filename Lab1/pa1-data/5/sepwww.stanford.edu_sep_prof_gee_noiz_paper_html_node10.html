de spiking with median smoothing next up previous print clean next de bursting up noise bursts previous noise bursts de spiking with median smoothing despike median smoothing the easiest method to remove spikes is to pass a moving window across the data and output the median value in the window this method of despiking was done in figure which shows a problem of the method the window is not long enough to clean the long bursts but it is already so long that it distorts the signal by flattening its peaks the window size really should not be chosen in advance but should depend upon by what is encountered on the data this i have not done because the long burst problem is solved by another method described next next up previous print clean next de bursting up noise bursts previous noise bursts stanford exploration project 4 27 2004
