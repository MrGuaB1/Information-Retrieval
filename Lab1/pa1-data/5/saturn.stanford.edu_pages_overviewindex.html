the saturn software analysis project home overview publications people download examples related projects contact saturn precise and scalable software analysis overview the saturn project is exploring techniques for highly scalable and precise analysis of software with applications to both bug finding and verification saturn is based on three main ideas saturn is summary based the analysis of a function f is a summary of f's behavior at call sites for f only f's summary is used saturn is also constraint based analysis is expressed as a system of constraints describing how the state at one program point is related to the state at adjacent program points the primary constraint language used in saturn is boolean satisfiability with each bit accessed by a procedure or loop represented by a distinct boolean variable program analyses in saturn are expressed in a logic programming language with some extensions to support constraints and function summaries in combination these ideas give saturn the ability to succinctly express precise analyses while also providing the ability to scale to very large programs the use of constraints and logic programs allows succinct analyses which are easier to understand and verify correct than analyses written at a lower level of abstraction bit level path sensitive analysis gives precision while analyzing a single function at a time and summarization give scalability as a result we are able to routinely run whole program saturn analyses on the entire linux kernel with more than 6mloc and other large open source projects collectively these analyses have found thousands of previously unknown bugs in such projects including projects that are already routinely checked by commercial bug finding tools the current version of saturn is a complete rewrite of the original system which was developed starting in early 2004 as a result the locking and memory leak bug finding analyses which were written in the old version are not currently supported in the new version the new version does provide a parallel implementation allowing multiple functions to be analyzed at the same time we generally use clusters of 25 80 processors depending on program size and the computational intensity of the analysis all saturn analyses are currently for c programs though the ideas could be applied to other languages saturn is supported by nsf grants ccf 0430378 which is partly funded by darpa cns 050955 and sa4899 10808pg 1 and gifts or fellowships from ibm intel and microsoft
