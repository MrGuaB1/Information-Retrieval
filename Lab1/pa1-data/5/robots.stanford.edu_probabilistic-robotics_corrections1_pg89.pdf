4.1 3 mathematical derivation of the histogram approximation page 1 4.1 the histogram filter 89 ones but at the expense of increased computational complexity as we already discussed the discrete bayes filter assigns to each region xk t a probability pk t within each region the discrete bayes filter carries no further information on the belief distribution thus the posterior becomes a piecewise constant pdf which assigns a uniform probability to each state xt within each region xk t p xt pk t xk t 4.2 here xk t is the volume of the region xk t if the state space is truly discrete the conditional probabilities p xk t ut xi t 1 and p zt xk t are well defined and the algorithm can be im plemented as stated in continuous state spaces one is usually given the densities p xt ut xt 1 and p zt xt which are defined for individual states and not for regions in state space for cases where each region xk t is small and of the same size these densities are usually approximated by substituting xk t by a representative of this region for example we might simply probe using the mean state in xk t xk t xk t 1 xk t xt dxt 4.3 one then simply replaces p zt xk t p zt xk t 4.4 p xk t ut xi t 1  xk t p xk t ut xi t 1 4.5 these approximations are the result of the piecewise uniform interpretation of the discrete bayes filter stated in 4.2 and a taylor approximation analo gous to the one used by ekfs 4.1 3 mathematical derivation of the histogram approximation to see that 4.4 is a reasonable approximation we note that p zt xk t can be expressed as the following integral p zt xk t p zt xk t p xk t 4.6 xk t p zt xt dxt xk t p xt dxt
