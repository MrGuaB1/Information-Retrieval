stanford autonomous helicopter project the stanford university autononomous helicopter project ground air vehicle cooperation the darpa sept 25 2003 experiment overview our expriment involves a ground vehicle planning a path through unknown terrain to explore the terrain the ground vehicle tasks an air vehicle which fies over the terrain and acquires a ground map the ground map is then radioed back to the ground vehicle and the path is modified accordingly results of the experiment performed at the darpa mars pi meeting in tyson's corner va the initial plan by the ground vehicle used to task the air vehicle video of the autonomous mapping flight animation of the map building during this flight the final ground model in vrml viewer can be downloaded here a 2 d map with the path planned by the ground vehicle segbot ground navigation at the experiment video footage of the navigating segbot two segbot navigation maps acquired from the ground map 1 and map 2 3 d map acquired by the segbot from the ground vrml model get viewer here and brief animation of the 3 d model and a more detailed animation an earlier practice run at stanford university movie of the autonomous mapping flight the raw data in vrml viewer can be downloaded here the final ground model with navigation analysis vrml file animation of this mapping run extracting the 2 d navigation grid map animation vehicle images helicopter on the ground and in the air the ground vehicle is a segway rmp see segbot com image 1 image 2 image 3 image 4 image 5 image 6 and image 7 powerpoint presentations results of the air ground experiment the reinforcement learning story if the avis don t play there are copies with other codecs at dirk haehnel's home page some background movies by andrew ng stable hover with reinforcement learning faiure of conditional control and four legged robot trained by reinforcement learning cs 223b introduction to computer vision stanford university main page air ground cooperation videos and animations
