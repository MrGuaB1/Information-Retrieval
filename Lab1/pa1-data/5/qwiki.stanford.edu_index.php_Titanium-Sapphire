titanium sapphire qwiki titanium sapphire from qwiki jump to navigation search god's gift to tunable lasers in the nir titanium doped sapphire ti s ti sapphire ti sapph is a remarkable laser medium with gain over an extremely broad range of wavelengths 660nm to 1180nm common ti sapph lasers however operate in the region from 700nm 1000nm ti sapph will lase simultaneously over a range of wavelengths making it an ideal laser medium for mode locked operation mode locked ti sapph lasers can generate pulses with sub 10fs pulse durations and peak powers in the many megawatts these lasers have featured prominently in the generation of optical frequency combs and the high peak intensities have made it possible to generate frequency combs which span more than an octave using ti sapph lasers and external nonlinear media ti sapph has a four level laser structure with a pump band from 400nm 600nm this range accommodates a variety of pump sources including argon ion frequency doubled nd ylf and diode lasers a common ti sapph laser is the coherent 899 series it is simultaneously very useful and somewhat annoying retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php titanium sapphire categories lab lore materials views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 5 october 2005 at 06 03 this page has been accessed 17575 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
