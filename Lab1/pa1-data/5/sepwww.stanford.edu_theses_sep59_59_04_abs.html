wavefield separation in anisotropic media and why it's not what you expect by joe dellinger wavefield separation in anisotropic media and why it's not what you expect by joe dellinger the divergence and curl operatiors are commonly used to separate p and s waves in two dimensional isotropic media clayton 1981 in the fourier domain a wavefield is viewed as a sum of plane wave components in this domain the divergence and curl operatiors separate p and s waves by their orthogonal particle motion directions on each plan wave in generalizing this simple scheme to three dimensions a complication arises even for the isotropic case it is not enough merely to identify three wavetypes at each k subscript x k subscript y k subscript x three global modes must be identified for the fourier domain as a whole ideally each mode should be continuous and well behaved everywhere unfortunately in three dimensions a mode cannot exhibit quasi s motion everywhere and still be continuous a more confusing problem mode mode coupling occurs with certain ani sotropic media for isotropic or tansversely isotropic media three modes can always be picked out usually called quasi p quasi sv and sh one might expect that slight perturbations away from transverse isotropy to orthorhombic symmetry should always leave these three modes identifiable instead the three original modes can exchange fragments and pull apart from each other this creates new continuous distinct modes that appear to be patched together out of the fragments of the orginal quasi p quasi sv and sh modes this phenomena can create new arrivals in the impulse response of the orthorhomic medium with no cournterpart in the unperturbed transversely isotropic medium crampin 1981 back to sep 59 index page download pdf 1784 kb ps gz 2561 kb stanford exploration project
