polypod modules polypod modules polypod is made up of two types of modules called segments and nodes segments are two degree of freedom parallel mechanisms composed of 10 links the kinematics of the resulting mechanism is similar to two prismatic joints joined together by a revolute joint where the prismatic joints are constrained to have the same length each segment module contains all the components to be a stand alone robot in itself except for power computation motorola xc68hc11e2 generously donated by motorola actuation two small dc motors with lead screw transmission sensing ir proximity sensing crude force torque sensing using ir joint angle position sensing potentiometers inter module communication global synchronous communication motorola spi with rs485 drivers between 68hc11's plus local ir communication between adjacent modules power is supplied by the second type of modules called nodes nodes are rigid cube shaped modules roughly 2 x2 x2 with 6 connection ports whose main purpose is to hold gel cel batteries and to allow for non serial chain robots by the time i graduated in dec 1994 i had 11 modules total here are some photos 200k of the physical robot back to polypod comments may be sent to mark yim at mark flamingo stanford edu last updated november 1996
