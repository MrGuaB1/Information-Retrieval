these movies are composites from two instruments aboard the soho spacecraft the region outside the black circle is from uvcs either hi lyman alpha intensity or o vi 1032 angstrom intensity as indicated and the inner image is from eit both sets of images show light emitted in the sun's hot corona from april to october 1996 the sun's magnetic field exhibited a well defined geometry with closed field loops encircling the equator and open field regions emerging from the north and south polar coronal holes because the sun rotates approximately once every 27 days we also see the rotation of bright active regions both on the surface and reaching out into the extended corona
