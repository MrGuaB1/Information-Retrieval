space weather monitors stanford solar center sid monitors awesome monitors science data obtaining a monitor distribution for educators student center installation and use the team publications references acknowledgements sid and awesome antennas space weather monitors sid and awesome antennas we have provided instructions with our sid monitors on how to build a couple untuned loop antennas however the styles options and sizes are almost unlimited can you design the ultimate best antenna for a sid monitor what are the tradeoffs between a small heavily wrapped one and a larger one with fewer wraps which is the best and how does one define best for a sid monitor what are the various tradeoffs between size number of loops types of wire antenna shape etc what are the principles of loop antenna design what are the effects of doubling or halving the number of wraps and or the diameter of the antenna how does the wire size affect sensitivity how far away from a transmitter must the antenna be to function properly how close is too close from how far away can various antennas pick up various stations what are ground waves and what do they have to do with transmitters and antennas one sid user used a 20 whip in this case a 20 foot vertical rod instead he noted it gave him a much stronger signal than either a tuned or untuned loop its other advantage is that it is omni directional what are the quantitative differences of using a whip instead of a loop what are the tradeoffs should we include instructions for setting up a whip as well as a loop the awesome monitors require a different type of antenna why what are the various options for size shape materials and tradeoffs for the awesome antennas surprisingly most of the answers are unknown or at least controversial if you are interested in exploring any of these issues you might get started by reading antenna basics and loop antennas stanford solar center contact us permitted uses credits 2008 by stanford solar center
