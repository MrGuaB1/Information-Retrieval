reflection coefficients spherical versus planar previous up next print clean next the rho filter up slant stack previous plane wave superposition reflection coefficients spherical versus planar the amplitudes that you see on the reflected waves on a field profile are affected by many things assume that corrections can be made for the spherical divergence of the wave the transmission coefficients through the layers inner bed multiples etc what remains are the spherical wave reflection coefficients spherical wave reflection strengths are not the same as the plane wave reflection coefficients calculated in fgdp or by means of zoeppritz 1919 equations theoretical analyses of reflection coefficient strengths are always based on fourier analysis the equations in 25 provide a link between plane wave reflection coefficients and cylindrical wave reflection coefficients see page 196 for going from cylinders to spheres previous up next print clean next the rho filter up slant stack previous plane wave superposition stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
