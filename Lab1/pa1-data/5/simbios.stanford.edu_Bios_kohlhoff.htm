kohlhoff simbios back to people kai kohlhoff i am a simbios distinguished postdoctoral fellow in stanford's bioengineering department working with prof vijay pande and prof russ b altman as my academic advisors my primary interest is in the application of computational techniques to improve our understanding of biological processes at simbios i work on developing new algorithms to make use of gpus as computing platform for the study of proteins their structure and function i am interested in how misfolding leads to the formation of protein aggregates their role in neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's parkinson's or type 2 diabetes and how we can use computational tools to generate new candidate compounds for drug development i also currently work on implementing modifications to the namd derived mindy software in order to obtain a minimal front end for running molecular dynamics simulations on graphics processors using the simbios openmm library prior to my appointment at stanford i received a triple major bsc degree in computer science bioinformatics and biology from jacobs university bremen in germany and an mphil in computational biology from the university of cambridge in england i completed my phd in the group of dr michele vendruscolo again at cambridge developing a new method to incorporate experimental data from nmr spectroscopy in molecular dynamics simulations i have been interested in a variety of scientific topics and fields including computer graphics software development analytical geometry genetics and aging feedback collaborations career resources administration contact
