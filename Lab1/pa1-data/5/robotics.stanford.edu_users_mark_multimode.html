polypod example locomotion with reconfiguration example locomotion with reconfiguration in this example polypod reconfigures itself three times to optimize its configuration for the type of locomotion required travelling down a long wooden planked corridor climbing under a metal railing and down a roughly 2 foot step traversing over undulating grassy terrain in each section the respective configurations taken are rolling loop the most efficient gait for flat terrain earthworm the best gait for obstacle crossing spider the most stable gait for uncertain terrain 1.8 m click on the image for a rather large mpeg video 1100 frames with a resolution 320x200 of a simulation 1.84 mb the last gait the spider gait has been designed but not yet simulated back to polypod comments may be sent to mark yim at mark flamingo stanford edu last updated 10 31 96
