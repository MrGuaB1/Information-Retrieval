the kim butts pauly research lab overview of view angle tilting the vat sequence is very simple it consists of a gradient on the slice select axis during readout of the same amplitude as the slice select gradient a schematic of how this causes the slice select shifts to compensate for the in plane shifts is given in the next figure check out how well vat works in this picture in the conventional spin echo image on the top there is a lot of distortion and piling up artifact although there are still slice select problems seen in the bottom image those spins that are seen are located in the correct readout position work still needs to be done to improve the slice selection process relevant lab publications butts k pauly j daniel b kee s norbash a management of biopsy needle artifacts techniques for rf refocused mri jmri 1999 9 4 586 595 duerk j butts k hwang k lewin j pulse sequences for interventional magnetic resonance imaging topics in magnetic resonance imaging 2000 11 3 147 62 daniel bl butts k the use of view angle tilting to reduce distortions in magnetic resonance imaging of cryosurgery magnetic resonance imaging 2000 18281 286 butts k pauly j gold g reduction of blurring in view angle tilting mri with multiple view angle tilting readouts mrm 2005 feb 53 2 418 24 butts pauly k gold ge correction of slice profile distortion from metallic devices 14th scientific meeting of the ismrm seattle may 2006 butts pauly k gold ge correction of slice profile distortion from metallic devices 14th scientific meeting of the ismrm seattle may 2006
