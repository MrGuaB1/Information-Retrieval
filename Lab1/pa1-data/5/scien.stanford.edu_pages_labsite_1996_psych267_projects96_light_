interactive lighting design interactive lighting design eugene jhong and andy vitus overview because the rendering process is linear with respect to light sources a fixed scene may be quickly re rendered for different lighting effects by linearly combining a set of basis images rendered with basis lights basis images the following are some basis images from an interactive lighting design program the interface allowed the user to change the intensity and direction of various light sources within a scene in the scene below the user was able to change the location of the sun and the direction of the table lamp and the two spot lights on the ceiling with precomputed basis images for each light source changing these parameters required less than a second for 256 x 256 images all images were rendered with a custom built ray tracer result images the following are some images which were captured from the program java demonstration the applet below is a crude port of our program and is slow in java it only allows for the movement of one light source a blue spot light on the ceiling the image quality is poor because the images which were rendered at 24 bit color at 251x251 resolution have been compressed to 65 x 65 jpegs for performance reasons references nimeroff j simoncelli e and dorsey j efficient re rendering of naturally illuminated environments in 5th eurographics workshop on rendering 1994 dobashi y kaneda k nakatani h and yamashita h a quick rendering method using basis functions for interactive lighting design in eurographics 95 1995 pp 229 240 teo patrick efficient linear re rendering for interactive lighting design research print e mail ejhong cs stanford edu avitus stanford edu home page last modified january 6 1997 by eugene jhong
