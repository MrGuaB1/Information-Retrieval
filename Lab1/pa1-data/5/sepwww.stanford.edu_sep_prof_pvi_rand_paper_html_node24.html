the covariance matrix of multiple signals next up previous print clean next bispectrum up crosscorrelation and coherency previous coherency the covariance matrix of multiple signals a useful model of single channel time series analysis is that random numbers x t enter a filter f t and come out as a signal y t a useful model of multiple channel time series analysis with two channels for example is to start with independent random numbers in both the x 1 t channel and the x 2 t channel then we need four filters f 11 t f 12 t f 21 t and f 22 t which produce two output signals defined by the z transforms 53 54 these signals have realistic characteristics each has its own spectral color each has a partial relationship to the other which is characterized by a spectral amplitude and phase typically we begin by examining the covariance matrix for example consider two time series y 1 t and y 2 t their z transforms are y 1 z and y 2 z their covariance matrix is 55 here z transforms represent the components of the matrix in the frequency domain in the time domain each of the four elements in the matrix of 55 becomes a toeplitz matrix a matrix of correlation functions see page the expectations in equation 55 are specified by theoretical assertions or estimated by sample averages or some combination of the two analogously to spectral factorization the covariance matrix can be factored into two parts where is an upper triangular matrix the factorization might be done by the well known cholesky method the factorization is a multichannel generalization of spectral factorization and raises interesting questions about minimum phase that are partly addressed in fgdp next up previous print clean next bispectrum up crosscorrelation and coherency previous coherency stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
