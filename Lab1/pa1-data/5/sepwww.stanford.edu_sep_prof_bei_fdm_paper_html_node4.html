the heat flow equation next up previous print clean next splitting up splitting and separation previous splitting and separation the heat flow equation we wish to solve equation 5 by a method involving splitting since equation 5 is an unfamiliar one we turn to the heat flow equation which besides being familiar has no complex numbers a two sentence derivation of the heat flow equation follows 1 the heat flow h x in the x direction equals the negative of the gradient of temperature t times the heat conductivity 2 the decrease of temperature is proportional to the divergence of the heat flow divided by the heat storage capacity c of the material combining these extending from one dimension to two taking constant and gives the equation 6 next up previous print clean next splitting up splitting and separation previous splitting and separation stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
