graeme w milton short biography graeme w milton short biography graeme w milton received b sc and m sc degrees in physics from the university of sydney australia in 1980 and 1982 respectively his research at sydney university focussed on electromagnetic wave propagation through ceramic metal composites with applications to solar energy he received a ph d degree in physics from cornell university in 1985 for research in statistical physics on models exhibiting anomalous phase transitions and for work in composite materials showing that certain self consistent approximations are exact for special microgeometries he subsequently went to the caltech physics department as a weingart fellow from 1984 to 1986 continuing on to the courant institute of mathematical sciences as assistant and associate professor of mathematics he is currently professor of mathematics at the university of utah salt lake city utah his current research includes analysing the effective properties of composite materials with particular interest in investigating new mathematical techniques which generate sharp bounds on the effective parameters and finding the microgeometries which attain the bounds he has studied questions relating to the electromagnetic and elastic properties of composites and to the properties of fluid filled porous rocks he has held both a sloan fellowship and a packard fellowship e mail to milton goanna math utah edu
