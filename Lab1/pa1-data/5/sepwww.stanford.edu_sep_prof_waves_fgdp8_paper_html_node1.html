waves in layered media next up print clean next reflection and transmission coefficients up table of contents waves in layered media the gravitational stratification of the earth arouses our interest in layered media there are many kinds of waves that can exist here we study waves without assuming knowledge of physics and differential equations we use only assumptions about the general principles of delay continuity and energy conservation the results are directly applicable to sound waves water waves light in thin films normal incident elastic waves of both pressure and shear type electromagnetic waves transmission lines and electrical ladder networks this chapter seems to concern itself only with vertically incident waves actually with certain precautions the theory here applies to the set of all waves with a fixed snell parameter a lengthier version of this chapter appears in chapter 8 in my book fundamental of geophysical data processing fgdp available on the web the lengthier web version also presents the solution to the more practical problem to deduce the reflection coefficients given the observed waves reflection and transmission coefficients the layer matrix energy flux getting the waves from the reflection coefficients layers between two halfspaces reflection seismology geometry getting reflection coefficients from the waves next up print clean next reflection and transmission coefficients up table of contents stanford exploration project 3 1 2001
