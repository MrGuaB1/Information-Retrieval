earth's surface boundary condition previous up next print clean next time domain analysis up wavemovie program previous wavemovie program earth's surface boundary condition the program that created figure 3 begins with an initial condition along the top boundary and then this initial wavefield is extrapolated downward so the first question is what is the mathematical function of x that describes a collapsing spherical actually cylindrical wave an expanding spherical wave has an equation where the radial distance is from the source for a collapsing spherical wave we need paranthetically i ll add that the theoretical solutions are not really these but something more like these divided by actually they should be a hankel functions but the picture is little different when the exact initial condition is used if you have been following this analysis you should have little difficulty changing the initial conditions in the program to create a downgoing plane wave shown in figure 4 mdipplane figure 4 specify program changes that give an initial plane wave propagating downward at an angle of 15 to the right of vertical view burn build edit restore notice the weakened waves in the zone of theoretical shadow that appear to arise from a point source on the top corner of the plot you have probably learned in physics classes of standing waves this is what you will see near the reflecting side boundary if you recompute the plot with a single frequency nw 1 then the plot will acquire a checkerboard appearence near the reflecting boundary even this figure with nw 4 shows the tendency previous up next print clean next time domain analysis up wavemovie program previous wavemovie program stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
