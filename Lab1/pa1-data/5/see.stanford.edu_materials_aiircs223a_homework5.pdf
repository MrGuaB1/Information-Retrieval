introduction to robotics cs223a homework 5 winter 2007 2008 page 1 introduction to robotics cs223a homework 5 winter 2007 2008 due wednesday march 05 1 a derive a formula that transforms an inertia tensor given in some frame c into a new frame a the frame a can differ from frame c by both translation and rotation you may assume that frame c is located at the center of mass b consider for example the uniform density box shown below it has mass m 12kg and dimensions 6 4 2 zc c y xc za ya xa 4 6 2 a c frame c lies at the center of mass of the box and the coordinate axes are ligned up with the principal axes of the box in other words yc is aligned with the long axis of the box and xc and zc are aligned with the short axes of the box compute the inertia tensor of the box in frame c note for a frame located at the center of mass and oriented along the principal axes the inertia tensor for the box of uniform density takes the form ci m 12 s2 y s2 z 0 0 0 m 12 s2 x s2 z 0 0 0 m 12 s2 x s2 y where sx sy and sz are the dimensions of the box along the xc yc and zc axes respectively c given the transformation matrix from c to a a ct 1 2 1 2 0 1 1 2 1 2 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 use your formula from part a and your inertia tensor from part b to compute the inertia tensor of the box in frame a page 2 2 in the rest of this problem set we will walk through the process of finding the equations of motion for a simple manipulator from the lagrange formulation consider the rp spatial manipulator shown below the links of this manipulator are modeled as bars of uniform density having square cross sections of thickness h lengths of l1 and l2 and total masses of m1 and m2 with centers of mass shown assume that the joints themselves are massless from the derivation in the lecture notes we know that the equations of motion have the form m q q c q q2 b q q q g q  where m is the mass matrix c is the matrix of coefficients for centrifugal forces b is the matrix of coefficients for coriolis forces and g is the vector of gravity forces a for each link i we have attached a frame ci to the center of mass in this case frame 2 is the same as c2 compute kinematics for these frames that is calculate the matrices 0 c1 t and 0 c2 t for a two link manipulator the mass matrix has the form m m1jt v1 jv1 m2jt v2 jv2 jt 1 c1 i1j1 jt 2 c2 i2j2 where jvi is the linear jacobian of the center of mass of link i ji is the angular velocity of link i and ci ii is the inertia tensor of link i expressed in frame ci b calculate 0jv1 and 0jv2 c calculate c1 j1 and c2 j2 d calculate c1 i1 and c2 i2 in terms of the masses and dimensions of the links you can use the same formula that was given for a box of uniform density in problem 2 b be careful which measurements you use along the axes e calculate the mass matrix m q to make your algebra easier leave the inertia tensors in symbolic form until the end ie c1 i1 ixx1 0 0 0 iyy1 0 0 0 izz1 page 3 now we need to calculate the centrifugal and coriolis forces we will derive the form directly f beginning with the equation in the lecture notes v q q m q 1 2 qt m q1 q qt m q2 q manipulate this equation symbolically into the form v q q c q q2 b q q q where c and b are matrices in terms of the partial derivatives mijk of the mass matrix don t actually substitute in your answer from part e into this equation yet just leave the elements of these matrices in mijk symbolic form g using your answer to part e compute the matrices c q and b q in terms of the masses dimensions and configuration q of the manipulator the last thing that remains is to derive the gravity vector g q h calculate 0g q the gravity vector in frame 0 in terms of the masses the configu ration q and the gravity constant g g is positive assume that gravity pulls things along the z0 direction be careful with your signs i as a final step use your answers to parts e h and i to write out the equations of motion as two great big equations 1 f1 q q q 2 f2 q q q
