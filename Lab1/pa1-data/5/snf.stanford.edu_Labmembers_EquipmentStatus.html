equipment status and problems equipment status and problems we ask that labmembers report all process and equipment problems on the coral system so that snf staff and other labmembers may follow the status of any piece of equipment each tool can have one of the following equipment states up when a piece of equipment is fully operational its coral icon is a green light problem when a problem is reported for a piece of equipment its icon becomes a yellow light in the yellow alert condition the equipment may be operated but there may be restrictions if yellow light icon is present you should check the equipment messages and station log for any special instructions failure to do so could result in damaging your wafers or the equipment if you are operating a tool and observe a problem however minor please use the report problem function on coral this will turn the equipment icon yellow and inform others of potential problems only staff has privileges to clear a yellow alert down when a piece of equipment is shutdown its icon is a red light in the red light condition the equipment is not usable if you are using a tool and it experiences problems depending on the tool you may be required to use the shutdown function on coral your training and the operating procedures will cover the circumstances and procedures for which an equipment shutdown may be required when equipment is in the red light state it cannot be used until it is cleared by staff unless your training skill or experience covers it you should not attempt to repair equipment your help however in observing and noting the symptoms of any equipment problems would be much appreciated back to top home sitemap search stanford nanofabrication facility webmaestro snf stanford edu last modified 08 29 2003
