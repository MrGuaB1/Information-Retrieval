variable norm deconvolution by william gray variable norm deconvolution by william gray variable norm deconvolution is a generalization of wiggin's minimum entropy deconvolution it is an iterative multichannel method which tries to achieve a deconvolution with a small number of events and least residual error it is shown to be related to minimizing the entropy of the inputs an efficient implementation in the frequency domain is presented it is applied to synthetics and a real data set results are subjectively equivalent to those achieved with other methods of deconvolution back to sep 14 index page download pdf 1494 kb ps gz 2181 kb stanford exploration project
