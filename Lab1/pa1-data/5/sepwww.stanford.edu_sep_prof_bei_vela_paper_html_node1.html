moveout velocity and stacking next up print clean next interpolation as a matrix up table of contents moveout velocity and stacking in this chapter we handle data as though the earth had no dipping reflectors the earth model is one of stratified layers with velocity a generally increasing function of depth we consider reflections from layers which we process by normal moveout correction nmo the nmo operation is an interesting example of many general principles of linear operators and numerical analysis finally using nmo we estimate the earth's velocity with depth and we stack some data getting a picture of an earth with dipping layers this irony that techniques developed for a stratified earth can give reasonable images of non stratified reflectors is one of the lucky breaks of seismic processing we will explore the limitations of this phenomenon in the chapter on dip moveout first a few words about informal language the inverse to velocity arises more frequently in seismology than the velocity itself this inverse is called the slowness in common speech however the word velocity is a catch all so what is called a velocity analysis might actually be a plane of slowness versus time interpolation as a matrix looping over input space looping over output space formal inversion the normal moveout mapping common midpoint stacking crossing traveltime curves ideal weighting functions for stacking gulf of mexico stack and agc velocity spectra velocity picking stabilizing rms velocity next up print clean next interpolation as a matrix up table of contents stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
