jot a note to your future college roommate relating a personal anecdote that reveals something about you well if we re to be roommates i should tell you about my only other relevant experience which was last summer i had been studying japanese at the university of alaska fairbanks for three weeks living in the dorms booked into a double my class was to be four weeks long and i was rather disappointed at not getting a roommate however i had my class and a job at the bike shop so i didn t give it much extra thought early in my stay i had caught a cold that was just now beginning to develop and in the past couple days i had grown quite sick as mommy was not there to save me the room had fallen into abject squalor my own side of the room was a mess my books lay everywhere my clothes were residing on both desks in the room and my pile of used tissues a staple of sick people everywhere had begun to stack up on the other bed i had gone out one night to get dinner and when i returned a few hours later i noticed that my near sacred pile of kleenexes had been unceremoniously removed from the other bed replaced by a gym bag my underwear no longer adorned the shelves it had been replaced by drakkar noir in my mind not much of an improvement i ran down to the check in desk where they told me indeed i did have a roommate and indeed he did try to get moved out of the room as soon as possible unsuccessful in this he kindly asked me to remove the innumerable figures of japanese hiragana from his side of the room after i apologetically obliged we decided to put the whole incident behind us what does this mean will i leave my clothes on the floor possibly will i stack my kleenex on your bed perhaps but doubtful will stanford reject me because i m a slob probably not their only reason is there anything else we should know about you without using my hands i can cover both my nostrils with my upper lip return to essays to jos claerbout
