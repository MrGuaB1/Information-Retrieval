spectral factorization up next print clean next root method up table of contents spectral factorization as we will see there is an infinite number of time functions with any given spectrum spectral factorization is a method of finding the one time function which is also minimum phase the minimum phase function has many uses it and it alone may be used for feedback filtering it will arise frequently in wave propagation problems of later chapters it arises in the theory of prediction and regulation for the given spectrum we will further see that it has its energy squeezed up as close as possible to t 0 it determines the minimum amount of dispersion in viscous wave propagation which is implied by causality it finds application in two dimensional potential theory where a vector field magnitude is observed and the components are to be inferred this chapter contains four computationally distinct methods of computing the minimum phase wavelet from a given spectrum being distinct they offer separate insights into the meaning of spectral factorization and minimum phase root method robinson's energy delay theorem the toeplitz method whittle's exp log method the kolmogoroff method causality and wave propagation up next print clean next root method up table of contents stanford exploration project 10 30 1997
