the littlewood richardson rule the littlewood richardson rule the littlewood richardson rule is a fundamental formula in combinatorics and representation theory on the one hand it can be thought of as describing induction in symmetric groups s_n x s_m s_ n m on the other hand it can also be thought of as describing the decomposition of the tensor products of irreducible representations of unitary groups whose characters are schur functions references for the littlewood richardson rule are macdonald symmetric functions and hall polynomials and fulton and harris representation theory a first course other littlewood richardson sites here from bayreuth is a web site providing access to the littlewood richardson rule this is an on line implementation of a function from the public domain symmetrica program a collection of routines performing useful functions related to representation theory particularly representation theory of the symmetric group here is an on line implementation of lie a program to do lie group calculations including the littlewood richardson rule the formerly commercial program lie has been freely available since july 1996 it is the work of arjeh cohen marc van leeuwen and bert lisser the web page of marc van leeuwen contains other material on the littlewood richardson rule and combinatorial algorithms ace is a maple package of combinatorial algorithms including the littlewood richardson rule there's an on line version available at their web site schur is a commercial package for calculations involving lie group representations and symmetric functions it too contains an implementation of the littlewood richardson rule littlewood richardson in mathematica here is a comparatively slow mathematica program which implements the littlewood richardson rule for our purposes a partition is a list of positive integers in descending order if p and q are partitions the function lrrule p q returns a list of partitions in reverse lexicographic order which arise from p and q by the littlewood richardson rule partitions can occur multiple times in the list they will appear with the correct multiplicity for example lrrule 2 1 2 1 returns 4 2 4 1 1 3 3 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 in this list of partitions 3 2 1 appears twice as it should since its coefficient is 2 an alternative form for the littlewood richardson rule is given by the function schur which implements the arithmetic of schur functions thus schur 2 1 schur 2 1 returns schur 3 3 schur 4 2 schur 2 2 2 2 schur 3 2 1 schur 4 1 1 schur 2 2 1 1 schur 3 1 1 1 illustrating the jacobi trudi identities define e n_ if n 0 0 schur table 1 n so e 3 schur 1 1 1 etc then det e 5 e 6 e 7 e 2 e 3 e 4 0 e 0 e 1 returns schur 3 2 2 1 1 back to daniel bump last modified sat sep 6 14 11 33 pdt 1997
