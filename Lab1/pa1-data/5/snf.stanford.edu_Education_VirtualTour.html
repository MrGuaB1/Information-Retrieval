education nanotechnology for everyone snf virtual tour education nanotechnology for everyone snf virtual tour the stanford nanofabrication facility snf a state of the art shared equipment 10000 sq ft clean room facility is housed in the paul allen center for integrated systems cis building which was built in 1985 snf descended from the integrated circuits laboratory which did pioneer work in silicon semiconductor device and processing technology as well as early medical systems research current applications extend over a wide range of disciplines such as optics micro electro mechanical systems mems biology and chemistry as well as traditional semiconductor and electronics device fabrication and process characterization while called a nanofabrication facility work in this facility covers the range of dimensions from nanometers to micrometers to even millimeters and centimeters you are welcome to take a virtual tour of the snf clean room first click here for to see an example process flow illustrating steps used in building micro and nanostructures then click on areas on the map below showing the floor plan of the clean room and additional areas that describe the different steps of the process in more detail from 1994 until 2003 snf was part of the 5 university national nanofabrication users network nnun this nsf funded initiative allowed us and the other members to provide our state of the art fabrication resources to industrial government and academic researchers across the country in 2004 this program was expanded to 13 universities renamed the national nanotechnology infrastructure network nnin and includes more resources for education and societal impact programs there are over 600 registered labmembers at the snf over 200 actively use the facility in any given calendar month labmembers come from a wide variety of institutions stanford university and slac 60 other universities and colleges 15 and industry and government 25 although the vast majority of labmembers are on site users of the snf a small percentage are remote users whom the technical liaisons and process staff will support in their research projects most academic users are ph d students working on their thesis research most of the industrial users are from small companies developing and prototyping new products the equipment in this laboratory has either been donated by equipment vendors or companies that manufacture semiconductors and other technology products see plaque near front door or has been purchased with research funds back to top home sitemap search stanford nanofabrication facility webmaestro snf stanford edu last modified 12 20 2005
