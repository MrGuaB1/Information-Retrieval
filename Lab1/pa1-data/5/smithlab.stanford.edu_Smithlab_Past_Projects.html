past projects burst modeling smith's doctoral research carried out in collaboration with fellow graduate student stuart thompson resulted in the first dynamic simulation of neuronal burst firing this simulation was based on representations of six variable ionic conductances each characterized through voltage clamp analysis and the first published computational model of intracellular ca dynamics ca ion dynamics smith introduced the first model of intracellular ca ion dynamics during his postdoctoral work 1977 1980 this work included development of ca measurement techniques to enable early empirical tests of ca model predictions the lab has continued to introduce new methods and protocols for imaging ca dynamics recently including phd student cris niell's pioneering use of in vivo ca imaging to map visual receptive fields in developing zebrafish presynaptic ca collaborations with bob zucker milton charlton george augustine and joann buchanan in the early 1980's established that presynaptic transmitter release at the squid giant synapse depends on intracellular ca ions in a steeply cooperative fashion and little or not at all on membrane potential nmda ca signaling a collaboration with amy macdermott mark mayer gary westbrook and jeff barker 1985 resulted in the first demonstration of ca influx through the glutamate operated nmda receptor channel this nmda ca permeability has proven fundamental to understanding most known forms of synaptic plasticity growth cone dynamics postdoc paul forscher used early digital video microscopy methods to explore the actin dynamics that shape axon growth and the motility of the neuronal growth cone this work began with a 198x collaboration with prof len kaczmarek and continued until the lab's late 1989 departure to stanford astrocytic ca signaling graduate student steven finkbeiner and postdocs ann cornell bell and mark cooper were the first to describe astrocytic ca waves and oscillations 1988 89 graduate students john dani and alex chernjavsky 1992 later established that astrocytic ca signals could be triggered by neuronal activity such ca signals are now known to couple neural activity to brain blood flow and may also shape neural development and functional activity patterns filopodia and synaptogenesis work in collaboration with craig jahr 1988 89 suggested that dynamic dendritic filopodia could mediate activity dependent synapse formation and that motile filopodia are precursors of dendritic filopodia later work by postdocs monica cooper michael dailey noam ziv james jontes martin meyer and graduate student cris niell 1989 2005 provided further evidence in support of these ideas retinal ca waves in a 1994 collaboration with prof carla shatz and rachel wong ca imaging by graduate student alex charnjavsky revealed spontaneous ca waves in developing retina such ca imaging subsequently has proven invaluable to the analysis of the mechanisms and effects of early retinal activity on neural circuit development tangential migration in a 1993 collaboration with prof susan mcconnell and nancy o rourke live tissue confocal imaging experiments by postdoc michael dailey led to the first observations of tangential migration of newborn neurons in developing neocortex such tangential migration is now recognized as a crucial element of brain development synaptic vesicle dynamics postdoc timothy ryan was the first to demonstrate the usefulness of betz fm dye synaptic vesicle probe for the study of mammalian cns synapses a long series of smith laboratory experiments 1992 2006 included the first single vesicle recordings and provided new information on many key properties of synaptic vesicle recycling dynamics transport packets postdoc mark cooper in 1990 developed an early ultra low light live cell imaging protocol that provided the first dynamic glimpse of membrane traffic through the golgi apparatus these experiments revealed traffic of membrane packets of highly variable size and shape later experiments on hippocampal neurons by md phd student susanne ahmari revealed similarly pleomorphic membrane transport packets transporting synaptic proteins to sites of synaptogenesis synaptotropic arbor growth phd student cris niell and postdoc martin meyer applied two photon microscopy and genetic labeling methods to observe the dynamic relationships between dendritic arbor growth and synaptogenesis in developing optic tectum of larval zebrafish the observations provided the first in vivo imaging evidence for synaptotropic guidance of dendritic arbor growth
