imaging reflections in elliptically anisotropic media figures figure captions figure 1 gif ps a wave reflected from a mirror in an isotropic medium figure 2 gif ps a wave reflected from a mirror in an elliptically anisotropic medium it is just figure 1 stretched and rotated another version of figure 1 gif ps showing a seismic survey over an isotropic medium another version of figure 2 gif ps showing a seismic survey over an elliptically anisotropic medium again it is just a stretched and rotated version of the previous figure and thus a migration of this data would produce a sharp but stretched image this shows that the elliptically anisotropic equivalent of time to depth mapping requires a layer by layer linear transformation step that allows both a vertical stretch and a horizontal shear as francis muir likes to say migration focus map also note that in this figure the source and geophones are stretched the wavefield may be kinematically identical but since in practice we don t use stretched geophones the amplitudes will differ between the equivalent isotropic and elliptically anisotropic experiments figure 3 gif ps converting a two layer physical model to its isotropic equivalent a wavefront radiating from a point source is shown in each layer if the layer is isotropic the wavefront is circular on the left is the true depth picture on the right is the picture that standard processing would infer from surface data alone using an isotropic assumption note the bottom interface appears horizontal even though it actually dips to the left the middle panel shows the conversion process after stretching the first layer
