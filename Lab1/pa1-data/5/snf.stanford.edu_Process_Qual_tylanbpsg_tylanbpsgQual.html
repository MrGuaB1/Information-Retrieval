uniformity testing procedure for tylanbpsg lto uniformity testing procedure for tylanbpsg lto purpose to provide a standard procedure to monitor oxide thickness and uniformity both wafer to wafer over a 52 wafer load and within a wafer frequency of test to be completed after major maintenance such as a tube change or on a set schedule to be determined or as needed based on user feedback documentation of results to be posted in hardcopy in the uniformity test book located in the lab posted in the email archive for tylanbpsg and keep in process maintenance group internal spreadsheet procedure use six new l test wafers 100 p type boron 10 20 ohm cm clean at wbdiff in the following sequence 4 1 h2so4 h2o2 ten minutes rinse 5 1 1 di hcl h2o2 ten minutes rinse 50 1 di hf 30 sec rinse spin dry load program lto400 into tylanbpsg time variable is 00 20 00 the boats must be loaded with dummies 26 wafers in each at all times to ensure uniform wafer to wafer deposition using very clean tweezers or vacuum wand replace the dummy wafers with a cleaned test wafers the following positions 1 st boat front in the third slot 1 st boat in the 13th 1 st boat in the 25 slot 2nd boat back in the third slot 2nd boat in the 13th 2nd boat in the 25 slot use nanospec to measure oxide thickness across each wafer in five locations test sites should be no more than about 15mm from the edge of the wafer record results on the uniformity testing form and post to appropriate email and spreadsheets if test's values aren t not within 10 of plotted test average contact the diffusion process maintenance team save wafers in a box with the date furnace number program name and growth time they may be re tested sometime in the future
