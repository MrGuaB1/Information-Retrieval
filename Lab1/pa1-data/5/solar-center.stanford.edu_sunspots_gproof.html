galileo's mathematical proof of sunspots how galileo used mathematics to prove the spots were on the sun let's describe a sunspot's movement geometrically as galileo did look at the figure where the circle represents a view of the sun from above and you represents you an observer on earth the points a b and c are points taken at equal distances on the surface of the sun and thus represent positions of a sunspot at equal intervals of time the apparent motion from a to b as seen by you is measured by the angle a you b compare it to the angle b you c which is obviously much larger since the time and distance are the same for a you b and b you c the spot appears to move much more slowly as it rounds the edge of the sun than when it passes across the middle of the disk on the other hand if the spot were a planet revolving around the sun as shown by the black circle the angles a you b and b you c differ by only a very small amount now can you do a calculation to express these results mathematically back to galileo's proof to other pages solar center homepage activities ask a solar physicist about the sun glossary related sites solar oscillations investigation at stanford the solar and heliospheric observatory spacecraft soho sign our guest book comments credits copyrights this page is http solar center stanford edu sunspots galileo1 html last revised by dks on may 19 1997
