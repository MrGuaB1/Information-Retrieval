magnetism and the sun stored energy in magnetic fields stored energy in magnetic fields back next home introduction magnetic fields magnetic force stored energy in magnetic fields magnetism on the sun further exploration bibliography the final aspect of magnetism that is necessary to have a basic understanding of the dynamics on the surface of the sun is the idea that magnetic fields can store energy the energy stored in a magnetic field is essentially the total amount of work required to assemble a system of moving charges stored energy in magnetic fields can be illustrated in the following experiment with a pair of magnets magnet acrobatics equipment two magnets procedure place a magnet on the table and hold it in place with one hand orient the other magnet above the one on the table such that each pole faces the same pole on the other magnet bring the top magnet down onto the other one on the table the magnets should repel each other as you do this hold the stacked magnets together let go of the magnets being sure to move your hands out of the way the magnets will perform their acrobatics what's going on when the two magnets are brought together a force must be exerted for a given distance ie work is being done to bring these two magnets together energy in the form of moving magnets is released when the one lets go of them this release of energy causes them to jump back next home introduction magnetic fields magnetic force stored energy in magnetic fields magnetism on the sun further exploration bibliography return to activities solar center homepage activities ask a solar physicist about the sun glossary related sites solar oscillations investigation at stanford the solar and heliospheric observatory spacecraft soho sign our guest book comments credits copyrights last revised by eugene on august 25 1999
