coral coral software system the suite of software tools used to run the snf lab is called coral which is the acronym for common object representation for advanced laboratories some of the key featured uses of this software are 1 to insure that only people who are trained and qualified to use a particular piece of equipment have access to it 2 to track equipment usage by individual lab members and thus generate bill accounts accordingly 3 to allow lab members to reserve equipment so that equipment use may be allocated in an efficient manner 4 to communicate both equipment and process problems to other lab members and staff each labmember is assigned a coral computer account this allows you to enable those tools in the lab which you have been trained and qualified to use enabling activates a piece of equipment and starts the clock for tracking your lab fees thus your coral account is linked to your billing information each lab member is required to have his or her own coral computer account even if several lab members are working on the same project and fees are charged to the same billing account see fees in addition a single individual working on several projects charged to different billing accounts might have several projects linked to his her coral computer account as in any other networked environment you are expected to be a responsible user you may use only your own individual account and access privileges do not share your account name and password with anyone understand also that use of snf computer resources is limited to activities which support your work in the lab back to top home sitemap search stanford nanofabrication facility webmaestro snf stanford edu last modified 08 29 2003
