sushift shifted windowed traces in time sushift stdin stdout tmin tmax tmin min time to pass tmax max time to pass defaults for tmin and tmax are calculated from the first trace verbose 1 echos parameters to stdout background tmin and tmax must be given in seconds in the high resolution single channel seismic profiling the sample interval is short the shot rate and the number of samples are high to reduce the file size the delrt time is changed during a profiling trip to process and display a seismic section a constant delrt is needed this program does this job the seg y header variable delrt delay in ms is a short integer that's why in the example shown below delrt is rounded to 123 sushift tmin 0.1234 tmax 0.2234 author toralf foerster institut fuer ostseeforschung warnemuende sektion marine geologie seestrasse 15 d 18119 rostock germany trace header fields accessed ns delrt trace header fields modified ns delrt
