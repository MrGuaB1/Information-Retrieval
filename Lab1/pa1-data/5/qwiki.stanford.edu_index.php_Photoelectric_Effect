photoelectric effect qwiki photoelectric effect from qwiki jump to navigation search the photoelectric effect is the process whereby electrons are emitted from a typically metallic surface being irradiated by an electro magnetic field while this effect is often cited as proof of the quantized nature of the electro magnetic field it can be readily analyzed semiclassically 1 thus it is a historical irony that einstein received his nobel prize 1 for the analysis of the photoelectric effect and the subsequent adoption of the photonic view of the electro magnetic field it is however more frustrating than ironic that mills of physics textbooks perpetuate the misconception that the photoelectric effect as understood circa 1905 requires the quantization of the electro magnetic field contents 1 basic effect 2 famous quotations 3 external links 4 notes and references basic effect brilliant stuff here famous quotations they should have taken back his nobel prize anonymous spring 2000 external links an english translation of einstein's original paper explaining the photoelectric effect can be found here wikipedia photoelectric effect applet notes and references retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php photoelectric_effect categories concept quantum optics views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 27 august 2005 at 16 28 this page has been accessed 11690 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
