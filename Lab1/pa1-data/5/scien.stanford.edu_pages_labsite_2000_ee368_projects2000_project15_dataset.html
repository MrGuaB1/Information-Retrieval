gender classification image database image database introduction database preprocessing algorithms results and conclusions references appendix our database consisted of 200 male and 200 female images of stanford medical students which were found on the web the images were all 200 by 200 pixels black and white photos that were taken using a frontal view examples of some of the images are shown in figure 1 below figure 1 examples of some of the images in our database we decided the most effective way to utilize our image database and test the performance of the algorithms was to implement a scaled down jackknife 1 2 scheme this entailed randomly choosing 20 males and 20 females to use as our testing set leaving the rest of the images to train the algorithms this was done 10 separate times thus allowing all of the images to be in a test set exactly once the algorithm results were averaged across all test sets to increase their statistical significance a more complete jackknife approach would have involved using all but one of the images to train the data testing the performance on the image left out and iterating this 400 times since this was too computationally expensive for 400 iterations of 400 images each 200x200 pixels in size we concluded that a training set of 360 images would be sufficiently large and thus we would only have to iterate 10 times instead of 400 times introduction database preprocessing algorithms results and conclusions references appendix
