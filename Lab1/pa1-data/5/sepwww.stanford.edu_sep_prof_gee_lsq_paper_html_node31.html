physical nonlinearity next up previous print clean next statistical nonlinearity up the world of conjugate previous the world of conjugate physical nonlinearity when standard methods of physics relate theoretical data to model parameters they often use a nonlinear relation say the power series approach then leads to representing theoretical data as 87 where is the matrix of partial derivatives of data values by model parameters say evaluated at the theoretical data minus the observed data is the residual we minimize 88 89 it is worth noticing that the residual updating 89 in a nonlinear problem is the same as that in a linear problem 44 if you make a large step however the new residual will be different from that expected by 89 thus you should always re evaluate the residual vector at the new location and if you are reasonably cautious you should be sure the residual norm has actually decreased before you accept a large step the pathway of inversion with physical nonlinearity is well developed in the academic literature and bill symes at rice university has a particularly active group next up previous print clean next statistical nonlinearity up the world of conjugate previous the world of conjugate stanford exploration project 4 27 2004
