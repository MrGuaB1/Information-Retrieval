effective medium theory concept concept of the cpa schematic diagram of the model composite used in the self consistent effective medium theory often called the cpa or coherent potential approximation the true composite is replaced by a large sphere dashed circle containing spherical inclusions of both type 1 and type 2 constituents in the proper relative proportions the matrix type is composed of a material with adjustable elastic constants when there is no net scattering the composite and matrix presumably have the same effective properties another effective medium theory concept references
