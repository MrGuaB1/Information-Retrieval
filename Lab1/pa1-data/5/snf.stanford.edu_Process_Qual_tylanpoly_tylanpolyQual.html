uniformity testing procedure for tylan1 4 and 7 uniformity testing procedure for tylanpoly purpose to provide a standard procedure to monitor poly thickness and uniformity both wafer to wafer and within a wafer frequency of test to be completed after major maintenance such as a tube change or on a set schedule to be determined or as needed based on user feedback documentation of results to be posted in hardcopy in the uniformity test book located in the lab posted in the email archive for the specific furnace and keep in process maintenance group internal spreadsheet procedure use four wafers with 1000a of sio2 clean at wbdiff in the following sequence 4 1 h2so4 h2o2 ten minutes rinse 5 1 1 di hcl h2o2 ten minutes rinse spin dry load program polyemit into tylanpoly furnace time variable is 00 15 00 load wafers into boats using very clean tweezers or vacuum wand load wafers with the major flat up into the boats in the following positions 1 st boat front 20 empty slots 1 st two dummies 1 st boat two test wafers slot 23 & 24 1 st boat one dummy 2nd boat one dummy 2nd boat two test wafers slot 2 &3 2nd boat one dummy 21 empty slots use nanospec to measure poly thickness at the flat center bottom left and right on each wafer test sites should be no more than about 15mm from the edge of the wafer record results on the uniformity testing form and post to appropriate email and spreadsheets if test's values aren t not within 10 of plotted test average contact the diffusion process maintenance team save wafers in a box with the date furnace number program name and growth time they may be re tested sometime in the future
