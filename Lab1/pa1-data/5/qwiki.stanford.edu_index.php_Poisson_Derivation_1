poisson derivation 1 qwiki poisson derivation 1 from qwiki jump to navigation search a conceptually simple method for deriving the poisson distribution is based on the continuous limit of the binomial distribution let's consider very small but not quite infinitesimal time intervals  t and suppose we have n of these intervals partitioning a large interval t n t in each interval the probability of an event is approximately  t with the approximation getting better and better as t goes to 0 then for this discrete case the probability of observing n events over the whole interval is given by the binomial distribution using stirling's formula the poisson distribution can be found by taking the limit and using stirling's approximation which is exact in the large n limit a variation on this theme that avoids the need for stirling's formula the following variation on this theme avoids stirling's formula it is because n and t do not change as n that the factor t n n can be taken out from within the lim now observe that the limits of the expressions over the first and third underbraces are equal to 1 and the limit of the expression over the second underbrace is e t therefore the limit we seek is just retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php poisson_derivation_1 categories concept probability views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 16 july 2007 at 18 58 this page has been accessed 10813 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
