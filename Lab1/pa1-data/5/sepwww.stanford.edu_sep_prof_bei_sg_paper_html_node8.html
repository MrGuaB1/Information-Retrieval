survey sinking with the dsr equation next up previous print clean next the survey sinking concept up imaging in shot geophone space previous seismic reciprocity in principle survey sinking with the dsr equation exploding reflector imaging will be replaced by a broader imaging concept survey sinking a new equation called the double square root dsr equation will be developed to implement survey sinking imaging the function of the dsr equation is to downward continue an entire seismic survey not just the geophones but also the shots peek ahead at equation 13 and you will see an equation with two square roots one represents the cosine of the wave arrival angle the other represents the takeoff angle at the shot one cosine is expressed in terms of k g the fourier component along the geophone axis of the data volume in s g t space the other cosine with k s is the fourier component along the shot axis the survey sinking concept survey sinking with the double square root equation the dsr equation in shot geophone space the dsr equation in midpoint offset space next up previous print clean next the survey sinking concept up imaging in shot geophone space previous seismic reciprocity in principle stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
