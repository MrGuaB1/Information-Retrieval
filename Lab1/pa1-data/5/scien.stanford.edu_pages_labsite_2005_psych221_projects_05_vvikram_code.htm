code listing code listing i used matlab 27 for coding all the m files are documented the files which started with demo_ are convenient files which are drivers for the code and the demo_ files can be run simply core matlab files are lsb simple stego lsb_stego m lsb text stego encode lsb_send m lsb text stego decode lsb_recv m palette sorting stego palette_stego m zhao & koch dct stego encode jpeg_stego_encode m zhao & koch dct stego decode jpeg_stego_decode m spread spectrum watermark encode spread_watermark_insert m spread spectrum watermark decode spread_watermark_extract m the demo files are demo file for lsb simple stego & lsb text stego decode encode demo_lsb m demo file for zhao & koch dct stego encode & decode demo_jpeg_stego m demo file for spread spectrum encode & decode demo_spread_watermark m helper files remove lsb from matrix removelsb m find top n values from a matrix findnmax m external toolbox new to matlab and as i didnt have image toolbox initially on my computer i used jpegtoolbox 26 for block dct transform before i realized i could do blkproc and dct i used blkproc in spread_spectrum code but in the zhao & koch code i used the toolbox only to do block dct the files from the toolbox are included for complete refrence bdct m bdctmtx m im2vec m ibdct m vec2im m
