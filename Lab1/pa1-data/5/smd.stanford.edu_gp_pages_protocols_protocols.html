genepattern protocols protocols for running common analyses in genepattern run an analysis in genepattern learn how to run an analysis in genepattern by preprocessing gene expression data and visualizing the resulting data as a heat map differential expression analysis find genes that are significantly differentially expressed between classes of samples clustering group genes and or samples by similar expression profiles prediction create a model also referred to as a classifier or class predictor that correctly classifies unlabeled samples into known classes snp copy number and loss of heterozygosity determination compute snp copy number cn and loss of heterozygosity loh based on affymetrix snp chip data for paired target normal samples
