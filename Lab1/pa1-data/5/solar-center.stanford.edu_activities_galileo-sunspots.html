are sunspots really on the sun stanford solar center about the sun for students for educators space weather monitors ancient observatories solar folklore solar art & literature are those sunspots really on the sun summary of activity students will acquire solar images or draw sunspots and record coordinates of sunspots they will calculate and plot their apparent movement and describe their shapes they will determine whether sunspots are features on the surface of the sun or objects in orbit around it to see the printable version of this activity click here duration of activity about 1 hour for preparation 1 4 hour per day for 10 14 days if you choose to collect new data at least 1 3 hours for analyzing data answering questions and doing optional calculations student prerequisites basic knowledge of the sun and planets concept of coordinates longitude and latitude measuring plotting basic geometric terms ie width to height ratio optional angular velocity speed of rotation vs linear velocity high school mathematics preparation & supplies needed sunspot recording worksheets print out and make enough copies for each day of your observations latitude longitude grids you may have to enlarge shrink these with your computer or copier to make them match your solar disk images and it will be easiest if you can copy them onto transparency paper sunspot speed graphs print these out or make copies for each person computer & access to the internet you will download an image of the sun every day for about 2 weeks either intensitygrams or magnetograms copier machine and transparency paper recommended a basketball and a tennis ball optional introduction when galileo galilei discovered sunspots he had a problem here it was 1612 and he had just pointed his new version of the dutch tool called a telescope towards the heavens not only did he discover the moons of jupiter the seas and craters on our own moon and the phases of venus but he also found what he thought to be dark smudges on the sun how could this be after all the catholic church taught that the heavens were perfect so there could not be imperfections or spots on the sun remember that it is dangerous to look directly at the sun through binoculars or in any other way the german astronomer christoph scheiner claimed the spots must be tiny undiscovered planets circling the sun which would occasionally pass in front of its disk try this experiment and see if galileo was right objectives students will observe sunspots and consider ways to determine whether they are on the sun or in orbit around the sun galileo's dilemma collect and record sunspot data images for 2 weeks or use sample data provided tabulate data and draw inferences from their numbers answer questions and participate in group discussion before the activity and after grade level 5 12 relationship to national standards procedure please read the whole procedure and complete the quiz and group discussion before you begin collecting data note that most but not all sunspots appear in groups so to make things simpler we will call them sunspot groups even in cases when there may be just one sunspot data analysis questions let us know how did this lesson work in your classroom home request solar posters site map glossary about us contact us 2008 by stanford solar center permitted uses credits
