ree program suggestions top 10 ree program suggestions 1 we suggest starting with an evening reception with no formal program in order to allow participants to reconnect with existing colleagues and meet new people followed by a one and a half day of programmed meetings 2 it is great to get senior member of the university to welcome the guests either at the evening reception or at the beginning of the first full day of the conference 3 we have learned that it is best to leave lots of time between sessions for networking between participants this is where a lot of the important discussions take place 4 consider picking a theme for the meeting that reflects the local issues for example there might be a focus on technology commercialization sustainable technology teaching tools or social entrepreneurship this topic might serve as a motivator for a subset of the sessions 5 consider asking participants to send slides that can be used for a poster session a sample template for six slides is in the file the slides can be printed or distributed electronically so that all participants can learn more about all the represented programs 6 it is valuable to have more workshops than formal talks this reinforces an environment of collaboration between the participants formal talks should be from high profile speakers who have an important message that is relevant to most participants 7 it is important to select session leaders who are great facilitators it is better to pick the best facilitators than to feel that you need to include everyone 8 it is great to get students involved as note takers they appreciate the opportunity to meet the visiting faculty and faculty enjoy meeting them also the notes are a valuable record of the discussions 9 participants very much appreciate the opportunity to see the local city therefore it is great to host an evening social event off campus 10 consider using the conference to increase the visibility of your program at your university and in your community some schools open some of the sessions to local industry and government leaders this is also a great way to gain financial sponsorships for the conference
