$17 million grant to advance simulations of hypersonic flight news release march 7 2008 $17 million grant to advance simulations of hypersonic flight the promise of an airplane capable of cruising at hypersonic speeds is exhilarating traveling from san francisco to sydney in 90 minutes or taking off from an ordinary airport and flying into orbit around the earth an important reason why such technology is still experimental however is that hypersonic vehicles are incredibly expensive and risky to build and test as a result accurate computer simulation is critical to fill that need a new $17 million five year cooperative agreement with the us department of energy's national nuclear security administration nnsa will fund researchers based at stanford as they strive to develop predictive simulations of hypersonic flight vehicles predicting phenomena on a computer using simulation technology doesn t require the humongous expenses of physical flight testing and laboratory testing says parviz moin the franklin p and caroline m johnson professor in the school of engineering and the project's director but hypersonic flight systems cannot be predicted well with today's state of the art simulation capabilities hypersonic flight refers to flight at speeds at least five times faster than the speed of sound or roughly 3400 miles an hour at 30000 feet until the last decade sustained hypersonic flight had only been achieved with rockets rather than air breathing jet engines rockets need to carry their own oxygen source but jets make use of the oxygen in the atmosphere making them more practical for transportation an example of the kind of plane the scientists will simulate is nasa's x 43 an experimental craft that has flown at mach 9.6 or 9.6 times the speed of sound predictive science the primary focus of the project is the application of verified and validated computational simulations an extra assurance of accuracy to predict the behavior of complex systems where routine experiments are not feasible the challenge for the researchers will be to develop algorithms that can model the unique physical phenomena involved in hypersonic travel turbulence aerodynamics combustion thermal loads and shockwaves are all different at mach 10 than in conventional airplanes or even at the lower end of supersonic flight the research effort announced march 7 as part of the predictive science academic alliance program psaap administered by the national nuclear security administration office of advanced simulation and computing nnsa asc involves 16 faculty members from stanford's departments of mechanical engineering computer science chemical engineering aeronautics and astronautics and mathematics stanford researchers will collaborate with colleagues at the university of michigan and the state university of new york at stony brook on aspects of the work stanford and other psaap centers will focus on unclassified applications of interest to the nnsa and its three national laboratories lawrence livermore los alamos and sandia the psaap centers will develop not only the science and engineering models and software for their large scale simulations but also methods associated with the emerging disciplines of verification and validation and uncertainty quantification the goal of that research is to enable scientists to make precise statements about the degree of confidence they have in their simulation based predictions to perform the simulations the researchers will have access to some of the nnsa's fastest supercomputers one such machine named red storm has a theoretical peak performance of 124 trillion operations per second and ranks sixth in the world in supercomputer performance according to the website top500 org the new psaap grant follows on a previous nnsa asc funded program at stanford in that 10 year $45 million program moin and colleagues developed a comprehensive integrated simulation of a conventional jet engine in that case as in the new research moin said that defining the research with an overarching problem in mind rather than starting from a set of smaller challenges in particular specialties has been effective in promoting interdisciplinary research this has been a great model he says how do you get people coming from autonomous departments to come and work together having an overarching problem is a great way of doing that david orenstein is the communications and public relations manager at the stanford school of engineering contact david orenstein school of engineering 650 736 2245 davidjo stanford edu comment parviz moin mechanical engineering 650 723 9713 moin stanford edu 30 stanford university all rights reserved stanford ca 94305 650 723 2300 terms of use copyright complaints
