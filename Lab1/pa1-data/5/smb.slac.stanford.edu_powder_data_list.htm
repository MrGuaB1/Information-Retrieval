data we routinely run a few standard samples to characterize the beamline and calibrate the diffractometer the data thus collected is available through the links below lanthanum hexaboride powder lab 6 epoxied on to a 1 inch square glass slide is used as a standard on beamline 2 1 the sample was obtained from gem dugout the lattice parameter of the sample was found to be 4.1566 a it was referenced against si powder nist srm 640b we routinely use this flat plate to calibrate the wavelength and the 2q zero offset the diffractometer resolution functions were obtained from this sample we also use this sample to determine the instrumental profile parameters for a reitveld type full profile analysis lab 6 crystallizes in pm 3m la atoms occupy the wycoff sites 1a at 0 0 0 b atoms occupy the wycoff sites 6f at 0.1933 0.5 0.5 datasets are available as either two column ascii files 2q and intensity gsas files silicon si we use nist standard reference material 640b mounted into a 0.3 mm glass capilliary to calibrate the wavelength and diffractometer zero si crystallizes in fd 3m datasets are available as either two column ascii files 2q and intensity gsas files back to ssrl powder diffraction page
