pacific symposium on biocomputing 2005 this is the post event web site for psb 2005 information on the upcoming psb is now available the psb 2005 attendance list electronic proceedings submitted psb related links and other useful information can be found below pacific symposium on biocomputing 2005 the pacific symposium on biocomputing psb 2005 was an international multidisciplinary conference for the presentation and discussion of current research in the theory and application of computational methods in problems of biological significance papers and presentations were rigorously peer reviewed and were published in an archival proceedings volume psb 2005 was held january 4 8 2005 at the fairmont orchid on the big island of hawaii psb 2005 brought together top researchers from the us the asian pacific nations and around the world to exchange research results and address open issues in all aspects of computational biology psb is a forum for the presentation of work in databases algorithms interfaces visualization modeling and other computational methods as applied to biological problems with emphasis on applications in data rich areas of molecular biology the psb has been designed to be responsive to the need for critical mass in sub disciplines within biocomputing for that reason it is the only meeting whose sessions are defined dynamically each year in response to specific proposals psb sessions are organized by leaders in the emerging areas and targeted to provide a forum for publication and discussion of research in biocomputing's hot topics in this way psb provides an early forum for serious examination of emerging methods and approaches in this rapidly changing field psb 2005 sessions inferring snp function using evolutionary structural and computational methods biogeometry applications of computational geometry to molecular structure inferring function from structural genomics targets computational approaches for pharmacogenomics joint learning from multiple types of genomic data biomedical ontologies psb 2005 tutorials use of multi locus data in gene mapping studies association mapping design issues and data analysis approaches data analysis and sharing with web services function prediction from high throughput to individual proteins the list of attendees is available peer reviewed papers the core of the conference consists of rigorously peer reviewed full length papers reporting on original work the online proceedings contain 100 of the papers the 2005 bound proceedings volume is available for $50.00 plus shipping if you are interested in purchasing it please send an email to the psb coordinator at psb helix stanford edu the complete set of peer reviewed papers is available as a bound proceedings volume and can be ordered from world scientific press see the original call for papers for more information keynote speakers david eisenberg professor of chemistry & biochemistry and molecular biology and director ucla doe lab of structural biology & molecular medicine at the university of california los angeles gave a keynote lecture entitled protein interactions arti k rai professor of law at duke university law school gave a keynote lecture entitled open source biomedical research promise and perils sponsors psb gratefully acknowledges the support of its sponsors we would like to offer a special thanks to the department of energy and the national library of medicine national institutes of health for their participation since the founding of the conference and for their commitment to travel support for psb 1999 psb 2000 psb 2001 psb 2002 psb 2003 psb 2004 and psb 2005 psb is affiliated with the international society for computational biology please visit our sponsors web sites and let them know you appreciate their support of psb department of energy national library of medicine international society for computational biology applied biosystems hp if you or your organization would like to be a sponsor of psb please contact the psb coordinator previous psb meetings information about previous psb meetings including the full electronic proceedings is available the 2004 psb meeting the 2003 psb meeting the 2002 psb meeting the 2001 psb meeting the 2000 psb meeting the 1999 psb meeting the 1998 psb meeting the 1997 psb meeting the 1996 psb meeting for more information psb conference coordinator tiffany jung psb coordinator department of genetics 300 pasteur dr l301 mc 5120 stanford ca usa 94305 5120 telephone 650 725 0659 fax 650 725 3863 this page is no longer being updated last update january 13 2005
