run an analysis in genepattern run an analysis in genepattern protocols each genepattern protocol helps you run an analysis by guiding you from one module to the next in this protocol you preprocess gene expression data and use a heat map to visualize the results alternative you can also run genepattern modules directly without using the protocols the quick start provides a quick hands on introduction to running modules directly before you begin gene expression data must be in a gct or res file example file all_aml_test gct learn more file formats step 1 preprocessdataset preprocess gene expression data to remove platform noise and genes that have little variation open module in the genepattern window open module with example data in the genepattern window considerations preprocessdataset can preprocess the data in one or more ways in this order set threshold and ceiling values any value lower higher than the threshold ceiling value is reset to the threshold ceiling value convert each expression value to the log base 2 of the value remove genes rows if a given number of its sample values are less than a given threshold remove genes rows that do not have a minimum fold change or expression variation discretize or normalize the data if you did not generate the expression data check whether preprocessing steps have already been taken before running the preprocessdataset module learn more preprocessdataset step 2 heatmapviewer display a heat map of the preprocessed gene expression data open heatmapviewer open heatmapviewer with example data considerations the heatmapviewer displays gene expression data as a heat map which makes it easier to see patterns in the numeric data gene names are row labels and sample names are column labels learn more heatmapviewer
