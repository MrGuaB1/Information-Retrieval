prior and posterior distributions next up previous print clean next jensen average up related concepts previous related concepts prior and posterior distributions random variables have a prior distribution and a posterior distribution denote the prior by b i for before and posterior by a i for after define p i a i b i and insert p i in any of the inequalities above now suppose we have an adjustable model parameter upon which the a i all depend suppose we adjust that model parameter to try to make some jensen inequality into an equality thus we will be adjusting it to get all the p i equal to each other that is to make all the posteriors equal to their priors it is nice to have so many ways to do this one for each jensen inequality the next question is which jensen inequality should we use i cannot answer this directly but we can learn more about the various inequalities next up previous print clean next jensen average up related concepts previous related concepts stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
