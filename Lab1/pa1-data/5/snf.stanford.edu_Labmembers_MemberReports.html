acknowledging snf labmember reports and acknowledgements we ask that labmembers help snf by doing the following 1 acknowledging any contributions of snf resources to your work please help snf by acknowledging any use of snf resources in your work part of the value of snf lies in part in the visibility our facility maintains in the research community as such we ask that lab members acknowledge any contributions of snf resources in publications or presentations a written acknowledgement should read like this work was performed in part at the stanford nanofabrication facility a member of the national nanotechnology infrastructure network which is supported by the national science foundation under grant ecs 9731293 its lab members and the industrial members of the stanford center for integrated systems in presentations please simply list the stanford nanofabrication facility with your other acknowledgements we greatly appreciate your support 2 by submitting a brief annual report the national science foundation through the nnin requires the snf to provide an annual report detailing various statistics on lab member activities at our facility in order to prepare this report we ask that all active lab members submit a brief summary of their research projects on an annual basis the report should not contain any sensitive information as it may be used in public forums to illustrate the broad range of research taking place at snf we realize that an annual report is yet another imposition on your time however this information is important not only for reporting to nsf but also for allowing us to keep track of the types of activities that are ongoing at snf this will help us to plan for future developments such as equipment purchases staffing needs and other such infrastructure requirements and so is a valuable tool for helping us to serve our lab members back to top home sitemap search stanford nanofabrication facility webmaestro snf stanford edu last modified 04 26 2004
