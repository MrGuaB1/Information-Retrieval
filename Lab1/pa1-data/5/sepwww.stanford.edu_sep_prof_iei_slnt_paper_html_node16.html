plane wave superposition previous up next print clean next reflection coefficients spherical versus up slant stack previous inverse slant stack plane wave superposition equation 23 can be simply interpreted as plane wave superposition to make this clear we first dispose of the rho filter by means of a definition 24 equation 24 will be seen to be more than a definition we will see that can be interpreted as the plane wave spectrum substituting the definition 24 into both 23 and 14 gives another transform pair 25 to confirm that may be interpreted as the plane wave spectrum we take to be the impulse function and substitute it into the top half of 25 the result is an impulsive plane wave as expected previous up next print clean next reflection coefficients spherical versus up slant stack previous inverse slant stack stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
