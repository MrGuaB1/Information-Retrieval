main optimal tuning home approach papers code results contact what is this we have conducted an extensive computational experiment lasting multiple cpu years to optimally select parameters for a few important classes of algorithms for finding sparse solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations the resulting algorithms run out of the box with no user tuning it is not necessary to select thresholds or know the likely degree of sparsity to see our approach you may check here why do it many of the better known papers in the field of compressed sensing discuss what can be proved rigorously using mathematical analysis often what can be proved is vague with unspecified constants or very weak unrealistically strong conditions are assumed far from what can be met in applications for practical engineering applications it is important to know what really happens rather than what can be proved empirical studies provide a direct method to give engineers useful guidelines about what really does happen from the theoretical point of view it will provide us with new and important conjectures to prove which algorithms we considered these algorithms 1 iterative hard thresholding iht with fixed false alarm rate 2 iterative soft thresho soft thresholding ist with fixed false alarm rate 3 two stage thresholding tst it is a generalization of cosamp and subspace pursuit 4 orthogonal matching pursuit omp 5 least angle regression lars our approach in optimizing these algorithms is explained here or in our paper philosophy of this website this website implements the concept of reproducible research the idea is an article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself it is merely advertising of the scholarship the actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures contributors arian maleki david donoho
