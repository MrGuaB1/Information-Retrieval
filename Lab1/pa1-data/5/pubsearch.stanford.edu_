pubsearch pubtrack pubfetch home page home peer reviewed research articles remain the best medium for representing and disseminating the refinement of scientific knowledge for any model organism database mod the literature is one of the main data sources and significant resources are devoted to capturing this information this project is a collaboration between the arabidopsis information resource tair and the rat genome database rgd two mods with an emphasis on literature curation here we propose to develop a literature curation tool that fulfills fundamental needs of a mod in extracting information from the literature three major components of this system are importing articles from various literature databases storing screening prioritizing and curating articles and tracking of prioritized articles through the manual curation procedure our long term goal is to develop a set of systematic procedures and tools for integrating knowledge from the confined context of a research article into the dynamic broad context of a model organism database both groups have developed different software components to facilitate in house curation efforts and we propose to integrate these components to build a powerful portable and generic literature curation system by building upon the existing developments undertaken at both sites and working together to achieve an integrated literature curation solution we will maximize the utility and flexibility of the system we create the system will be central to the curation efforts of the collaborating databases and will be useable as a whole or in parts by other existing or emerging mods our proposed specific aims are as follows expand and enhance existing rgd modules to create a robust extensible literature database search and retrieval module pubfetch this will enable literature retrieval from multiple literature databases using a consistent data exchange format extend and improve tair pubsearch tool to provide a robust adaptable curation module to store search annotate and prioritize articles for mod curation this will use the pubfetch module as its literature data source allow curators to screen prioritize and curate information in the literature and provide output in a standard data format for mods create a literature tracking module pubtrack to track and report the status of article curation by the mod curation team this will be designed to interface with the pubsearch or an existing mod literature database and will be configurable to reflect the curation process used by any individual mod this project has been funded by the national human genome institute nhgri grant number r01hg02728
