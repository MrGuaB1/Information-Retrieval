motion corrected image denoising for digital photography motion corrected image denoising for digital photography brendan duncan abstract an effective way to reduce noise in images involves taking a burst of snapshots and averaging them together this requires that they be aligned and that there is no motion or parallax across the images otherwise this averaging causes motion blur and ghosting effects in this paper i introduce a new technique for both the alignment and averaging of a burst of photos of a single scene the alignment is performed using multiple applications of sift and ransac to match both background and moving foreground objects in a scene a weighted average is then calculated at each pixel using the bilateral filter to provide an estimate of the denoised result this weighted average reduces the contribution from noisy pixels as well as from unmatched pixels resulting from motion across images paper pdfimg jpg paper 11.1 mb pdf presentation pptimg jpg presentation 10.5 mb ppt code code 44kb zip this code requires opencv it is not optimized and does not employ a fast implementation of the bilateral filter it includes modified sift code from rob hess moving foreground object images input images images uni1 jpg images uni2 jpg images uni3 jpg images uni4 jpg images uni5 jpg images uni6 jpg weights result of algorithm images uniweights png images unires jpg parallax images input images images para1 png images para5 png images para3 png images para4 png images para6 png images para2 png simple average result of algorithm images paraavg png images parares jpg brendan duncan 2010
