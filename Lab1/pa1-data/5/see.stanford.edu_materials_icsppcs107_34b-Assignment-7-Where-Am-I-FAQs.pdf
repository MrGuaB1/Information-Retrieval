1 question i get some small numerical differences from the answers in the handout what's up answer the starter code has a page 1 1 question i get some small numerical differences from the answers in the handout what's up answer the starter code has a different version of intersect than jerry's solution uses the starter code version is actually better because it fixes a subtle bug specifically you re probably seeing some differences with intersection points and best estimate for intersection points the values you should be getting are kawa 6 intersection points 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0.5 0.8660254037844386 0.5 0.8660254037844386 2.220446049250313 e 16 1.0 1.0 2.220446049250313 e 16 0.1339745962155614 0.5 1.8660254037844386 0.5 for best estimate you ll probably be getting kawa 7 best estimate 1 0 0 1 2 0 0.1 1 0 5.942527670663228 e 4 0.9983333333333334 0.033291640592396976 the final values for the where am i example will still be almost identical to those in the handout there may be a bit of variation in the final few decimal points thanks to the students who noticed this and let us know about it we apologize for any inconvenience
