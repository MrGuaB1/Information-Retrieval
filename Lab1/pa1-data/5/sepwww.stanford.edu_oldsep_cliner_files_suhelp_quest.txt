quest functions to estimate quantiles quest returns estimate use when entire array is in memory questalloc returns quantile estimator use before questupdate questupdate updates and returns current estimate use for large numbers of floats too big to fit in memory at one time questfree frees quantile estimator quest input p quantile to be estimated 0.0 p 1.0 is required n number of samples in array x n 5 is required x array n of floats returned the estimate of a specified quantile questalloc input p quantile to be estimated 0.0 p 1.0 is required n number of samples in array x n 5 is required x array n of floats returned pointer to a quantile estimator questupdate input q pointer to quantile estimator as returned by questalloc n number of samples in array x x array n of floats returned quantile estimate questfree q pointer to quantile estimator as returned by questalloc notes quest the estimate should approach the sample quantile in the limit of large n the estimate is most accurate for cumulative distribution functions that are smooth in the neighborhood of the quantile specified by p this function is an implementation of the algorithm published by jain and chlamtac 1985 questalloc this function must be called before calling function questupdate see also notes in questupdate questupdate the estimate should approach the sample quantile in the limit of large n the estimate is most accurate for cumulative distribution functions that are smooth in the neighborhood of the quantile specified by p this function is an implementation of the algorithm published by jain r and chlamtac i 1985 the pp algorithm for dynamic calculation of quantiles and histograms without storing observations comm acm v 28 n 10 reference jain r and chlamtac i 1985 the pp algorithm for dynamic calculation of quantiles and histograms without storing observations comm acm v 28 n 10 author dave hale colorado school of mines 05 07 89
