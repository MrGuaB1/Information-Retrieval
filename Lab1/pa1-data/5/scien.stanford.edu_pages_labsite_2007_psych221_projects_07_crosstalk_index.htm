optical crosstalk in cmos image sensors optical crosstalk in cmos image sensors chris fesenmaier and benjamin sheahan psych 221 winter 2006 2007 welcome introduction methods pixel scaling methods results conclusions references crosstalk reduction methods air gaps light guide metal mirrors results reference air gaps light guide metal mirrors conclusions references appendices welcome to our project for psych 221 applied vision and image systems engineering taught by professor brian wandell we hope you enjoy reading our reports on optical crosstalk in cmos image sensors ben focused on the effects of pixel scaling on transmission and crosstalk while chris explored several methods for alleviating these problems in future designs please use the links to the left to navigate the website we would like to thank dr peter catrysse for his help in guiding this project
