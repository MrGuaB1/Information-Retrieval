mask version 9 helena dogs demetrius helena and even for that do i love you the more i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you use me as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give me leave unworthy as i am to follow you what worser place can i beg in your love and yet a place of high respect with me than to be used as you use your dog demetrius tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit for i am sick when i do look on thee helena and i am sick when i look not on you demetrius you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity 2.1 202 19 9 helena dogs demetrius when helena speaks of being demetrius's spaniel she physically acts a dog fawning on its master uncritical and unmindful even of being kicked spurned not only does this illustrate the physical quality of the acting in this version but it makes helena more sexually aggressive less passive and aggrieved than in the other versions compare especially bar 17 helena humiliated where demetrius empties his glass over helena's head before dropping his pants and spreading her legs in this sequence when demetrius threatens her with rape helena continues to act the playful puppy again the staging in the round seems to encourage a physical comic style of acting rather than a darker emotional realism we are also made aware of the stage as a purely physical space the stage is actually used like a boxing ring with demetrius being trapped first in one corner and then in the other see also school 13 demetrius hurts helena
