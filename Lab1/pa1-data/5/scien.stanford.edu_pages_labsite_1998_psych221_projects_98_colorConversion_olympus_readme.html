readme for our matlab functions readme for our matlab functions brian m produces brian_spd2rgb using data squishing createstandardcolors m averages the standard colors from the balancedimages directory and saves the result in standardcolors mat deduce_spd2rgb m produces our_spd2rgb using matlab matrix division fwhosindcolorerrors m makes histograms of the color errors in balancedimages and unbalancedimages with reference to standardcolors mat getcolorat m returns the average color in a 5x5 region of the given image surrounding the given pixel getmacbethcolors m extracts the set of standard colors from an image makeplots m creates some nice pictures in the plots directory predict m predicts rgb values from spd and spd2rgb predictall m predicts rgbs for all 113 samples using both the spd2rgb calculated from our approach and that from dr wandell's approach recalculate_all m unbalance all images 5 10 hours unbalance_image m backs out color balancing for the given image based on comparison of the macbeth colors with standardcolors balance 3x3 balance matrices per image balancedimages original data from the camera balancedcolors macbeth values per original image balancedrgbs rgb values of each sample as given by the camera plots plots spectral_radiometer spds unbalancedcolors macbeth values per processed image unbalancedimages images after balancing is backed out unbalancedrgbs sample rgb values after balancing backout
