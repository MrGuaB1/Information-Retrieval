anticausality next up previous print clean next inverse filters up instability previous instability anticausality luckily unstable filters can be made stable as follows 43 equation 43 is a series expansion in 1 z in other words a series about infinity it converges from all the way in to a circle of radius z 1 2 this means that the inverse converges on the unit circle where it must if the coefficients are to be bounded in terms of filters it means that the inverse filter must be one of those filters that responds to future inputs hence although it is not physically realizable it may be used in computer simulation examining equations 42 and 43 we see that the filter 1 1 2z can be expanded into powers of z in at least two different ways which one is correct the theory of complex variables shows that given a particular numerical value of z only one of the sums 42 or 43 will be finite we must use the finite one and since we are interested in fourier series we want the numerical value z 1 for which the first series diverges and the second converges thus the only acceptable filter is anticausal the spectra plotted in figure 11 apply to the anticausal expansion obviously the causal expansion which is unbounded has an infinite spectrum we saw that a polynomial b z of degree n may be factored into n subsystems and that the ordering of subsystems is unimportant suppose we have factored b z and found that some of its roots lie outside the unit circle and some lie inside we first invert the outside roots with equation 41 and then invert the inside roots with equation 43 if there are any roots exactly on the unit circle then we have a special case in which we can try either inverse but neither may give a satisfactory result in practice implied zero division is nature's way of telling us that what we are trying to do cannot be done that way if at all next up previous print clean next inverse filters up instability previous instability stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
