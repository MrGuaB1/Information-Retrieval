ca ion dynamics smith tested and refined his model of intracellular ca ion dynamics during postdoctoral work 1977 1980 with bob zucker at uc berkeley this work included development of early ca measurement techniques to test ca model predictions the importance of cytosolic calcium signaling in the regulation of cell function was first glimpsed in the contexts of muscle excitation contraction coupling vesicular transmitter and hormone secretion and fertilization reactions of sperm and egg with the introduction of optical and imaging techniques it became evident that the importance of calcium as a cell regulator is nearly universal for eukaryotic cells the first computational model for intracellular calcium dynamics developed as part of smith's doctoral research on neuronal oscillation provided the template for most subsequent calcium modeling and also motivated subsequent work by smith and his colleagues to develop means for the quantitative measurement of cytosolic calcium dynamics publications zucker rs and smith sj 1979 effect of tea on light emission from aequorin injected aplysia in neurone soma brain res 164 91 102 smith sj and zucker rs 1980 aequorin response facilitation and intracellular calcium accumulation in molluscan neurones j physiol lond 300 167 196 smith sj 1981 calcium regulation in gastropod nerve cell bodies in molluscan nerve cells eds j koester and jh byrne cold spring harbor laboratory pp 81 91 smith sj macdermott ab and weight ff 1983 detection of intracellular calcium transients in sympathetic neurones using arsenazo iii nature 304 350 352 hoshi t rothlein j and smith sj 1984 facilitation of ca channel currents in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells proc natl acad sci usa 81 5871 5875 boyle mb klein m smith sj and kandel er 1984 serotonin increases intracellular ca transients in voltage clamped sensory neurons of aplysia californica proc natl acad sci usa 81 7642 7646 hoshi t and smith sj 1987 large depolarization induces long openings of voltage dependent calcium channels in adrenal chromaffin cells j neurosci 7 571 580 brehm p lechleiter j smith sj and dunlap k 1989 intercellular signaling as visualized by endogenous calcium dependent bioluminescence neuron 3 191 198 model of ca dynamics in neuronal cell body smith 1977
