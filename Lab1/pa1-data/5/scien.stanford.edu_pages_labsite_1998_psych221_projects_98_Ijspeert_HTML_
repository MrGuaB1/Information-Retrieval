matlab implementation of psf mtf and lsf the matlab implementation of psf mtf and lsf designed for psychology221 programmed by eric schmitt psych221 ee362 in 1991 jk ijspeert et al proposed a mathematically simple formula that in its 3 related forms accurately modeled the behavior of the pointspread function psf the linespread function lsf and the modulation transfer function mtf though mathematically simple these new functions rely on a myriad of constants and prefactors by designing components using these prefactors ijespeert was able to elegantly model them while also taking into consideration parameters such as eye pigmentation age and pupil size however the constants and prefactors on which the new functions are built upon are very cumbersome and complex calculating mtfs psfs and lsfs would take ages without software implementation of ijspeert's ideas this project takes the next logical step in the process it is a full fully decomposed matlab implementation of all equations in the ijspeert paper allowing easy calculation of the mtf psf and lsf while allowing for optional variables for pupil diameter age and pigmentation run the demo about the project about the author
