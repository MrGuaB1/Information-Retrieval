n3 workshop nnin special workshop nanotechnology as an enabler for neuroscience neuroengineering and neural prostheses nano for n 3 this workshop was help on dec 11 12 2008 agenda and presentation materials are posted here workshop organizers professor krishna shenoy and professor yoshio nishi goals of the workshop neural prostheses aim to help improve the quality of life for patients suffering from neurological disease and injury they function by translating electrical signals from the brain eg action potentials local field potentials ecogs eegs into control signals for guiding assistive devices despite considerable progress in recent years the field actively continues to pursue 1 increased sensor lifetime and 2 increased system performance so that the anticipated quality of life improvements will clearly outweigh potential surgical risks despite ongoing efforts in recent years neither sensor lifetime nor system performance have grown at a rate necessary to dramatically enable the widespread clinical translation of these systems mems based electrode arrays have had functional lifetimes of approximately one year without substantial improvement while flexible substrate and pharmacological agent delivery through micro fluidic channels appears promising there is considerable interest in understanding what nano structured electrical and or optical sensors which reside at the size scale of neurons 1 um may enable similarly system performance relies on massively parallel measurement of neural signals and mems based measurement has remained at roughly 100 200 neurons for the past decade there is considerable interest in understanding what massively parallel nano structured electrical and or optical sensors which could provide both the high density measurements within one brain neural area and measurement from multiple brain areas separated by many centimeters may provide advances in both of these areas are crucial for the sustained advancement of both basic systems neuroscience which aims to provide fundamental scientific understanding of complex nervous systems and may generate biologically inspired computational principles for next generation electronic computational architectures as well as more applied neuroengineering which aims to build core technology the major goals of the workshop are to build bridges and promote collaborations between the neuroscience neuroengineering neural prosthesis and nanotechnology sensor communities to identify limitations in current neural measurement technologies and critical needs for basic neuroscience neuroengineering and clinical neural prostheses to identify potential solutions to these needs based on recent progress in nano and micro technology to identify how nnin can best leverage its tools user base and staff expertise to enable these goals agenda presentations and research links back to top home sitemap search stanford nanofabrication facility webmaestro snf stanford edu last modified 02 04 2009
