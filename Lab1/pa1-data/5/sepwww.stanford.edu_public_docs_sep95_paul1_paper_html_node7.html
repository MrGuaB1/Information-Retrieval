gaussian velocity anomaly previous up next print clean next the seg eage salt model up examples previous examples gaussian velocity anomaly the gaussian velocity anomaly has a magnitude of 2000 m s and is placed in a medium of constant 3000 m s velocity the center of the anomaly is at x 6000 m and z 1000 m figure 3 the source is on the surface directly above the velocity anomaly we selected this model because it leads to strong bending of the rays and therefore to multiple wave arrivals at depths below the anomaly figure 4 gauss velocity figure 3 a gaussian negative velocity anomaly with the center at x 6000 m and z 1000 m the background velocity is 3000 m s the maximum velocity anomaly is 2000 m s view burn build edit restore an interesting zone that displays clear multiple arrivals is at the depth of 1700 m the times interpolated at this depth are displayed in figure 5 we have obtained a triplication that confirms our expectations and validates our implementation gauss velr figure 4 the rays traced on the gaussian velocity model with the paraxial ray tracing method the shot point is at x 6000 m and z 0 m the rays are shot from 45 to 45 degrees in steps of 1 degree where the vertical is defined to be at 0 degrees view burn build edit restore gauss times figure 5 multiple arrival traveltimes computed at depth 1700 m in the gaussian anomaly model view burn build edit restore previous up next print clean next the seg eage salt model up examples previous examples stanford exploration project 10 9 1997
