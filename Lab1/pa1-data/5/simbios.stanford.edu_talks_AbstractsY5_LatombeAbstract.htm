latombe abstract simbios return to simbios talks simbios talk by jc latombe stanford university june 3 2009 title computational tools to study protein low frequency motions abstract folded proteins are not rigid objects their motions occur at many different frequencies but the low frequency motions are often the most pertinent for the protein functions binding in this talk i will review several computational tools that we are developing to efficiently model analyze and predict protein low frequency motions i will present past and ongoing work along three different lines of research 1 i will present new techniques to determine structural heterogeneity in folded proteins from x ray crystallography data these techniques produce a small collection of conformers discrete sub states that best explain a given electron density map rather than a unique average conformer with large harmonic thermal noise 2 i will describe geometric kinematic tools to efficiently sample conformations of folded proteins or protein fragments i will illustrate their application to the recognition of calcium binding loop conformations 3 finally i will discuss the generation of hidden markov models to compactly represent the long timescale dynamics of proteins among meta stable states in particular i will discuss tools to score such models feedback collaborations career administration contact
