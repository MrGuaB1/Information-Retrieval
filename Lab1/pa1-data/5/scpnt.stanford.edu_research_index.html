scpnt research research summary technical focus stanford leadership research summary the scpnt works with the federal aviation administration us navy us air force arinc nasa and us coast guard to pioneer systems that augment the global positioning system gps and galileo these augmentations broadcast differential corrections to improve accuracy provide error bounds in real time and or mitigate radio frequency interference specific projects include the wide area augmentation system waas already supports millions of land and marine users across north america it became operational for aviation in july of 2003 the local area augmentation system laas will eventually support automatic landings at high traffic hub airports the joint precision approach and landing system jpals will support aircraft landings on aircraft carriers and military air fields technologies that address the vulnerability of satellite navigation to radio frequency interference are of interest these include the integration of existing terrestrial radio navigation systems like loran now called enhanced loran or eloran the lab is also very active in the investigation of software receivers that integrate inertial navigation and adaptive antennas earlier the laboratory worked with the us coast guard to design a medium frequency radio system to broadcast differential corrections to maritime users of gps today this system covers much of the world's coastline and provides differential gps data to 1.5 million users top people research membership contacts publications news & events pnt symposium home 2005 stanford university site design academic web pages
