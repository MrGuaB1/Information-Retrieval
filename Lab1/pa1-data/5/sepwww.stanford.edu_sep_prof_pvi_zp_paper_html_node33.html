impedance filters next up previous print clean next about this document up z plane causality and feedback previous my favorite wavelet impedance filters impedance filters are a special class of minimum phase filters that model energy conserving devices and media the real part of the fourier transform of an impedance filter is positive impedances play a basic role in mathematical physics there are simple ways of making complicated mechanical systems from simple ones and corresponding mathematical rules allow construction of complicated impedances from simple ones also impedances can be helpful in stabilizing numerical calculations logically a chapter on impedance filters belongs here but i have little to add to what is already found in fgdp and iei fgdp describes the impedance concept in sampled time and its relation to special matrices called toeplitz matrices iei describes impedances in general as well as their role in physical modeling and imaging with the wave equation next up previous print clean next about this document up z plane causality and feedback previous my favorite wavelet stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
