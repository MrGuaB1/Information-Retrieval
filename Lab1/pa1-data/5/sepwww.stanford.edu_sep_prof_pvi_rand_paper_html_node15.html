sample mean next up previous print clean next variance of the sample up time statistical resolution previous probability and independence sample mean now let x t be a time series made up of identically distributed random numbers m x and do not depend on time let us also suppose that they are independently chosen this means in particular that for any different times t and s 19 suppose we have a sample of n points of x t and are trying to determine the value of m x we could make an estimate of the mean m x with the formula 20 a somewhat more elaborate method of estimating the mean would be to take a weighted average let w t define a set of weights normalized so that 21 with these weights the more elaborate estimate of the mean is 22 actually 20 is just a special case of 22 in 20 the weights are w t 1 n further the weights could be convolved on the random time series to compute local averages of this time series thus smoothing it the weights are simply a filter response where the filter coefficients happen to be positive and cluster together figure 6 shows an example a random walk function with itself smoothed locally walk figure 6 random walk and itself smoothed and shifted downward view next up previous print clean next variance of the sample up time statistical resolution previous probability and independence stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
