uncertainty analysis in complex multi physics applications uncertainty analysis in complex multi physics applications july 25 26 2008 stanford university stanford ca despite the considerable success of computer simulation technology in science and engineering it remains difficult to construct objective confidence bounds on the numerical predictions one of the challenges is that in realistic systems only limited information is available to characterize the operating conditions and approximations are typically used to represent complex physical phenomena this is in stark contrast to the usual assumptions in current computational model that typically requires well defined deterministic inputs the large increase in computational resource expected during the next decade provides an exceptional opportunity to build novel computational methodologies that incorporate uncertainty quantification algorithms the scope of this two day workshop is to bring together experts in the blooming field of uncertainty analysis for an open informal discussion about the most recent research trends the plan is to organize the contributions in three main areas of interest identification of the uncertainties formulation of the boundary conditions approximations in the physical models estimation of numerical discretization errors pdf constructions etc uncertainty propagation methods for time dependent problems model reduction and curse of dimensionality intrusive vs non intrusive approaches adjoint and adjoint free approaches etc certification a posteriori error estimates validation metrics confidence intervals etc it is expected that the contributions will cover a vast range of application areas and therefore the focus of the workshop is on methodologies and algorithms participants will be required to provide written notes of their contributions to be published as proceedings of the workshop the workshop is sponsored by the new doe psaap predictive science accademic alliance program center recently established at stanford university preliminary agenda list of participants workshop location and map workshop logistics hotels transportation parking contact info gianluca iaccarino icme & mechanical engineering jops stanford edu george papanicolaou icme & mathematics papanico math stanford edu alireza doostan mechanical engineering doostan stanford edu register to attend the workshop first name middle name last name affiliation mailing address 1 mailing address 2 mailing address 2 email stanford university all rights reserved stanford ca 94305 650 723 2300 terms of use copyright complaints
