gabor's proof of the uncertainty principle next up previous print clean next my rise time form of up time frequency resolution previous the uncertainty principle in gabor's proof of the uncertainty principle although it is easy to verify the uncertainty principle in many special cases it is not easy to deduce it the difficulty begins from finding a definition of the width of a function that leads to a tractable analysis one possible definition uses a second moment that is is defined by 2 the spectral bandwidth is defined likewise with these definitions dennis gabor prepared a widely reproduced proof i will omit his proof here it is not an easy proof it is widely available and the definition 2 seems inappropriate for a function we often use the sinc function ie the ft of a step function since the sinc function drops off as t 1 its width defined with 2 is infinity which is unlike the more human measure of width the distance to the first axis crossing next up previous print clean next my rise time form of up time frequency resolution previous the uncertainty principle in stanford exploration project 3 1 2001
