retirement saving in a steady state world an idea i got from thoughtful but radical environmental web sites is that we have made the transition to a steady state world or worse when the petroleum depletion becomes more rapid in a steady state world compounding interest is impossible mathematically no part can grow exponentially while the whole itself does not investment interest can no more than match the currency debasement inflation assuming we actually are in a steady state world strongly affects one's retirement savings strategy a simplified model illustrates the consequences for you breaking an adult life into four 15 year parts the boundaries of the four parts are at ages 25 40 55 70 85 the first three parts are the saving parts and the last part the retirement part assuming constant income throughout in the first three parts you save 1 4 of your income leaving 3 4 to spend that leaves you the same 3 4 for your retirement years ie constant spending throughout life wow i am really lucky with my employer's contribution i ve only saved 15 year plus social security maybe 11 total equal 26 year but i ve lived in an expanding economy so my stock plan actually grew in real dollars
