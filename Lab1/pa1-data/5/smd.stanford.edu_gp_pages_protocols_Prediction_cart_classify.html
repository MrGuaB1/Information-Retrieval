cart class prediction classify unknown sample cart class prediction classify unknown sample protocols to evaluate an existing classification and regression trees cart classifier run the cart module with the classifier model file and a data set containing the unknown samples before you begin classifying an unknown sample requires a cart model file that contains the cart classifier example file all_aml_train cart model a gene expression data set containing the unknown samples gct or res file that contains gene expression data example file all_aml_test gct cls file that identifies the class of each sample in the gene expression data as unknown example file all_aml_test_unknown cls learn more file formats step 1 cart to classify unknown samples using a previously built cart classifier run the cart module use the model file parameter to specify the classifier cart model and the test filename and test class filename parameters to specify the data set containing the unknown samples the module creates a prediction results file pred odf that lists each sample with its actual class unknown and its predicted class open cart open cart with example data learn more cart step 2 view results to view the prediction results file pred odf use the predictionresultsviewer module the viewer lists each sample with its actual class unknown and its predicted class open predictionresultsviewer open predictionresultsviewer with example data considerations ignore the actual class which was unknown ignore the error rates which are designed to evaluate the class predictor against known data learn more predictionresultsviewer
