led multispectral imaging led multispectral imaging reconstruction of reflectance spectra march 21 2008 stanford university elza john david lau stephanie leung our full report is in pdf form here the matlab code data and plots are zipped here 10mb condensed abstract cameras can accurately reproduce color that humans interpret across scenes but the actual reflectance spectra of the object cannot be accurately reconstructed with only 3 color channels we explore using multiple leds as illuminants and various methods of reconstructing reflectance spectra of skin and other objects
