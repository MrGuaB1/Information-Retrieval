frequency chain qwiki frequency chain from qwiki jump to navigation search this technique has been superseded by optical frequency combs a frequency chain is used to generate a high frequency optical infrared terahertz etc reference from a precision rf source ie a cesium atomic clock a frequency chain operates by successively doubling the rf reference through various nonlinear processes the high frequency signal of interest is compared to the reference generated by the frequency doubling chain generating a frequency chain is extremely cumbersome and the resulting chain can be tuned only over an extremely limited range of frequencies these problems have been overcome with optical frequency combs retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php frequency chain categories concept lab lore views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 5 october 2005 at 06 14 this page has been accessed 8705 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
