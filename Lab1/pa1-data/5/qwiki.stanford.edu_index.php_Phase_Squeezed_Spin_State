phase squeezed spin state qwiki phase squeezed spin state from qwiki jump to navigation search phase squeezed spin states pss are collective spin states in the canonical measurement scheme it is sensible for cyclic variables to define uncertainty is in terms of the sharpness as long as is oriented in the x direction s is real and positive and it is always less than 1 unlike the variance the sharpness respects the periodicity of the phase phi a state with a s close to 1 has a low phase uncertainty and vice versa for such states the variance of is given by the approximate formula provided that  0 is not near the peak of p  another variance can be defined using s the holevo variance s 2 1 but for our purposes it is simpler to take a quantity linear in s now that we have a measure for phase uncertainty we can define a new figure of merit appropriate to a single shot phase estimate with no prior information  2 4j 1 s this is the phase squeezing parameter for spin states this measure has for coherent states cf with spin squeezed state and phase squeezing implies entanglement similar measures have been considered before another measure would be to scale this equation with respect to the coherent state ie retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php phase_squeezed_spin_state categories concept quantum mechanics quantum information quantum optics quantum state views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 7 september 2005 at 01 09 this page has been accessed 4842 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
