thermal modeling of mars coring thermal model for analysis and control of drilling in icy formations on mars timothy szwarc advisors scott hubbard and richard christensen project description the martian environment makes producing and extracting core samples from rock and soil a unique challenge that differs greatly from drilling on earth low ambient temperatures and pressures coupled with the presence of ice make the possibility of ice adhering and permanently lodging a bit in place a potentially disastrous scenario my research aims to model the heat generation and transport in a coring operation and produce schedules for martian drilling operations which will allow for cores to be efficiently produced while the risk of ice adhesion is mitigated student bio ms aeronautics & astronautics stanford university 2009 bs mechanical engineering cornell university 2008 tim is a 3rd year phd candidate in stanford university's department of aeronautics and astronautics outside of mars exploration his interests include surfing hiking and marine aquariums tim is an avid fan of formula 1 racing and football publications talks mars sample return new technology to bring home the red planet presentation to bucknell university 30 august 2010 thermal model for analysis and control of drilling in icy formations on mars presentation at international astronautical congress 2011 cape town south africa 6 october 2011 home people research high regression rate fuels 2 phase injectors and stability self pressurizing propellant dynamics catalysis of n 2 o decomposition energy recovery via n 2 o decomposition microwave rockets thermal modeling of mars coring pinpoint landing commercial space courses resources
