concludion conclusions we have given an overview of various watermarking techniques utilizing both spread spectrum and sub band decomposition the use of coherent and blind detection was also emphasized attacks have been classified into categories according to their intensions and goals results after various attacks are provided to test the robustness of the viewed techniques finally a comparison between these techniques according to their response after attaches is presented there will always be a tradeoff in watermark embedding by which we mean tradeoff between robustness of the watermark verses the degradation of the image at some point the strength of the watermark will cause the image to be degraded to a point which will not be acceptable depending on the technique used for watermarking whether in spatial or frequency domain the watermarked image showed in general robustness to the attacks of the same domain and weakness to the attacks in the opposite domain nakamura mentions these results in his work 6 and concludes that there is no method that will be robust in both domains and that applying hybrid watermarking schemes will have worse results back to top
