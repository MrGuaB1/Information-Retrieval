high regression rate fuels high regression rate fuels ashley chandler advisors brian cantwell and scott hubbard high regression rate hybrid fuels such as paraffin have made it possible to design single port hybrid rockets as replacements for more conventional solid or liquid options during combustion these fuels form a melt layer on the surface of the solid grain the oxidizer imposes a shear force on the fuel and liquid droplets are entrained into the flow increasing the overall mass transfer of the hybrid ashley is currently building a system to visualize this mechanism which responsible for the increased burning rates of paraffin fuels she has also worked on a paraffin based hybrid design for a mars ascent vehicle mav as part of a mars sample return campaign the two stage hybrid mav used a single port 60 paraffin 40 aluminum fuel grain and nytrox a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen as the oxidizer ashley is also looking at other applications for hybrid rockets in solar system exploration she is currently focused on hybrids as orbit insertion motors home people research high regression rate fuels 2 phase injectors and stability self pressurizing propellant dynamics catalysis of n 2 o decomposition energy recovery via n 2 o decomposition microwave rockets thermal modeling of mars coring pinpoint landing commercial space courses resources
