psych 221 final project psych 221 final project l1 & l2 norm home introduction mission strategy approach interpolation filtering image inpainting convex metrics s cielab l1 & l2 norm computation time results conclusions about us source code references l1 & l2 norm l2 norm l2 norm measures the euclidian distance between the pixels of the original and the corrected image formula for the l2 norm is img_original _i img_corrected_i 2 where the summation index i goes over all the pixels in the image a noteworthy feature of l2 norm is that the contribution of a specific pixel grows quadratically as its distance to the corresponding pixel grows hence l2 norm punishes much more for bigger distances than l1 norm l1 norm norm measures the absolute distance between the pixels of the original and the corrected image formula for the l1 norm is abs img_original _i img_corrected_i where the summation index i goes over all the pixels in the image unlike in l2 norm the contribution of a distance between two pixels grows linearly with the distance so l1 norm punishes relatively more for smaller distances than l2 norm
