h13 section 2 page 1 mehran sahami handout 15 cs 106a october 8 2007 section handout 2 simple java based on a handout by eric roberts 1 the fibonacci sequence in the 13th century the italian mathematician leonardo fibonacci as a way to explain the geometic growth of a population of rabbits devised a mathematical sequence that now bears his name the first two terms in this sequence fib 0 and fib 1 are 0 and 1 and every subsequent term is the sum of the preceding two thus the first several terms in the fibonacci sequence look like this fib 0 0 fib 1 1 fib 2 1 0 1 fib 3 2 1 1 fib 4 3 1 2 fib 5 5 2 3 write a program that displays the terms in the fibonacci sequence starting with fib 0 and continuing as long as the terms are less than 10000 thus your program should produce the following sample run this program continues as long as the value of the term is less than the maximum value so that the loop construct you need is a while presumably with a header line that looks like this while term max_term_value note that the maximum term value is specified using a named constant page 2 2 2 drawing a face your job is to draw a robot looking face like the one shown in the following sample run this simple face consists of four parts a head two eyes and a mouth which are arranged as follows the head the head is a big rectangle whose dimensions are given by the named constants head_width and head_height the interior of the head is gray although it should be framed in black the eyes the eyes should be cricles whose radius in pixels is given by the named constant eye_radius the centers of the eyes should be set horizontally a quarter of the width of the head in from either edge and one quarter of the distance down from the top of the head the eyes are yellow the mouth the mouth should be centered with respect to the head in the x dimension and one quarter of the distance up from the bottom of the head in the y dimension the dimensions of the mouth are given by the named constants mouth_width and mouth_height the mouth is white finally the robot face should be centered in the graphics window
