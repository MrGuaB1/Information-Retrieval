abstract of definition of dense random packing abstract of the paper definition of dense random packing a simple definition of dense random packing for equal rigid spheres is presented and the consequences of this definition are explored according to this definition dense random packing occurs at the minimum packing fraction eta 1 porosity for which a convenient estimate of the nearest neighbor radius equals the diameter of the spheres using the radial distribution function at more dilute concentrations to calculate such nearest neighbor radii lower bounds on the critical packing fraction are obtained and the value of eta is estimated by extrapolation dense random packing is predicted to occur for eta 0.64 0.02 in three dimensions and eta 0.82 0.02 in two dimensions both of these predictions are consistent with the available experimental data electronic copies of this paper are not available
