welcome to psb 2013 welcome psb 2013 the pacific symposium on biocomputing psb 2013 is an international multidisciplinary conference for the presentation and discussion of current research in the theory and application of computational methods in problems of biological significance papers and presentations are rigorously peer reviewed and are published in an archival proceedings volume psb 2013 will be held january 3 7 2013 at the fairmont orchid on the big island of hawaii tutorials will be offered prior to the start of the conference psb 2013 will bring together top researchers from the us the asian pacific nations and around the world to exchange research results and address open issues in all aspects of computational biology psb is a forum for the presentation of work in databases algorithms interfaces visualization modeling and other computational methods as applied to biological problems with emphasis on applications in data rich areas of molecular biology the psb has been designed to be responsive to the need for critical mass in sub disciplines within biocomputing for that reason it is the only meeting whose sessions are defined dynamically each year in response to specific proposals psb sessions are organized by leaders in the emerging areas and targeted to provide a forum for publication and discussion of research in biocomputing's hot topics in this way psb provides an early forum for serious examination of emerging methods and approaches in this rapidly changing field online registration will open in august back to the main psb page updated january 31 2012
