quantum risk sensitive optimal control qwiki quantum risk sensitive optimal control from qwiki jump to navigation search optimal control involves defining a cost function for a system and then mathematically finding the control process that minimizes that cost function risk sensitive optimal control involves defining a different cost function so that the control process displays robust properties for example it may be disireable to find a control process that is less sensitive to modelling errors one can describe a risk sensitive control as one that provides good performance under nominal conditions and acceptable otherwise for risk sensitive optimal control of a quantum system a quantum cost needs to be defined here we take c 1 t and c 2 t as the usual cost operator and usual terminal cost operator respectively a natural definition of a quantum risk sensitive cost is given by matt james 1 as where we define r t as the solution to the operator differential equation a solution to the equation for r t can formally be written as 1 mr james a quantum langevin formulation of rish sensitive optimal control j opt b v 7 p 198 2005 retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php quantum_risk sensitive_optimal_control categories control theory concept views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 18 june 2006 at 14 45 this page has been accessed 3888 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
