sing datasets home bio research teaching software datasets patent sing datasets this page has the datasets from our measurements of both 802.15 4 and 802.11 testbeds please feel free to download and use them you are also welcome to use our swat tool to measure your own testbed if you do use our datasets please do mention in your paper that you used sing datasets experiments we have run two kinds of experiments burst and round robin in the burst experiments nodes one at a time send a burst of packets in the round robin case every node gets to send one packet before any node sends the next packet simply put in burst nodes take turn in sending bursts while in round robin they take turn in sending every packet we have several datasets for these two types of experiments with different parameter values the parameters are inter packet interval ipi number of packets broadcast or unicast channel number of nodes and transmission power level datasets mirage 802.15 4 burst channel 26 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 100k date 18 jul 07 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 50k date 08 dec 08 tx power 3 ipi 10ms no of packets 10k date 03 mar 09 tx power 7 ipi 10ms no of packets 10k date 20 apr 09 tx power 7 ipi 10ms no of packets 50k date 05 dec 08 mirage 802.15 4 burst channel 16 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 100k date 24 jun 07 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 50k date 09 dec 08 tx power 3 ipi 10ms no of packets 50k date 02 mar 09 tx power 7 ipi 10ms no of packets 10k date 22 apr 09 tx power 7 ipi 10ms no of packets 50k date 05 dec 08 mirage 802.15 4 burst channel variable tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 200 date 10 apr 08 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 200 date 18 sep 07 mirage 802.15 4 round robin channel 11 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 800 date 06 feb 06 mirage 802.15 4 round robin channel 26 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 800 date 07 feb 06 attenuator 802.15 4 burst channel 26 tx power 3 ipi 10ms no of packets 100 date 15 jul 07 omega 802.15 4 burst channel variable tx power var ipi var no of packets var date 28 apr 06 omega 802.15 4 round robin channel variable tx power var ipi var no of packets var date 28 apr 06 motelab 802.15 4 burst channel 26 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 10k date 13 aug 09 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 10k date 21 aug 09 motelab 802.15 4 burst channel 16 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 10k date 15 aug 09 tx power 31 ipi 10ms no of packets 10k date 22 aug 09 swan 802.11 burst channel 1 rate 5.5 mbps tx power 11 ipi 5ms no of packets 50k date 29 dec 08 rate 5.5 mbps tx power 11 ipi 5ms no of packets 50k date 29 dec 08 rate 5.5 mbps tx power 11 ipi 5ms no of packets 50k date 29 dec 08 rate 11mbps tx power 22 ipi 5ms no of packets 50k date 30 dec 08 rate 11mbps tx power 22 ipi 5ms no of packets 50k date 30 dec 08 rate 11mbps tx power 22 ipi 5ms no of packets 50k date 31 dec 08 rate 1mbps tx power 2 ipi 15ms no of packets 50k date 26 dec 08 rate 1mbps tx power 2 ipi 15ms no of packets 50k date 25 dec 08 rate 1mbps tx power 2 ipi 15ms no of packets 50k date 27 dec 08 rate 2mbps tx power 4 ipi 10ms no of packets 50k date 28 dec 08 rate 2mbps tx power 4 ipi 10ms no of packets 50k date 27 dec 08 rate 2mbps tx power 4 ipi 10ms no of packets 50k date 28 dec 08 shuttle 802.11 burst channel 1 rate 11mbps tx power 22 ipi 5ms no of packets 50k date 09 jun 09 rate 11mbps tx power 22 ipi 5ms no of packets 50k date 10 jun 09 rate 11mbps tx power 22 ipi 5ms no of packets 50k date 11 jun 09 rate 1mbps tx power 2 ipi 15ms no of packets 50k date 09 jun 09 rate 1mbps tx power 2 ipi 15ms no of packets 50k date 10 jun 09 rate 1mbps tx power 2 ipi 15ms no of packets 50k date 11 jun 09 page generated 2010 03 01 22 00 48 pst by jemdoc
