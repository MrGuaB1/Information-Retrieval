vertical exaggeration next up previous print clean next horizontally moving waves up travel time depth previous travel time depth vertical exaggeration the first task in interpretation of seismic data is to figure out the approximate numerical value of the vertical exaggeration the vertical exaggeration is 2 v because it is the ratio of the apparant slope to the actual slope where since the velocity generally increases with depth the vertical exaggeration generally decreases with depth for velocity stratified media the time to depth conversion formula is 2 1 next up previous print clean next horizontally moving waves up travel time depth previous travel time depth stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
