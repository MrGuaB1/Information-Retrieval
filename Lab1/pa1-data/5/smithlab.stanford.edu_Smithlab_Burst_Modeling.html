burst modeling tritonia diomedia stephen j smith's doctoral research at the university of washington 1973 1977 resulted in the first ionic conductance based simulation of neuronal burst firing this simulation was based on six variable conductance components as measured under voltage clamp by stuart thompson and included the first computational models of intracellular ca dynamics and of ca dependent potassium current publications smith sj and thompson sh 1987 slow membrane currents in bursting pace maker neurones of tritonia j physiol lond 382 425 448 thompson s smith sj and johnson jw 1986 slow outward tail currents in molluscan bursting pacemaker neurons two components differing in temperature sensitivity j neurosci 6 3169 3176 smith sj 1981 calcium regulation in gastropod nerve cell bodies in molluscan nerve cells eds j koester and jh byrne cold spring harbor laboratory pp 81 91 smith sj 1981 excitability of gatropod neurons neurosci res prog bull 119 286 291 adams dj smith sj and thompson sh 1980 ionic currents in molluscan soma ann rev neurosci 3 141 167 smith sj and zucker rs 1980 aequorin response facilitation and intracellular calcium accumulation in molluscan neurones j physiol lond 300 167 196 zucker rs and smith sj 1979 effect of tea on light emission from aequorin injected aplysia in neurone soma brain res 164 91 102 patridge ld thompson sh smith sj and connor ja 1979 current voltage relationships of repetitively firing neurons brain res 164 69 79 thompson sh and smith sj 1976 depolarizing afterpotentials and burst production in molluscan pacemaker neurons j neurophysiol 39 153 161
