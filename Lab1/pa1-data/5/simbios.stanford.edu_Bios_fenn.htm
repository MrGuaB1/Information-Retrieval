tim fenn simbios back to people tim fenn my research interests are at the interface of x ray crystallography and state of the art molecular physics part of my work with dr axel brunger and dr vijay pande involved investigating the utility of a modern polarizable atomic multipole force field in crystallographic x ray and neutron refinement and found that the resultant models offer a richer description versus previous methods for example hydrogen atoms are treated explicitly during refinement by electrostatics providing analyses of dna hydration enzyme function and secondary structure energetics in the framework of measured observables that were previously not possible as a simbios postdoc i am working with dr vijay pande to combine molecular dynamics and crystallographic data in a rigorous bayesian framework protein function often involves subtle conformational changes and or dynamics that can not be modeled with traditional crystallographic techniques likewise molecular dynamics trajectories are often performed in the absence of experimental information the combination of these will be used to answer questions of biological significance and further our understanding of the coupling between structure physics and function when not in lab i enjoy spending my time baking bread cooking yummy food and contributing to free software projects such as fedora linux e mail fenn stanford edu feedback collaborations career resources administration contact
