13 conclusions page 1 convex optimization boyd & vandenberghe 13 conclusions main ideas of the course importance of modeling in optimization 13 1 page 2 modeling mathematical optimization problems in engineering design data analysis and statistics economics management can often be expressed as mathematical optimization problems techniques exist to take into account multiple objectives or uncertainty in the data tractability roughly speaking tractability in optimization requires convexity algorithms for nonconvex optimization find local suboptimal solutions or are very expensive surprisingly many applications can be formulated as convex problems conclusions 13 2 page 3 theoretical consequences of convexity local optima are global extensive duality theory systematic way of deriving lower bounds on optimal value necessary and sufficient optimality conditions certificates of infeasibility sensitivity analysis solution methods with polynomial worst case complexity theory with self concordance conclusions 13 3 page 4 practical consequences of convexity most convex problems can be solved globally and efficiently interior point methods require 20 80 steps in practice basic algorithms eg newton barrier method are easy to implement and work well for small and medium size problems larger problems if structure is exploited more and more high quality implementations of advanced algorithms and modeling tools are becoming available high level modeling tools like cvx ease modeling and problem specification conclusions 13 4 page 5 how to use convex optimization to use convex optimization in some applied context use rapid prototyping approximate modeling start with simple models small problem instances inefficient solution methods if you don t like the results no need to expend further effort on more accurate models or efficient algorithms work out simplify and interpret optimality conditions and dual even if the problem is quite nonconvex you can use convex optimization in subproblems eg to find search direction by repeatedly forming and solving a convex approximation at the current point conclusions 13 5 page 6 further topics some topics we didn t cover methods for very large scale problems subgradient calculus convex analysis localization subgradient and related methods distributed convex optimization applications that build on or use convex optimization these will be in ee364b next quarter conclusions 13 6
