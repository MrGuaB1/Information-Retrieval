how to divide noisy signals next up previous print clean next dividing by zero smoothly up univariate problems previous references how to divide noisy signals another univariate statistical problem arises in fourier analysis where we seek a best answer at each frequency then combine all the frequencies to get a best signal thus emerges a wide family of interesting and useful applications however fourier analysis first requires us to introduce complex numbers into statistical estimation multiplication in the fourier domain is convolution in the time domain fourier domain division is time domain deconvolution in chapter we encountered the polynomial division feedback operation x z y z f z this division is challenging when f has observational error by switching from the z domain to the domain we avoid needing to know if f is minimum phase the domain has pitfalls too however we may find for some real that vanishes so we cannot divide by that f failure erupts if zero division occurs more insidious are the poor results we obtain when zero division is avoided by a near miss dividing by zero smoothly damped solution example of deconvolution with a known wavelet deconvolution with an unknown filter explicit model for noise a self fulfilling prophecy next up previous print clean next dividing by zero smoothly up univariate problems previous references stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
