stanford university cs 223 b introduction to computer vision stanford university cs 223 b introduction to computer vision sebastian thrun and gary bradski project p15 segmentation and classification of diffusion tensor images project goal this project involves using segmentation and classification algorithms to identify major nerve bundles in the brain we begin with mr data that measures the principal direction of water diffusion in each smallish 2x2x2 mm voxel these are called diffusion tensor images dti when water is within a major fiber bundle it tends to diffuse along the main path of the fiber bundle figure 1 one possible rendering of a slice of a diffusion tensor image of the brain here each voxel tensor is mapped to a scalar value representing diffusivity at present we can visualize the diffusion direction but there is still a need for algorithms to group the data into the known major bundles and to automatically find similar bundles in different people these are both tasks that we would like to do routinely project scope this project involves interfacing with prof brian wandell of stanford's vision science and neuroimaging group and with dr robert dougherty of the stanford institute for reading and learning tasks the project will be accomplished through the following tasks task 1 gain access to diffusion tensor image data task 2 devise an efficient and robust algorithm for the segmentation of dti data into known major bundles of fibers task 3 given a dataset of dti images devise an algorithm to classify similar bundles in different images project status dan merget and fiona wei ling loke point of contact daniel russakoff midterm report submitted final report submitted cs 223b introduction to computer vision stanford university course overview announcements time and location course materials schedule instructors assignments projects policies links
