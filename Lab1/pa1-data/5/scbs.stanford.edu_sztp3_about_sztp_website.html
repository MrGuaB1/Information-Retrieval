sztp website resources help about this site purposes as the work of the soto zen text project proceeds texts of its published translations will be made available to the public on this site kindly provided us by the ho center for buddhist studies at stanford in putting our work in electronic form here we hope not only to make the published translations more readily available but also to supplement the printed versions with additional annotation and other resources of the project in addition we hope to test our work on readers here and seek their reactions thus the site is intended to be interactive and we encourage readers responses to the material and suggestions on how we might improve our work building the site the present site is a first step in the development of what we hope will eventually be a complete data base of the texts translations and annotations of the project at this stage the design remains quite simple in subsequent versions we plan to include extensive notes and glossaries to many of the translations with full diacritics and chinese graphs as well as more convenient search and download functions updates since the site will grow with the project visitors should check periodically for updates announced on the home page contacts to contact the editors e mail carl bielefeldt at carl leland stanford edu or griffith foulk at gfoulk slc edu
