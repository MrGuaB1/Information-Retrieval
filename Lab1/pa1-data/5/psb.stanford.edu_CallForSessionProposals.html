call for session proposals call for session proposals psb 2013 this is an invitation to submit proposals for sessions for the 18th pacific symposium on biocomputing psb 2013 to be held january 3 7 2013 note date change on the kohala coast the big island of hawaii psb will bring together top researchers from the us the asian pacific nations and around the world to exchange research for the presentation of work in databases algorithms interfaces natural language processing modeling and other computational methods as applied to biological problems with emphasis on applications in data rich areas of molecular biology psb has been designed to be responsive to the need for critical mass in sub disciplines within biocomputing for that reason it is the only meeting whose sessions are defined dynamically each year in response to specific proposals psb sessions are organized by leaders in the emerging areas and targeted to provide a forum for publication and discussion of research in biocomputing's hot topics in this way psb provides an early forum for serious examination of emerging methods and approaches in this rapidly changing field proposals for such sessions are hereby solicited a session's proposal should identify a coherent topic that can be addressed by 3 to 12 papers for example a session might bring together papers on alternative approaches to a particular biological question or it might examine the applications of a particular technology in a variety of biological areas a sample of more than 20 different decisions at previous psb meetings have included identification of aberrant pathway and network activity from high throughput data intrinsically disordered proteins analysis prediction simulation and biology microbiome studies analytical tools and techniques modeling host pathogen interactions computational biology and bioinformatics for infectious disease research personalized medicine from genotypes and molecular phenotypes towards computed therapy text and knowledge mining for pharmacogenomics genotype phenotype drug relationships a major goal of psb is to create productive interaction among the rather different research cultures of computer science and biology recognizing that many in the computational community believe the value of a meeting depends on the quality of its review process every full manuscript submitted to psb is reviewed by at least two anonymous reviewers as well as the session organizers and meeting chairs accepted papers are distributed in a proceedings volume at the meeting and are indexed in medline and other bibliographic databases however we also recognize that many potential participants particularly from the biological community do not choose to submit full papers to conferences even with assurance of availability and broad indexing therefore psb also includes a separate open submission abstract book and open poster presentations in which any registrant can present research responsibilities of a session chair as a proposer of an accepted session you will become the session chair the chair's primary responsibility is to solicit high quality papers for the session oversee the review and present a 1 hour introductory tutorial in your session domain you are to solicit manuscripts have them refereed collaborate with the conference chairs in determining which manuscripts are to be accepted and structure presentation time in your session please contact us at the address below if you have any questions about the obligations entailed in becoming a session organizer procedure for submitting proposals session proposals can be as short as a single page and should in no case be more than 6 pages the proposal should define a specific technical area to be covered justify why the proposed area is appropriate for psb discuss why the topic is timely and important and how the topic has been addressed in other conferences or recent publications argue that there is likely to be sufficient high quality unpublished material to fill the session eg a list of researchers you intend to solicit for papers provide a short autobiographical sketch and an explicit statement that your organization endorses your involvement proposals and all conference related communications must be by e mail february 15 2012 proposals due march 15 2012 notification regarding the proposals each proposal will be evaluated by the organizing committee we look forward to your submissions send proposals via email to lawrence hunter ph d e mail larry hunter at ucdenver edu phone 1 303 724 3574 back to the main psb page updated january 31 2012
