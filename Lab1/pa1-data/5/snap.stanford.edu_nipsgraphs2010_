workshop on networks across disciplines in theory and applications will take place on december 10 or 11th in whistler bc workshop on networks across disciplines theory and applications december 11th in westin nordic room whistler bc overview networks are used across a wide variety of disciplines to describe interactions between entities in sociology these are relations between people such as friendships facebook in biology physical interactions between genes the internet sensor networks transport networks ecological networks just to name a few the applications of networks provide a wide variety of questions while researchers in machine learning statistical and physics communities search for ways to explain and model the observed phenomena the theoretical findings stemming from different areas are heterogeneous and often complimentary yet there are but a few means for intellectual exchange and collaboration the goal of our workshop is to actively promote a collaborative effort in addressing statistical and computational issues arising when modeling collections of data represented by networks static or dynamic to cross pollinate fields with ideas from different areas to introduce new questions to the theoretical modeling audience and to broaden the focus by considering new areas invited speakers with abstracts carter butts sociology uc irvine jonathan chang facebook aaron clauset computer science university of colorado boulder lise getoor computer science university of maryland sayan mukherjee statistics duke university schedule westin nordic 7 30 7 35 introduction by the organizers 7 35 8 20 lise getoor collective graph identification 8 20 9 05 aaron clauset the trouble with community detection 9 05 9 30 break and poster set up 9 30 10 00 poster spotlights 10 00 12 00 posters 12 00 15 30 break and ski 15 30 16 15 carter butts bounding complex network models with bernoulli graphs 16 15 17 00 sayan mukherjee geometry based graph and network models 17 00 17 15 coffee break 17 15 18 00 jonathan chang facebook challenges for 2011 18 00 18 30 panel discussion and closing remarks accepted posters 1 active surveying h sharara l getoor m norton pdf 2 active learning on graphs via spanning trees n cesa bianchi c gentile f vitale g zappella pdf 3 unsupervised discriminative approach to find biomarkers in lung cancer a goldenberg s mostafavi g quon pc boutros q morris 4 predicting node labels in large networks s mostafavi a goldenberg q morris 5 beyond keyword search discovering relevant scientific literature k el arini c guestrin 6 statistical mechanics of semi supervised clustering in sparse graphs a galstyan g ver steeg a allahverdyan 7 co evolving mixed membership blockmodels y cho a galstyan g ver steeg pdf 8 infinite multiple membership relational modeling for complex networks m mrup mn schmidt lk hansen pdf 9 soft partitioning in networks via bayesian non negative matrix factorization i psorakis s roberts b sheldon pdf 10 estimating networks with jumps m kolar ep xing pdf 11 community detection in networks the leader follower algorithm d shah tr zaman pdf 12 node clustering in graphs an empirical study r balasubramanyan f lin ww cohen pdf 13 community finding partitioning considered harmful f reid a mcdaid n hurley pdf 14 a latent space mapping for link prediction a brew m salter townshend pdf 15 regularized output kernel regression applied to protein protein interaction network inference celine brouard m szafranski f d alche buc pdf 16 regnann network inference using artificial neural networks m grimaldi g jurman r visintainer pdf 17 introduction to spectral metrics in biological network theory r visintainer g jurman m grimaldi c furlanello pdf 18 a triangle inequality for p resistance m herbster pdf 19 sampling graphs with a prescribed joint degree distribution using markov chains i stanton a pinar 20 population size estimation and internet link structure se fienberg a flaxman pdf 21 modeling the variance of network populations with mixed kronecker product graph models s moreno j neville s kirshner svn vishwanathan pdf 22 exact learning curves for gaussian process regression on community random graphs mj urry p sollich pdf 23 higher order graphical models for classification in social and affiliation networks e zheleva l getoor s sarawagi pdf 24 four factors influencing effectiveness in email communication networks o engel pdf workshop organizers edo airoldi harvard university anna goldenberg university of toronto jure leskovec stanford university
