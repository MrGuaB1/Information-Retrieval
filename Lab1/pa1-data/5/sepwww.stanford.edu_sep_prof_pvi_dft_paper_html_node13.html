convolution in the frequency domain next up previous print clean next setting up the fast up symmetries previous plot interpretation convolution in the frequency domain let the coefficients y t can be found from the coefficients x t and b t by convolution in the time domain or by multiplication in the frequency domain for the latter we would evaluate both x z and b z at uniform locations around the unit circle ie compute fourier sums x k and b k from x t and b t then we would form c k x k b k for all k and inverse fourier transform to y t the values y t come out the same as by the time domain convolution method roughly that of our calculation precision typically four byte arithmetic or about one part in 10 6 the only way in which you need to be cautious is to use zero padding greater than the combined lengths of x t and b t an example is shown in figure 8 it is the result of a fourier domain computation which shows that the convolution of a rectangle function with itself gives a triangle notice that the triangle is clean there are no unexpected end effects box2triangle figure 7 top shows a rectangle transformed to a sinc bottom shows the sinc squared back transformed to a triangle view because of the fast method of fourier transform described next the frequency domain calculation is quicker when both x z and b z have more than roughly 20 coefficients if either x z or b z has less than roughly 20 coefficients then the time domain calculation is quicker next up previous print clean next setting up the fast up symmetries previous plot interpretation stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
