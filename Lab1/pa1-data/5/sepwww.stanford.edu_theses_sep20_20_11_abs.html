gaussian elimination on a banded matrix by jeff thorson gaussian elimination on a banded matrix by jeff thorson two fortran routines included in this paper can be used to solve banded linear systems the routines use a gaussian elimination algorithm tailored to the specific banded matrix instead of the n 3 s multiples required to reduce a full matrix a banded matrix can be reduced in about nm 2 4 multiples where n is the dimension of the matrix and m is its bandwidth only the nonzero diagonals of the matrix need to be stored algorithm 2 does no pivoting algorithm 3 performs partial pivoting partial pivoting is inherently stabler than no pivoting at all though the difference in output between the two algorithms is probably negligible for regular wave equation operators the algorithm listings contain all relevant documentation for their use back to sep 20 index page download pdf 458 kb ps gz 707 kb stanford exploration project
