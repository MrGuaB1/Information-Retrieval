stanford university cs 223 b introduction to computer vision stanford university cs 223 b introduction to computer vision project p15 shadow detection and removal for the darpa grand challenge project goal stanford is participating in the darpa grand challenge an autonomous robot desert race among others our robot relies on camera video to detect road patches that are safe for our vehicle to traverse a major problem so far have been shadows cast by mountains plants and the vehicle itself these shadow create strong edges which can make even relatively smooth road look undrivable the goal of this project therefore is to identify such shadowed image parts and to compensate the shadow effect project scope your algorithm will accept as an input a video stream and if necessary other informations provided by the race vehicle software such as time of day or vehicle position and orientation your task will be to create an output video where the effect of shadow is compensated in a way that road parts in shadow will resemble parts not in shadow as closely as possible furthermore the algorithm should run in real time tasks detect shadow we already have a histogram based implementation for this which you can use extend or replace remove shadow areas with too small image extend easy compensate for image brightness easy correct color hue and saturation harder you might need to estimate illumination conditions such as weather overcast sunny raining and environmental reflections project status chien yu chen chienyu at stanford yu shan chang yschang at cs ping hsien chin pjchin at cs wei wei wei wei at cs point of contact hendrik dahlkamp midterm report not yet submited final report not yet submitted cs 223b introduction to computer vision stanford university course overview announcements time and location course materials schedule instructors assignments projects policies links
