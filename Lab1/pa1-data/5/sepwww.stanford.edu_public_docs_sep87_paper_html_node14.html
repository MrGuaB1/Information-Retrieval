synthetic examples next up previous print clean next upward continuation up wave equation datuming operators previous generalized formulation of wave equation synthetic examples in this section i apply the kirchhoff phase shift and finite difference wave equation datuming operators to synthetic data in order to compare them and to demonstrate some basic characteristics of the datuming process to gain the full benefit of wave equation datuming data should generally be datumed prestack however i examine the zero offset case here because it is a first step in gaining intuition into how wave equation datuming transforms the data and also because it is easy to visualize what the zero offset synthetics should look like the subsurface model for the synthetic data consists of an anticline a syncline and two point diffractors in a constant velocity media the medium velocity is 2 km s topography is modeled as a 200 m high cosine shaped mountain figure the result of zero offset kirchhoff modeling is shown in figure a the effect of the topography is the creation of a low frequency undulation which completely distorts the synthetic data submodel figure 6 synthetic subsurface model and topography topography and subsurface structure used to generate the zero offset synthetic data the two point diffractors are depicted by astrecies above and below the anticline syncline structure view burn build edit restore upward continuation downward continuation near field vs far field kirchhoff datuming recursive kirchhoff continuation next up previous print clean next upward continuation up wave equation datuming operators previous generalized formulation of wave equation stanford exploration project 2 12 2001
