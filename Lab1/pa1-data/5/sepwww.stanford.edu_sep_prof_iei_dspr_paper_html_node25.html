derivation of group velocity equation previous up next print clean next derivation of energy migration up anisotropy dispersion in migration previous analyzing errors of migration derivation of group velocity equation an impulse function at the origin in x z space is a superposition of fourier components 22 physics and perhaps numerical analysis leads to a dispersion relation that is a functional relation between k x and k z say the most common example of such a dispersion relation is the scalar wave equation the solution to the equation is 23 integrating 23 over k x k z produces a monochromatic time function that at t 0 is an impulse at x z 0 0 this expression at some very large time t is 24 at t very large the integrand is a very rapidly oscillating function of unit magnitude thus the integral will be nearly zero unless the quantity in square brackets is found to be nearly independent of k x and k z for some sizable area in k x k z space such a flat spot can be found in the same way that the maximum or minimum of any two dimensional function is found by setting derivatives equal to zero this analytical approach is known as the stationary phase method it gives 25 26 so in conclusion at time t the disturbances will be located at 27 which justifies the definition of group velocity now let us see how the left side of figure 8 was calculated the 15 dispersion relation was solved for and inserted into 27 the resulting x z turned out to be a function of trying all possible values of gave the curve previous up next print clean next derivation of energy migration up anisotropy dispersion in migration previous analyzing errors of migration stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
