correlation next up previous print clean next coherency up crosscorrelation and coherency previous crosscorrelation and coherency correlation correlation is a concept similar to cosine a cosine measures the angle between two vectors it is given by the dot product of the two vectors divided by their magnitudes 31 this is the sample normalized correlation formally the normalized correlation is defined using x and y as zero mean scalar random variables instead of sample vectors the summation is thus an expectation instead of a dot product 32 a practical difficulty arises when the ensemble averaging is simulated over a sample the problem occurs with small samples and is most dramatically illustrated when we deal with a sample of only one element then the sample correlation is 33 regardless of what value the random number x or the random number y should take for any n the sample correlation scatters away from zero such scatter is called bias the topic of bias and variance of coherency estimates is a complicated one but a rule of thumb seems to be to expect bias and variance of of about for samples of size n bias no doubt accounts for many false discoveries since cause and effect is often inferred from correlation next up previous print clean next coherency up crosscorrelation and coherency previous crosscorrelation and coherency stanford exploration project 3 1 2001
