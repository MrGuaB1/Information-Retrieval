stanford solar center about the sun for students for educators space weather monitors ancient observatories solar folklore solar art & literature calculating the sun's angular velocity calculating the sun's angular velocity what is angular velocity angular velocity is how fast something travels in a circle or on a sphere it is the angle by which an object spins in a certain time its rotation rate imagine a clock the old fashioned kind with hands the minute hand goes around the clock a circle 360 degrees in 60 minutes to find its angular velocity or rotation rate you need to divide the number of degrees by the number of minutes 360 degrees 60 minutes 6 degrees per minute so the minute hand's angular velocity or rate of rotation is 6 degrees per minute how can i determine the sun's angular velocity we can use the movement of a sunspot to determine the sun's rate of rotation just like we used the minute hand of a clock to do this accurately you will have to use a transparent template for your sketches of the sun's disk the template has marked on it the degrees of longitude on a sphere from your sketches pick the sunspot group which is the most long lived that is which appears in most of your sketches using your template figure out how many degrees of sun the spot group traveled across and how long it took to move that far sun's angular velocity degrees the spot has covered time it took for the spot to travel sun's rotation rate 360 degrees angular velocity going further if the sun has been particularly active and you have sunspots sketched at different latitutes on the sun's surface compute the angular velocity for different sunspot groups which appear at varying latitudes do you get the same solar rotation rate for each set if not why not want more information on the sun's rotation return to sunspot rotation activity home request solar posters site map glossary about us contact us 2008 by stanford solar center permitted uses credits
