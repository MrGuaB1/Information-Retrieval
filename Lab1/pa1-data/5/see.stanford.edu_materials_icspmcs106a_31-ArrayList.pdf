h13 section 2 page 1 mehran sahami handout 31 cs 106a october 31 2007 arraylists reference for hangman based on a handout by patrick young this handout gives you a quick reference for some of the concepts related to arraylists that may be useful to you for implementing part iii of the hangman assignment arraylists you can think of an arraylist as being a special object which is used to store a list of other objects in your case you ll be using an arraylist to store the list of strings which can be chosen as words for hangman using arraylists arraylists are defined in the java util package to use arraylists you ll need to import the package import java util declaring an arraylist variable arraylists can store a variety of different types of information for example you can create an arraylist of govals an arraylist of grects or in the case of hangman an arraylist of strings when declaring a variable of type arraylist you ll need to specify what type of data is stored in the arraylist using a special angular bracket notation your declaration will look something like this private arraylist string wordlist the information in the angular brackets tells java that this is an arraylist of strings arraylists themselves are objects and are created using constructors just as govals and grects are created using constructors here is how we would create a new arraylist and assign it to our variable wordlist wordlist new arraylist string adding elements to your arraylist call the add method to add elements to your arraylist because your arraylist has been declared to contain strings you can call the add method with a string as an argument string word readline reading a string from the user wordlist add word page 2 accessing elements of your arraylist to access an element of your arraylist you can call the get method passing in the index of the element you want to access remember arraylists as with regular arrays in java are zero indexed in other words the first element in the list is actually at index 0 the second element is at index 1 and so forth because your list is declared to contain strings java assumes that the element returned by get is a string int index 0 index of first element in arraylist string word wordlist get index determine the size of your arraylist your arraylist will keep track of the number of element which you have added to determine the number of elements in the arraylist call the size method int totalcount wordlist size chapter 11.8 is your friend for more information about arraylists there's a lot more to learn about arraylists this handout is just providing a quick references for the hangman assignment we will cover arraylists more extensively in class and you can read more about arraylists in chapter 11.8 of the class textbook
