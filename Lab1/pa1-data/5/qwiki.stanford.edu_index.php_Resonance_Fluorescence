resonance fluorescence qwiki resonance fluorescence from qwiki jump to navigation search definition effect that occurs when an atom is subject to an electromagnetic field whose frequency is near the atom's resonant frequency due to the nonlinear nature of the atom the behavior of the system can be non trivial for example the incoherent fluorescence spectrum at sufficiently high intensity is not a single lorentzian peak as one might expect but rather a three peak structure often referred to as the mollow triplet equations the master equation for resonance fluorescence can be written as see carmichael reference below where is the atomic hamiltonian and the  operators are the 2x2 paul spin matrices this master equation is derived assuming the standard born approximation and markoff approximation and assumes a classical driving field that is left undepleted by the interaction references howard carmichael statistical methods in quantum optics i master equations and fokker planck equations 1999 in particular chapter 2 pp 41 72 retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php resonance_fluorescence categories concept optics quantum optics views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 10 september 2005 at 00 13 this page has been accessed 7522 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
