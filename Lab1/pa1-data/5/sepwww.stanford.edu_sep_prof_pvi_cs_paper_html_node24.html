spectral transfer function next up previous print clean next crosscorrelation up correlation and spectra previous time domain conjugate spectral transfer function filters are often used to change the spectra of given data with input x z filters b z and output y z we have y z b z x z and the fourier conjugate multiplying these two relations together we get which says that the spectrum of the input times the spectrum of the filter equals the spectrum of the output filters are often characterized by the shape of their spectra this shape is the same as the spectral ratio of the output over the input 47 next up previous print clean next crosscorrelation up correlation and spectra previous time domain conjugate stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
