grasping using optical proximity sensors reactive grasping using optical proximity sensors we propose novel optical proximity sensors for improving grasping these sensors mounted on fingertips allow pre touch pose estimation and therefore allow for online grasp adjustments to an initial grasp point without the need for premature object contact or regrasping strategies abstract we propose a system for improving grasping using optical proximity sensors mounted on fingertips that allows for online grasp adjustments to an initial grasp point without the need for premature object contact or regrasping strategies our system is composed of a novel optical proximity sensor for pre touch pose estimation a probabilistic model for robustly combining sensor readings and a hierarchical reactive controller this system can be used to complement existing grasp planning algorithms or be used in more interactive settings where a human indicates the location of objects we perform a series of experiments using a three fingered hand equipped with our custom designed sensors to grasp a variety of common objects with mixed geometries and surface textures the results validate the system as a means for improving the stability and quality of existing grasp strategies videos 640x480 good quality mpeg4 86 mb 360x270 good quality mpeg4 35 mb 360x270 mpeg4 4.9 mb reactive grasping using optical proximity sensors kaijen hsiao paul nangeroni manfred huber ashutosh saxena andrew y ng to appear in icra 2009 pdf home publications resume projects stair homepage
