prestack migration ellipse next up previous print clean next constant offset migration up prestack migration previous cheops pyramid prestack migration ellipse equation 1 in y h space is 5 a basic insight into equation 1 is to notice that at constant offset h and constant travel time t the locus of possible reflectors is an ellipse in the y z plane centered at y 0 the reason it is an ellipse follows from the geometric definition of an ellipse to draw an ellipse place a nail or tack into s on figure 1 and another into g connect the tacks by a string that is exactly long enough to go through y 0 z an ellipse going through y 0 z may be constructed by sliding a pencil along the string keeping the string tight the string keeps the total distance tv constant as is shown in figure 3 ellipse1 figure 3 prestack migration ellipse the locus of all scatterers with constant traveltime for source s and receiver g view burn build edit restore replacing depth z in equation 5 by the vertical traveltime depth we get 6 next up previous print clean next constant offset migration up prestack migration previous cheops pyramid stanford exploration project 12 26 2000
