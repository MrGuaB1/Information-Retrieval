mdi daily synoptic magnetic field data mdi daily magnetic field synoptic data new hmi images now available every 15 minutes latest and archives mdi ceased regular science operations in early 2011 mdi magnetogram availabiliy is presented in coverage maps enter a date in the field below to retrieve a table linking to that day's magnetograms and the daily update of the synoptic charts data and plots can be downloaded examples and descriptions of products are available at the bottom of this page recalibrated december 2008 daily magnetograms and daily synoptic charts specify a date or mdi day number mdi magnetic data are once again available from this site latest preliminary synoptic chart note preliminary magnetograms and daily synoptic maps are now calibrated to lev 1.8 2 note mdi lev1 8 full disk magnetograms in the synoptic 96 minute series were recalibrated on december 24 2008 note mdi lev1 8 full disk magnetograms in the one minute _01h series have all been recalibrated note final synoptic charts have been computed using the december 2008 recalibration completed january 28 2009 export requests for lev1 8 magnetograms are being filled with data calibrated with the process as announced in solarnews december 2008 see lev 1.8 for a summary of the magnetogram calibration history examples and descriptions of available synoptic charts images and magnetograms the daily datasets consist of one or more of the following four types of data 96m data plot a gif of postage stamp images of the nominally 15 mdi magnetograms taken each day with a 96 minute cadence these plots are made from definitive data as opposed to preliminary data and will generally not be available until a few weeks after data collection preliminary data downloadable quick look magnetic data files there are typically only a few images per day they are usually available one or two days after data collection and are only available through these pages until the definitive magnetograms are generated warning these data are not properly calibrated and should be used with care fd_96m definitive data a directory listing of the magnetogram data sets for the corresponding day shift click the fits files to retrieve the fits file containing the magnetic data the file sequence number indicates the 96 minute slot and corresponds to the above postage stamps numbers these plots may not be available until a few weeks after data collection preliminary synoptic charts synoptic charts generated each day from the eof preliminary magnetograms the preliminary charts are averaged from the full resolutuion to a more managable 720 360 they extend 60 degrees east of the central meridian gif color compressed postscript b w or fits versions are available for downloading these are typically available one or two days after data collection daily preliminary synoptic charts are replaced with daily definitive synoptic charts as the definitive data are processed general info science objectives & proposals results images & documentation data services & info operations other links solar center page last revised tuesday 31 jan 2012 17 44 09 pst
