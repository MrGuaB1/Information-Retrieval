dimitri bevc's home page welcome to dimitri bevc's home page i completed my ph d in the summer of 1995 my thesis is sep report number 87 i am now at 3dgeo development inc in mountain view you can send me e mail at dimitri 3dgeo com imaging in areas of rugged topography and complex velocity structure presents many challenges i have developed an efficient layer stripping kirchhoff migration algorithm that produces excellent imaging results using first arrival traveltimes applying wave equation datuming early in the processing flow for land data with rugged topography results in improved imaging other interesting imaging issues i ve worked on at sep include anti aliased migration operators and work towards designing a remedial depth migration operator which properly maps time migrated data to depth find out more about my work at sep by checking out my publications and research movies brief biography resume 35k postscript ph d thesis imaging under rugged topography and complex velocity structure list of publications preprint of imaging complex structures with semi recursive kirchhoff migration 1.7 meg compressed postscript preprint of flooding the topography wave equation redatuming of land data with rugged acquisition topography 7.5 meg compressed postscript reprint of plumes response of time migration to lateral velocity variation 0.5 meg compressed postscript menu of research movies stanford exploration project home page tel 415 723 1250 email dimitri sep stanford edu last updated
