expectation and variance next up previous print clean next probability and independence up time statistical resolution previous ensemble expectation and variance a conceptual average over the ensemble or expectation is denoted by the symbol the index for summation over the ensemble is never shown explicitly every random variable is presumed to have one thus the true mean at time t is defined as the mean can vary with time 12 the variance is defined to be the power after the mean is removed ie 13 conventionally is referred to as the variance and is called the standard deviation for notational convenience it is customary to write m t and x t simply as m and x t using the verbal context to specify whether m and are time variable or constant for example the standard deviation of the seismic amplitudes on a seismic trace before correction of spherical divergence decreases with time since these amplitudes are expected to be globally smaller as time goes on when manipulating algebraic expressions remember that the symbol behaves like a summation sign namely 14 note that the summation index is not given since the sum is over the ensemble not time to get some practice with the expectation symbol we can reduce equation 13 15 equation 15 says that the energy is the variance plus the squared mean next up previous print clean next probability and independence up time statistical resolution previous ensemble stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
