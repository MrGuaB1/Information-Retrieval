fourier sum next up previous print clean next fourier and z transform up fourier sums previous sampled time and nyquist fourier sum in the previous section we superposed uniformly spaced frequencies now we will superpose delayed impulses the frequency function of a delayed impulse at time delay t 0 is adding some pulses yields the fourier sum 19 the fourier sum transforms the signal b t to the frequency function time will often be denoted by t even though its units are sample units instead of physical units thus we often see b t in equations like 19 instead of b n resulting in an implied next up previous print clean next fourier and z transform up fourier sums previous sampled time and nyquist stanford exploration project 3 1 2001
