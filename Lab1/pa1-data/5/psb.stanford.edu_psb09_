pacific symposium on biocomputing 2009 this is the post event web site for psb 2009 information on the upcoming psb is now available the psb 2009 attendance list electronic proceedings and schedule are available please see below for more information pacific symposium on biocomputing 2009 the pacific symposium on biocomputing psb 2009 was an international multidisciplinary conference for the presentation and discussion of current research in the theory and application of computational methods in problems of biological significance papers and presentations were rigorously peer reviewed and were published in an archival proceedings volume psb 2009 was held january 5 9 2009 at the fairmont orchid big island of hawaii psb 2009 brought together top researchers from the us the asian pacific nations and around the world to exchange research results and address open issues in all aspects of computational biology psb is a forum for the presentation of work in databases algorithms interfaces visualization modeling and other computational methods as applied to biological problems with emphasis on applications in data rich areas of molecular biology the psb has been designed to be responsive to the need for critical mass in sub disciplines within biocomputing for that reason it is the only meeting whose sessions are defined dynamically each year in response to specific proposals psb sessions are organized by leaders in the emerging areas and targeted to provide a forum for publication and discussion of research in biocomputing's hot topics in this way psb provides an early forum for serious examination of emerging methods and approaches in this rapidly changing field psb 2009 sessions biomolecular networks from analysis to synthesis computational challenges in comparative genomics gene family evolution ancestral genome reconstruction and applications to human genetics dynamics of biological networks emerging challenges in multi scale modeling in biology knowledge driven analysis and data integration for high throughput biological data molecular bioinformatics for diseases session survey tutorials were offered on january 5 2009 psb 2009 workshops new this year psb offered two three hour workshops on january 5 2009 the workshops were created to provide an opportunity for a gathering that will not be based on peer reviewed papers included in the proceedings book the workshops consisted of presentations by invited speakers abstract submissions for the workshops were evaluated by the workshop co chairs peer reviewed papers the core of the conference consists of rigorously peer reviewed full length papers reporting on original work the online proceedings contain 100 of the papers the 2009 bound proceedings volume is available for $75.00 plus shipping if you are interested in purchasing it please send an email to the psb coordinator at psb hawaii gmail com the complete set of peer reviewed papers is available as a bound proceedings volume and can be ordered from world scientific press see the original call for papers for more information keynote speakers greg hampikian professor of biology and criminal and justice director of the idaho innocence project boise state university gave a keynote lecture entitled dna don t lie how bioinformatics freed some of my best friends and sent the guilty to prison drew endy assistant professor department of bioengineering stanford university gave a keynote lecture entitled post synthesis genetics & engineering biological simplicity sponsors psb gratefully acknowledges the support of its sponsors we would like to offer a special thanks to the national library of medicine national institutes of health for their participation since the founding of the conference and for their commitment to travel support for psb 1999 psb 2000 psb 2001 psb 2002 psb 2003 psb 2004 psb 2005 psb 2006 psb 2007 psb 2008 and psb 2009 psb is affiliated with the international society for computational biology please visit our sponsors websites and let them know you appreciate their support of psb national library of medicine national science foundation international society for computational biology if you or your organization would like to be a sponsor of psb please email the psb coordinator at psb hawaii gmail com previous psb meetings information about previous psb meetings including the full electronic proceedings is available the 2008 psb meeting the 2007 psb meeting the 2006 psb meeting the 2005 psb meeting the 2004 psb meeting the 2003 psb meeting the 2002 psb meeting the 2001 psb meeting the 2000 psb meeting the 1999 psb meeting the 1998 psb meeting the 1997 psb meeting the 1996 psb meeting for more information tiffany murray psb coordinator department of bioengineering 318 campust drive s170 stanford ca usa 94305 5444 telephone 650 725 0659 fax 650 723 8544 email psb hawaii gmail com this page is no longer being updated last update february 9 2009
