why the causal wavelet is minimum phase next up previous print clean next pathological examples up spectral factorization previous finding a causal wavelet why the causal wavelet is minimum phase next we see why the causal wavelet b z which we have made from the prescribed spectrum turns out to be minimum phase first return to the original definition of minimum phase a causal wavelet is minimum phase if and only if its inverse is causal we have our wavelet in the form b z e c z consider another wavelet a z e c z constructed analogously by the same reasoning a t is also causal since a z b z 1 we have found a causal inverse wavelet thus the b t wavelet is minimum phase since the phase is a fourier series it must be periodic that is it cannot increase indefinitely with as it does for the nonminimum phase wavelet see figure 19 next up previous print clean next pathological examples up spectral factorization previous finding a causal wavelet stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
