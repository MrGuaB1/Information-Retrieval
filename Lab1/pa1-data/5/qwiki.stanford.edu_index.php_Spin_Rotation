spin rotation qwiki spin rotation from qwiki jump to navigation search consider the rotation of the vector spin operator about an arbitrary direction by the angle where the spin components obey the usual commutation relations this rotation can be represented in the heisenberg picture as where the s i can then be derived using campbell baker hausdorff methods expand explicit rotation formula alternatively we can use a relation from eq 3.16 of 1 to find these operators from this we can easily expand and rearrange terms to show retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php spin_rotation category concept views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 14 september 2005 at 21 50 this page has been accessed 4803 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
