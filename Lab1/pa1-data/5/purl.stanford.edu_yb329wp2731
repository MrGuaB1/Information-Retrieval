stanford digital repository stanford digital repository time parallel methods for accelerating the solution of structural dynamics problems creator cortial julien remi contributor s farhat charbel primary advisor alonso juan jose 1968 advisor lew adrian advisor stanford university institute for computational and mathematical engineering description the classical approach for solving evolution partial differential equations pdes using a parallel computer consists in first partitioning the spatial domain and assigning each subdomain to a processor to achieve space parallelism then advancing the solution sequentially however enabling parallelism along the time dimension despite its intrinsic difficulty can be of paramount importance to fast computations when space parallelism is unfeasible cannot fully exploit a massively parallel machine or when near real time prediction is desired the aforementioned objective can be achieved by applying classical domain decomposition principles to the time axis the latter is first partitioned into time slices to be processed independently starting with approximate seed information that provides a set of initial conditions the response is then advanced in parallel in each time slice using a standard time stepping integrator this decomposed solution exhibits discontinuities or jumps at the time slice boundaries if the initial guess is not accurate applying a newton like approach to the time dependent system a correction function is then computed to improve the accuracy of the seed values and the process is repeated until convergence is reached methods based on the above concept have been successfully applied to various problems but none was found to be competitive for even for the simplest of second order hyperbolic pdes a class of equations that covers the field of structural dynamics among others to overcome this difficulty a key idea is to improve the sequential propagator used for correcting the seed values observing that the original evolution problem and the derived corrective one are closely related the present work first demonstrates how this insight can be brought to fruition in the context of linear oscillators with numerical examples featuring structural models ranging from academic to more challenging large scale ones an extension of this method to nonlinear equations is then developed and its concrete application to geometrically nonlinear transient dynamics is presented finally it is shown how the time reversibility property that characterizes some of the above problems can be exploited to develop a new framework that provides an increased speed up factor julien cortial submitted to the institute for computational and mathematical engineering thesis ph d stanford university 2011 view in searchworks 2011 by julien remi cortial this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution noncommercial 3.0 unported license file download description julien_cortial_thesis augmented pdf body of dissertation stanford university stanford california 94305 650 725 1064 terms of use copyright complaints
