hand migration previous up next print clean next reflector steepening up exploding reflectors previous an impulse in the hand migration given a seismic event at x 0 t 0 with a slope let us determine its position x m t m after migration consider a planar wavefront at angle to the earth's surface traveling a distance dx in a time dt assuming a velocity v we have the wave angle in terms of measurable quantities 3 the vertical travel path is less than the angled path by 4 a travel time t 0 and a horizontal component of velocity gives the lateral location after migration 5 consideration of a hyperbola migrating towards its apex shows why 5 contains a minus sign equations 4 and 5 are the basic equations for manual migration of reflection seismic data they tell you where the point migrates but they do not tell you how the slope p will change previous up next print clean next reflector steepening up exploding reflectors previous an impulse in the stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
