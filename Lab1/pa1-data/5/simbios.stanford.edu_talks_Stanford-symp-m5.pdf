france stanford symposium on selected topics in biophysics page 1 france stanford symposium on selected topics in biophysics tuesday feb 9 2010 4.15 pm topological classification of rna structures henri orland cea saclay we present a novel topological classification of rna secondary structures with pseudoknots it is based on the topological genus of the circular diagram associated to the rna base pair structure the genus is a positive integer number whose value quantifies the topological complexity of the folded rna structure the lecture will be given in alway m106 wednesday feb 10 2010 2.15 pm beyond the poisson boltzmann model modeling biomolecule water and water water interactions patrice koehl uc davis we present an extension to the poisson boltzmann model in which the solvent is modeled as an assembly of self orienting dipoles of variable densities van der waals attractions between these dipoles are included implicitly using a yukawa potential field the computed water density profiles resemble those derived from molecular dynamics simulations wednesday feb 10 2010 3.30 pm x ray structure of a pentameric ligand gated ion channel marc delarue inst pasteur pentameric ligand gated ion channels from the cys loop family mediate fast chemo electrical transduction but the mechanisms of ion permeation and gating of these membrane proteins remain elusive here we present the x ray structure at 2.9 a resolution of the bacterial gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand gated ion channel homologue glic structural comparison with elic a bacterial homologue are consistent with a model of pore opening based on both quaternary twist and tertiary deformation frederic poitevin inst pasteur modeling the dynamics of pore opening of the receptor wednesday lectures will be given in alway m112 for further information contact sybille katz 723 1925
