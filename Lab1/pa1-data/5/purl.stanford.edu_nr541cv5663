stanford digital repository stanford digital repository multiple rank updates to matrix factorizations for nonlinear analysis and circuit design creator deng linzhong contributor s saunders michael a primary advisor liu zhihong advisor murray walter advisor stanford university institute for computational and mathematical engineering description for the numerical solution of ode pdes that describe the basic laws of science such as kirchhoff's laws in circuit analysis or nonlinear deformation equations in structural analysis a series of linear equations ax b are generated to represent the basic laws the size of a could reach 10 billion in full chip verification or 1 billion in structure foundation seismic simulation the traditional method is to solve these linear equations independently which leads to a computational bottleneck when we simulate large and complicated objects because more than 95 percent of the simulation time lies in solving the equations this thesis addresses the computational bottleneck by modifying the matrix a's factorization at each simulation step based on the similarities between two consecutive linear systems to achieve this aim we define the similarities as an initial matrix a with multiple rank corrections then we design algorithms to solve the linear systems based on updating concepts the basic algorithm is a rank 1 update of the factors of an unsymmetric matrix to maintain stability new algorithms are designed to implement partial or full pivoting strategies for the update procedure to improve performance and overcome parallelization difficulties during traditional factorization a pipeline is designed to do multiple rank updates of the matrix factors we prove two theorems for this parallel computing one states that the multiple rank update sequences are independent the other called the base camp theorem describes a multiple rank merge rule to reduce the computing effort a divide and conquer algorithm for sparse matrix factorization is also described finally we apply the multiple rank modification of matrix factors to nonlinear analysis in structural engineering and functionality verification in circuit design the same process can be applied in other time domain problems and nonlinear systems including fluid dynamics aerospace chemical processing structure analysis graphics rendering mems seismic biotech and electromagnetic field analyses linzhong deng submitted to the institute for computational and mathematical engineering thesis ph d stanford university 2010 view in searchworks 2010 by linzhong deng this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution noncommercial 3.0 unported license file download description linzhong deng thesis augmented pdf body of dissertation stanford university stanford california 94305 650 725 1064 terms of use copyright complaints
