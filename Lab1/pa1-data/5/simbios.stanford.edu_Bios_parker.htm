parker simbios back to people david parker i am a ph d student working in scott delp's group the goal of my research is to create a computational model integrating biophysical structural and experimental data that will simulate the movement of myosin v due to its large size 40000 atoms and the long time scales involved ms to second a computational model will require the development of spatial and temporal coarse graining strategies what i particularly like about my research is thinking about how the mechano chemistry of various molecular motors can be modeled and simulated using computational mechanics i also enjoy developing software to model simulate and visualize molecular motor systems my work is directly related to the myosin dbp e mail davep stanford ed feedback collaborations career resources administration contact
