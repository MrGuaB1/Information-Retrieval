speed of 2 d gaussian smoothing next up previous print clean next probability and convolution up smoothing in two dimensions previous gaussian mounds speed of 2 d gaussian smoothing this approximate gaussian smoothing in two dimensions is very fast only eight add subtract pairs are required per output point and no multiplies at all are required except for final scaling the compute time is independent of the widths of the gaussian you should understand this if you understood that one dimensional convolution with a rectangle requires just one add subtract pair per output point thus this technique should be useful in two dimensional slant stack exercises deduce that a 2 d filter based on the subroutine triangle which produces the 2 d quasi gaussian mound in figure 12 has a gain of unity at zero two dimensional frequency also known as k x k y 0 let the 2 d quasi gaussian filter be known as f sketch the spectral response of f sketch the spectral response of 1 f and suggest a use for it the tent filter can be implemented by smoothing first on the 1 axis and then on the 2 axis the conjugate operator smooths first on the 2 axis and then on the 1 axis the tent filter operator should be self adjoint equal to its conjugate unless some complication arises at the sides or corners how can a dot product test be used to see if a tent filter program is self adjoint next up previous print clean next probability and convolution up smoothing in two dimensions previous gaussian mounds stanford exploration project 10 21 1998
