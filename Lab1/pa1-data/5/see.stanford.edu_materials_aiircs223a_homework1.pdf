introduction to robotics cs223a homework 1 winter 2007 2008 page 1 introduction to robotics cs223a homework 1 winter 2007 2008 due wednesday january 23 some tips for doing cs223a problem sets use abbreviations for trigonometric functions eg c for cos  s1 or s1 for sin 1 in situations where it would be tedious to repeatedly write sin cos etc unless instructed otherwise leave square roots in symbolic form rather than writing out their decimal values if you give a vector as an answer make sure that you specify what frame it is given in if it is not clear from context the same rule applies to rotation and transformation matrices 1 a frame b and a frame a are initially coincident frame b is rotated about yb by an angle  and then rotated about the new zb by an angle  determine the 3 3 rotation matrix a b r which will transform the coordinates of a position vector from bp its value in frame b into ap its value in frame a 2 we are given a single frame a and a position vector ap described in this frame we then transform ap by first rotating it about za by an angle  then rotating about ya by an angle  determine the 3 3 rotation matrix operator r   which describes this transformation 3 a given a transformation matrix b a t 1 0 0 1 0 cos  sin  2 0 sin  cos  3 0 0 0 1 find a b t b given  45 and bp 4 5 6 t compute ap 4 given the following 3 3 matrix r 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 a show that it is a rotation matrix b determine a unit vector that defines the axis of rotation and the angle in degrees of rotation c what are the euler parameters 1 2 3 4 of r
