day and night in sid data sunlight is responsible for most the ionization of the earth's ionosphere a nighttime the only ionizing influences are cosmic rays so there is a distinct shape to a 24 hour sid data graph with unique signatures or shapes of the graph appearing at sunrise and sunset here is an example of a 24 hour period without any solar flares we added the colors and labels to the graph to help you understand it during the nighttime cosmic rays and thunderstorms and other natural phenomena affect the ionosphere hence the data is usuall very wiggly or noisy during the day the sun's influence overpowers the cosmic rays and other forces so the data is usually quiet although the sid monitors are designed to detect sudden ionospheric disturbances sids caused by solar flares they also detect the normal influence of solar x rays and uv light as well as cosmic rays at nighttime
