coherence index ci the eigenvector v corresponding to the largest eigenvalue may be interpreted as the primary fiber direction within that voxel coherence of axons between neighboring voxels can be estimated by comparing the direction of the primary eigenvectors let v ij be the primary eigenvector defining the main diffusion direction in voxel i j we then define the coherence index ci as the mean dot product of v ij and v in its eight neighboring voxels v rc when the eigenvectors are of unity length the dot product v ij v rc is the cosine of the angle between v ij and v rc the ci in a voxel will be the mean cosine for the angle between the directions of principal diffusion directions between each voxel and its eight neighbors and will have a value between 0 and 1 this coherence index was first described in klingberg t et al myelination and organization of the frontal white matter in children a diffusion tensor mri study neuroreport 1999 10 1 5 medline citation and it is similar to the organizational index proposed in basser pj and pierpaoli c microstructural and physiological features of tissues elucidated by quantitative diffusion tensor mri jmr b 111 209 219 1996 medline citation example ci map
