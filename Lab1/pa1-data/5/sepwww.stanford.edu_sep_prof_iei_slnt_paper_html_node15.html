inverse slant stack previous up next print clean next plane wave superposition up slant stack previous slant stack and fourier inverse slant stack tomography in medical imaging is based on the same mathematics as inverse slant stack simply stated two dimensional tomography or inverse slant stacking is the reconstruction of a function given line integrals through it the inverse slant stack formula will follow from the definition of two dimensional fourier integration 20 substitute and into 20 notice that when is negative the integration with dp runs from positive to negative instead of the reverse to keep the integration in the conventional sense of negative to positive introduce the absolute value more generally a change of variable of volume integrals introduces the jacobian of the transformation thus 21 22 observe that the in 22 contain an inverse fourier transform of a product of three functions of frequency the product of three functions in the domain is a convolution in the time domain the three functions are first which by 19 is the ft of the slant stack second is a delay operator ie an impulse function of time at time px third is an filter the filter is called a rho filter the rho filter does not depend on p so we may separate it from the integration over p let denote convolution introduce the delay px as an argument shift finally we have the inverse slant stack equation we have been seeking 23 it is curious that the inverse to the slant stack operation 14 is basically another slant stacking operation 23 with a sign change previous up next print clean next plane wave superposition up slant stack previous slant stack and fourier stanford exploration project 10 31 1997
