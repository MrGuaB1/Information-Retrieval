entropy of entanglement qwiki entropy of entanglement from qwiki jump to navigation search given a pure state and a partition for the system a b the entropy of entanglement is defined as where the von neumann entropy is s  tr log 2  and any entropy that results from performing a partial trace on the system must be a consequence of initial entanglement provided that the initial state is pure for product states the entropy is zero since the single eigenvalue for each of the pure states  a and  b is one the maximum entropy of entanglement given a partition with dimensions and with is log 2 d a a state that achieves this maximum is the entropy of entanglement has the attractive feature that it is straightforward to compute it requires only performing a partial trace then computing eigenvalues of the result the drawback of the entropy is that it only qualifies as an entanglement monotone for initially pure states retrieved from http qwiki stanford edu index php entropy_of_entanglement categories concept entanglement monotone quantum information views page discussion view source history personal tools log in create account navigation main page browse categories recent changes random page community portal help faq sign up search toolbox what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link powered by mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified on 7 september 2005 at 00 10 this page has been accessed 6209 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 privacy policy about qwiki disclaimers
