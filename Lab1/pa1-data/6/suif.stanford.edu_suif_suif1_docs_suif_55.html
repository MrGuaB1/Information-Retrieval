the suif library variable symbols go to the previous next section variable symbols in suif variable symbols represent data objects variable symbols are represented by objects of the var_sym class this class adds a field to specify the type of the variable as well as some additional flags unlike procedures and labels variables may be defined in any scope suif provides optional sub variables to make it easier to deal with pieces of aggregate objects that may or may not overlap in particular fortran equivalences and reshaped common blocks instead of referring to a piece of an aggregate by an offset combined with the aggregate symbol a sub variable can be created to represent the data at a particular offset within the aggregate so that it can be referenced in the same way as if it were not contained within an aggregate structure variable features basic features of variables sub variables variables contained within aggregates variable definitions definitions of global and static variables go to the previous next section
