david brown david brown lawrence berkeley national laboratory i am a relative latecomer to slac having worked here only during the babar years prior to that i was at cern and mpi munich working on aleph studying the z couplings to heavy flavor before that i was a graduate student on cdf exploring qcd having worked on different experiments has given me an appreciation for the importance of pursuing multiple avenues of research and how results from one experiment can have important consequences for others with babar i ve had the chance to participate in the development of a us hep project all the way from concept to a world class experiment and now finally to see it reach the end of it's active life i understand what kind of commitment it takes to put together a hep experiment and how much more difficult that has become in the current research and financial climate in spite of these difficulties i strongly believe that slac still has an important part to play in the world of hep and that it is up to us the users to make sure that slac management and doe hear that message as sluo executive i will push for continuing slac support of hep if the proposed superb factory in frascatti is approved slac will have an essential role to play in terms of providing materials and expertise and in terms of helping organize the us superb community this is a crucial time for the superb project with major european reviews concluding in the next 6 months the us community needs to be ready to help doe see the importance of a robust us presence in that experiment and sluo can help articulate that message the long term goal of lepton based hep is of course the construction of a large linear collider recent events have shown however the mistake of focusing on one long term goal slac needs an active and diverse hep experimental program in the short and medium term if there is to be a long term and as sluo executive i will work for that
