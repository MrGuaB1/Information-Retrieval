the paradise project the paradise project screen snapshot of paradise clouds screen snapshot from the paradise simulator the paradise performance architecture for advanced distributed interactive simulation environments project aims to architect and build a large scale internetworked simulation environment that would support multi player interactive 3d simulations running over a wide area network example applications of such an infrastructure include military battlefield training and weapons testing such as the dis distributed interactive simulation exercises multiplayer games amusement park rides collaborative design and many others we currently have version 0.1 of the paradise software running on ibm aix workstations it includes a 3d visual display engine and allows multiple entities to move about and see each other in one integrated simulation environment it includes a simple terrain display engine that performs polygon clipping and some simple effort to speed up display through multiple resolution terrain models version 0.1 of the software incorporates sandeep singhal's dead reckoning protocols and algorithms to allow for smooth motion even with low frame rate transmissions it also incorporates an implementation of hugh holbrook's area of interest aoi directory service for distributing information about entities and their multicast groups mark tsimelzon's distributed collision detection protocol is currently being developed and tested in this environment the paradise project is one project of the stanford distributed systems group led by professor david cheriton paradise project members sandeep singhal working on dead reckoning and entity aggregation hugh holbrook working on reliable logging and a multicast channel directory service mark tsimelzon working on fast accurate distributed collision detection with minimal perceptual discrepancies eric halpern working on modeling meteorological effects matt zelesko working on high performance ecommunication in a dis environment his specific work focuses on an object oriented rpc library publications sk singhal and dr cheriton using a position history based protocol for distributed object visualization chapter 10 of designing real time graphics for entertainment course notes for siggraph 94 course 14 7 94 also available as stanford university computer science technical report stan cs tr 94 1505 february 1994 compressed postscript or abstract distributed interactive simulation slides from an introductory talk given at stanford in cs244b june 1 1995 gzipped postscript hw holbrook sk singhal and dr cheriton log based receiver reliable multicast for distributed interactive simulation proceedings of sigcomm 95 328 341 published as computer communications review vol 25 no 4 october 1995 postscript abstract for group members only only available from within the dsg contents include papers in progress how to run the paradise demo how to take a screen dump of the paradise demo related information a partial list of projects available within the paradise project good for beginning graduate students related work web sites containing information related to the paradise project conferences some relevant conferences related to our work workshop on simulation and interaction in virtual environments home page siggraph hugh holbrook holbrook at dsg dot stanford dot edu sandeep singhal singhal at dsg dot stanford dot edu
