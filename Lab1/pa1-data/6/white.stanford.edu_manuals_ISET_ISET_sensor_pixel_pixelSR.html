description of pixelsr home iset sensor pixel pixelsr m pixelsr purpose pixel response spectral responsivity sr as a function of wavelength synopsis function sr pixelsr pixel description pixel response spectral responsivity sr as a function of wavelength sr pixelsr pixel the sr measure has units of volts watt the measurement is basically the same as spectral quantum efficiency but measured with respect to input energy of the light rather than quanta sr lambda lambda q h c qe lambda where q is the charge electron h is planck's constant c is the speed of light lambda is the wavelength of the in put and qe is the spectral quantum efficiency copyright imageval consultants llc 2005 cross reference information this function calls pixelget get data from the pixel structure this function is called by pixelget get data from the pixel structure generated on tue 10 jan 2012 21 55 33 by m2html 2005
