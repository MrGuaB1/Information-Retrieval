image mapping on www cs staff the much improved imagemap script an imagemap is the mechanism for allowing clickable regions on an image to result in different pages there are four components an image map program the server has one installed in cgi bin an image file to click on a map file to convert points on the image into urls a html file to link the image and the map file the image file is a gif file or some other type of graphic that can be displayed using an img src image file tag the map file is described below as is the html code needed to link the image and the map file the basic idea is the user views the html file containing the image the user clicks somewhere on the image causing a connection to be made to the server this starts up the image map program on the server the program reads the map file specified as part of the url and use the map file to convert the coordinate of the click into a url and finally tells mosaic the url to load in response to the click the map configuration file this file maps regions in the image to urls for the given image lines beginning with are comments every other non blank line consists of the following method url coord1 coord2 coordn coord are each coordinates format x y the number of coordinates depends on method method is one of the following circle for a circle coordinates center edgepoint circle http www pcd stanford edu 30 30 10 55 poly for a polygon of at most 100 vertices each coordinate is a vertex poly html simple html 32 31 10 10 29 10 rect for a rectangle coordinates upper left lower right rect mogens intro fish map 10 23 30100 url is one of the following a virtual pathname to a file on the server ie a relative url without the http hostname part a full url note each method is evaluated in the order it is placed in the configuration file if you have overlapping areas such as a circle inside of a rectangle you should place whichever one you want evaluated first before the other in the map file in this case we would put the circle before the rectangle using your new map to reference your new map you construct urls pointing to it using the imagemap program in the cgi bin directory the urls look like this http www cs staff stanford edu cgi bin ismap yourname map file name and you wrap that url using an image map image like so a href http www cs staff stanford edu cgi bin ismap yourname map file name img src some gif ismap a in other words the anchor contains an image which has the magic word ismap embedded in the tag this will cause the browser to place the coordinates of the click after the url before calling the ismap program for example http www pcd stanford edu cgi bin ismap is the program name http www pcd stanford edu mogens intro fish map is the map file http www pcd stanford edu mogens intro fish33 gif is the picture http www pcd stanford edu mogens intro imagedemo html is the html document that will contain the clickable image a href http www pcd stanford edu cgi bin ismap mogens intro fish map img src fish33 gif ismap a a complete example the map configuration file used for this picture was rather lengthy rob used xv to get the coordinates the completed picture allows you to click on the objects in the picture and get descriptions of the object webmaster cs stanford edu
