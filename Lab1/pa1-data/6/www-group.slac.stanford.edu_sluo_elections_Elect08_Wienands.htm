uli wienands uli wienands slac national acceleratory laboratory with the shutdown of pep ii babar sluo's role is changing slac is already quite involved in off site programs this trend will likely accelerate as an accelerator physicist i see us actively promoting collaborations on a world wide scale aiming at becoming key players in off site accelerator projects while pursuing plans for on site facilities sluo can and should work with the laboratory possibly even with the funding agencies to communicate the needs to be addressed in the interest of fostering efficient global collaboration and communication slac's role as premier accelerator research laboratory and the continuing attraction of young researchers to work on challenging issues in accelerator physics and engineering rest on these collaborations and sluo should promote this aspect of slac's mission vigorously with the change in focus at slac sluo also needs to consider its relationship to the photon science program and its user organizations ssrluo and lcls uo we need to explore areas of overlapping interest where a joint approach may lead to greater effectiveness in communication with laboratory management i came to the stanford linear accelerator center in 1994 after 9 years at triumf and a brief 1.5 years at the ssc with a background in experimental nuclear physics my career in accelerator physics has spanned from designing accelerators to building and running them having been pep ii run coordinator for almost 4 of its 9 years of running with babar as of this writing i am leading a task force organizing the transition of lcls to operation and am coordinating a uslarp effort getting involved in the r&d studies for the lhc injector upgrade besides participating in superb and pep x design studies
