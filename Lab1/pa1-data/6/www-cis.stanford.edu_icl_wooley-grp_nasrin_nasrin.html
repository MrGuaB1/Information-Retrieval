nasrin jaffari's research page low noise x ray readout system faculty bruce wooley student nasrin jaffari research summary in recent years high resolution x ray detection systems have been used extensively in a variety of scientific fields such as protein crystallography x ray fluorescence analysis of substances xrf and particle physics studies x ray incidents are sensed and their energy measured by means of a semiconductor detector readout system each x ray incident on a semiconductor diode creates electron hole pairs which are transferred to the readout system and are then converted to a digital signal x ray energies vary greatly depending on the application for instance protein crystallography commonly uses x rays with energy of around 12kev small angle x ray scattering saxs which is used in the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory ssrl uses x rays with energies of 8kev and below xrf applications generally employ a wide range of x rays with energies as low as 200ev the resolution of x ray detection systems depend highly on the noise of the readout electronics in order to be able to detect low energy levels the noise of the readout system must be low the goal of this project is to reduce the minimum noise level using new circuit techniques a survey of literature on x ray detector systems shows that current x ray detector systems have a minimum noise of about 100enc hopefully this thesis will be able to reduce the noise of the readout system to below 50enc education ph d electrical engineering stanford university 2008 present ms electrical engineering stanford university 2006 2008 bs electrical engineering and computer science university of california at berkeley 2000 2004 contact information center for integrated systems 065 via ortega & via pueblo stanford university stanford ca 94305 ic lab integrated circuits lab cis center for integrated systems stanford stanford university home people projects publications links e mail cis home page ic lab
