secure ip tunnelling next up previous next remote login and up secure non local access previous secure non local access secure ip tunnelling to support users who regularly work at home or trusted collaborators at other schools we need to connect isolated sites and give them unrestricted access to all internal machines we assume that the campus internetwork which is presumed to be insecure will be used as the primary conduit to provide users with access from home machines to connect two isolated sites that are protected and mutually trusting we establish a secure ip tunnel between them arbitrary ip packets are then encapsulated and tunnelled between the two sites we chose to use ioannidis swipe protocol 18 to implement an authenticated encrypted ip tunnel the endpoints of the tunnel are known and the filter ensures that incoming swipe packets are actually part of an already registered tunnel alternatively we can support a dedicated connection either leased line or modem between two sites protected by their own firewalls for example our security enclave includes a subnet directly connected via leased line in the home of a faculty member however due to cost considerations secure network connections are not generally feasible sandeep singhal thu nov 30 01 58 58 pst 1995
