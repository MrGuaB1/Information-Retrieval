research themes investigated at the design observatory home background researchers research themes previous work what's new fundamental questions what are designers doing thinking and feeling when they do design how can we improve their performance early mistakes 1984 1990 premature focus on computational tools instead of communication tools exclusive focus on the individual instead of the individual and the team failure to investigate differences between analysis thinking and synthesis thinking current areas of research design documentation and information reuse electronic notebooks social and cognitive aspects of design information handling behavior question asking individual differences team diversity and composition motivation and attention design communication sketching gesturing hardware manipulation distributed team design physical and virtual spaces cross disciplinary and cross functional design mechatronics biodesign design education design thinking synthesis and analysis coaching management of design teams innovation management computational simulation research threads focus on early stage conceptual design focus on teams focus on realistic situations development of tools and methods to improve the process
