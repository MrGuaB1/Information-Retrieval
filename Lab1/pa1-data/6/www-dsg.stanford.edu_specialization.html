application specialization of communication application specialization of communication emerging new distributed applications present new demands on communication services such applications include internet multimedia distributed interactive simulation dis and distributed parallel simulation requiring functionality and performance that is not available from conventional communication systems conventional communication architectures are constrained to a small set of static protocols defined by the operating system object oriented class library support for communication channels and rpc provide applications with direct control over the implementation of each level of the communication hierarchy sophisticated communication classes can be specialized from standard implementations to address the particular flexibility and performance requirements of various applications for example dis environments require a reliable multicast capability to disseminate state information while distributed parallel simulations may require high performance streaming of simulation objects specialization of the communication class libraries enables each application to achieve its own particular requirements use of the object oriented class library support for communication coupled with a high performance network layer such as the virtual address space switching architecture vassa provide a communications architecture that is efficient and yet flexible enough to support the wide range of emerging distributed applications matt at dsg dot stanford dot edu last modified fri aug 18 09 02 16 1995
