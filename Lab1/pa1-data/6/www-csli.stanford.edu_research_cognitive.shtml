csli cognitive science lab research in the cognitive sciences these interdisciplinary projects cover a broad range of topics in computer science linguistics logic and semantics philosophy psychology and education action information and cognition the project on action information and cognition is aimed at exploring the foundation of intelligent information guided and goal oriented behavior as it is exhibited in both natural organisms such as humans and artificial agents the goal of the project is a unified theory of the role of information in intelligent behavior david israel john perry and syun tutiya business applications of situation theory the business applications of situation theory bast project sets out to develop a fundamental understanding of information and a set of conceptual tools and analytic methodologies to manage information efficiently much of the work to date has involved the development and application of tools to analyze and organize communications data obtained in the workplace keith devlin the computational metaphysics project in this project philosophers at stanford berkeley and elsewhere are implementing various principles of axiomatic metaphysics in an automated reasoning environment many of the results are obtained within the the axiomatic theory of abstract objects developed at the metaphysics research lab at stanford university but we also study other formal metaphysical theories and arguments the basic idea is to represent the axioms or premises of theories or arguments in the syntax of an automated reasoning system such as prover9 or the e prover system these systems often discover simpler proofs of theorems or conclusions they can verify hand proved theorems and find mistakes of reasoning by building countermodels edward zalta dynamic logic and information flow the project aims at developing a mathematical logical account of the structure of meaningful information and its useful transformations in cognition and communication the emphasis is on two major aspects dynamics of processes and the informational complexities of many person interactions johan van benthem grammatical complexity this project studies what leads people to choose one word order over another when both are acceptable it is known that people tend to place simple phrases before complex ones and old information before new information but the relevant notions of complexity and newness have not been made precise and it is not known what other factors might affect ordering thomas a wasow head driven phrase structure grammar the hpsg project is developing mathematically precise grammars and lexicons of a variety of human languages its analyses of english contribute directly to the on line grammars developed by the lingo project ivan sag lexical acquisition in language development the lexical acquisition project is studying the kinds of pragmatic information about meaning offered to young children by adults and also the extent to which children take up this information one goal is to chart the range of inferences children make and the uses they put them to in the process of acquiring word meanings eve clark lexical functional grammar joan bresnan mary dalrymple ron kaplan tracy king chris manning peter sells plus affiliated student reearchers to be named spatial thought and language our research focuses on how people represent the space of the body the space around the body the space of navigation the temporal space of action the space of depiction how do people describe those spaces and understand those descriptions barbara tversky home research publications affiliates events people information copyright 1995 2010 the board of trustees of the leland stanford junior university all rights reserved inquiries about csli may be directed to csli csli stanford edu comments about or corrections of the web pages may be directed to csli webmaster csli stanford edu last modified fri oct 13 09 40 09 pdt 2006 by emma csli stanford edu
