maryam fathi's research page high power cmos rf power amplifier faculty bruce wooley student maryam fathi research summary cmos is an attractive technology for integrating different rf blocks due to its low cost and high yield however designing power amplifiers in cmos faces a lot of challenges including low breakdown voltage of the transistors and high loss of on chip passive components these problems become more significant in submicron cmos processes the objective of this research is to explore the design of efficient power amplifiers with high output power capability in cmos publication m fathi dk su and ba wooley a stacked 6.5 ghz 29.6 dbm power amplifier in standard 65 nm cmos ieee custom integrated circuits conference september 2010 education ph d candidate in electrical engineering stanford university ms electrical engineering sharif university of technology tehran iran 2005 bs electrical engineering sharif university of technology tehran iran 2003 contact information paul g allen building 33 420 via palou mall stanford university stanford ca 94305 4070 email fathi stanford edu ic lab integrated circuits lab cis center for integrated systems stanford stanford university home people projects publications links e mail cis home page ic lab
