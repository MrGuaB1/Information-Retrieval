undersea cable costs long distance cable costs ever wonder how much a long distance cable costs apparently the costs to rent a slice of a long distance cable from at&t or mci are quite high a 1000km oc 3 150mbps link may cost in the neighborhood of $1000000 per year for terrestrial cables i would guess that undersea cables are much more expensive to rent but how much does it cost at&t to install one of these cables undersea cables this table lists some undersea cables their speed estimated total cost cost per km and cost per megabit cable bandwidth length km project cost cost km cost gbps km completion date tat 9 565mbps 9310 $450 m $48355 $85548 march 1992 tpc 4 560mbps 9860 $373 m $37830 $67553 oct 1992 cios 622mbps 261 $10 m $38314 $61598 late 1993 tpc 5 5gbps max 20 25000 $1.12 b $44800 $8960 late 1996 flag 10gbps 27000 $1500 m $56000 $5600 1997 columbus iii 10gbps 11000 $300 m $27000 $2700 july 1999 my source for this data is primarily press reports on the web from the companies laying the cables primarily at&t click on the cable names in the first column to see the press reports summary the short answer is that undersea cable costs about $50000 per km to install independent of the speed of the cable in the last 5 years there is a very clear trend the cost per gigabit has steadily dropped and is now a factor of 10 20 less than what it was in 1992 this cost reduction appears entirely due to the huge increase in cable bandwidths more info see the at&t technical journal volume 74 no 1 jan feb 1995 for an interesting issue about undersea cables also visit the international cable protection committee for a list of all undersea cables wired magazine had a fascinating article in early 1997 by neal stephenson about laying the flag cable i don t have the exact link to it but a net search should turn it up hugh holbrook holbrook at dsg dot stanford dot edu
