a hierarchical illumination algorithm for surfaces with glossy reflection a hierarchical illumination algorithm for surfaces with glossy reflection larry aupperle and pat hanrahan proceedings of siggraph 1993 abstract we develop a radiance formulation for discrete three point transport and a new measure and description of reflectance area reflectance this formulation and associated reflectance allow an estimate of error in the computation of radiance across triples of surface elements and lead directly to a hierarchical refinement algorithm for global illumination we have implemented and analyzed this algorithm over surfaces exhibiting glossy specular and diffuse reflection theoretical growth in light transport interactions is shown to be o n log n for sufficient refinement where n is the number of elements at the finest level of subdivision within the environment in trials this growth has been nearly linear naive implementation of three point transport would require o n 3 element triple interactions additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper 6 mb fig01 tif fig02 tif fig03 tif fig04 tif fig05 tif fig06 tif fig07 tif fig08 tif fig09col tif fig09r1 tif fig09r2 tif fig09r3 tif fig10 tif fig11v1 tif fig11v2 tif fig12 tif table1 tif back up to papers index
