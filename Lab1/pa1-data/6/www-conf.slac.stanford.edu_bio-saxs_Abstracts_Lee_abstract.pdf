assembly and maturation of viral capsids probed by time resolved saxs kelly k lee university of washington viral capsids form page 1 assembly and maturation of viral capsids probed by time resolved saxs kelly k lee university of washington viral capsids form a protective shell composed of hundreds of protein subunits that encapsidate the genetic material of viruses including both non enveloped eg bacteriophages adenovirus rhinovirus etc and enveloped eg herpes simplex virus hiv etc formation of the correct final assembly is dependent upon staged polymerization of subunits followed in many cases by a maturation step that converts an assembly facile but labile immature assembly intermediate into a mature robust and infectious final capsid these stages of the viral life cycle can be targets for antiviral inhibition arresting the formation of infectious particles small angle x ray scattering is well suited to characterize both assembly and maturation due to its sensitivity to solute size and conformation we have carried out static and time resolved saxs experiments that reveal that maturation of already formed bacteriophage capsids takes place as highly cooperative two state switching transitions assembly studies of hepatitis b virus capsids reveal a more complex series of polymerization steps proceeding from dimer subunits to intermediate polymers which then appear to convert to capsids in a cooperative fashion
