wsl wireless systems lab wireless systems lab welcome wireless technology has enormous potential to change the way people and things communicate future wireless networks will allow people on the move to communicate with anyone anywhere and at any time using a range of high performance multimedia services wireless video will support applications such as enhanced social networking distance learning and remote medicine wireless sensor networks can also enable a new class of intelligent home electronics smart and energy efficient buildings and highways and in body networks for analysis and treatment of medical conditions fortunately for us researchers there are many technical challenges that must be met in order to make this vision a reality these challenges transcend all levels of the overall system design including hardware communication link design wireless networking distributed sensing communication and control and cross layer design in addition synergies between the hardware link and network designs must be exploited in order to meet the demanding performance requirements of these future systems the wireless systems lab wsl investigates broad areas of wireless system design to meet these technical challenges specific research areas within the lab include wireless information and communication theory capacity and fundamental performance limits of wireless channels and networks spatial degrees of freedom mimo in cellular and ad hoc wireless networks base station and node cooperation in cellular systems generalized relaying and cooperation in wireless ad hoc networks green wireless system design cognitive radio networks wireless sensor networks compressed sensing in wireless systems distributed sensing communications and control applications of communications and signal processing to bioengineering and neuroscience welcome research areas funded projects people publications courses links group meetings schedule login comments to webmaster wsl stanford edu
