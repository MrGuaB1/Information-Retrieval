a rapid hierarchical radiosity algorithm for unoccluded environments a rapid hierarchical radiosity algorithm for unoccluded environments pat hanrahan and david salzman eurographics 1990 abstract this paper presents a linear time radiosity algorithm for scenes containing large mutually unoccluded polygonal patches it subdivides pairs of patches adaptively to build a hierarchical data structure with n elements at the leaves and it encodes all the light transport between component polygonal elements given a required numerical precision determined here by the specified bounds for maximum solid angle f_ epsilon and minimum area a_ epsilon our algorithm reduces the number of form factor calculations and interactions to o n in the worst case and o sqrt n in the best case standard techniques for shooting and gathering can then be used with the data structure the best previous radiosity algorithms represented the element to element transport interactions with n 2 form factors additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper 556k eps back up to papers index
