real time volume rendering on shared memory multiprocessors using the shear warp factorization real time volume rendering on shared memory multiprocessors using the shear warp factorization philippe lacroute to appear in proc 1995 parallel rendering symposium atlanta georgia october 30 31 1995 abstract this paper presents a new parallel volume rendering algorithm that can render 256 3 voxel medical data sets at over 10 hz and 128 3 voxel data sets at over 30 hz on a 16 processor silicon graphics challenge the algorithm achieves these results by minimizing each of the three components of execution time computation time synchronization time and data communication time computation time is low because the parallel algorithm is based on the recently reported shear warp serial volume rendering algorithm which is over five times faster than previous serial algorithms synchronization time is minimized by using dynamic load balancing and a task partition that minimizes synchronization events data communication costs are low because the algorithm is implemented for shared memory multiprocessors a class of machines with hardware support for low latency fine grain communication and hardware caching to hide latency we draw two conclusions from our implementation first we find that on shared memory architectures data redistribution and communication costs do not dominate rendering time second we find that cache locality requirements impose a limit on parallelism in volume rendering algorithms specifically our results indicate that shared memory machines with hundreds of processors would be useful only for rendering very large data sets additional information available latex of full paper 62k bytes postscript of full paper without color plate 428k bytes lossless tiff of figure 2 47k bytes lossless tiff of figure 3 290k bytes volpack volume rendering library
