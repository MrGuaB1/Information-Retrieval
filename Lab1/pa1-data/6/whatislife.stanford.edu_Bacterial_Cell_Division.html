bacterial cell division carolina tropini sandhya sinha how does a bacterial cell organize its interior in the past decade intracellular fluorescence microscopy has fashioned a new appreciation for the diversity of ways in which proteins organize and segregate on bacterial membranes though some targeting anchors are known cellular symmetry breaking ultimately requires molecular components that self organize the remarkable accuracy of cell division in e coli and related bacteria is partially regulated by the min protein system which prevents division near the cell ends by oscillating spatially from pole to pole we have developed a model of the min system using only known properties of the proteins which accurately reproduces the observed oscillations in both rod shaped and round cells in particular we have shown that min protein oscillations can select the long axis in nearly round cells a potentially important factor in division plane selection in round bacteria such as neisseria gonnorhoeae these results suggest that oscillations may provide a general mechanism by which proteins can localize in response to features of cell geometry incapable of localizing individual molecules back to research main page modeling and experiment demonstrate that the min proteins can find the poles even in aberrantly shaped e coli a minimal reaction diffusion system reproduces min protein oscillation dynamics bacterial cell divison kchuang lab 318 campus drive west clark center e372 stanford ca 94305
