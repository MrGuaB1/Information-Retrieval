avoiding crumpled paper when printing from backface avoiding crumpled paper when printing from backface from eric veach to glab graphics stanford edu subject avoiding crumpled paper on backface date wed 20 aug 1997 10 35 30 0700 pdt for the past couple of months backface has not been behaving very well it often puts big creases in the paper in my experience about 1 page out of 4 well there is a simple trick to avoid this problem load the paper upside down i got this one out of the printer manual of all places it turns out that one side of the paper is smoother than the other and the printer is sensitive to this so here are the detailed instructions 1 the reams of paper ie those packages of 500 sheets have a seam on one side the natural thing to do is to open the package with this seam facing up 2 take the paper out and flip it over as you put it into the printer of course you could open it with the same facing down but this is more awkward which is why people have consistently been loading the paper the wrong way a true testimonial last night backface was crumpling about 1 page in 3 after flipping the paper over as suggested by the manual it printed over 100 pages without any problems happy printing eric
