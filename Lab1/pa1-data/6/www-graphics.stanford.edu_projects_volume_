volume rendering volume rendering volume rendering is a technique for directly displaying a sampled 3d scalar field without first fitting geometric primitives to the samples we are working on developing efficient and accurate algorithms for displaying this sort of data our goal is photorealistic real time volume rendering of usefully large scientific engineering and medical datasets on affordable noncustom hardware we have also worked on techniques for morphing volumes the project represented by this web page has been inactive for several years however there are two new efforts related to volume rendering that are currently going on in our laboratory the first is a project to incorporate volume rendering into the stanford real time programmable shading language and to build a parallelized volume renderer for our 32 processor pc cluster this project is under the direction of pat hanrahan the second is a project to create a book of volume renderings tentatively called volumegraphica if you re a stanford student interested in working on this project talk to marc levoy people chase garfinkle cgar cs stanford edu phil lacroute lacroute weevil stanford edu apostolos lerios tolis cs stanford edu marc levoy recent papers in this area real time volume rendering on shared memory multiprocessors using the shear warp factorization philippe lacroute proc 1995 parallel rendering symposium feature based volume metamorphosis apostolos lerios chase d garfinkle and marc levoy proc siggraph 95 fast volume rendering using a shear warp factorization of the viewing transformation philippe lacroute and marc levoy proc siggraph 94 frequency domain volume rendering takashi totsuka and marc levoy proc siggraph 93 some older papers display of surfaces from volume data marc levoy ieee computer graphics and applications vol 8 no 3 may 1988 click here for an historical note about the error in this paper a hybrid ray tracer for rendering polygon and volume data marc levoy ieee computer graphics and applications vol 10 no 2 march 1990 pp 33 40 efficient ray tracing of volume data marc levoy a acm transactions on graphics vol 9 no 3 july 1990 pp 245 261 volume rendering by adaptive refinement marc levoy the visual computer vol 6 no 1 february 1990 pp 2 7 volume rendering in radiation treatment planning marc levoy et al proc first conference on visualization in biomedical computing ieee computer society press atlanta georgia may 1990 pp 4 10 available software and data the volpack volume rendering library the stanford volume data archive demos sample volume renderings made using the volpack volume rendering library several 3d volume morphs miscellaneous mostly old volume renderings made by marc levoy if images on this page look dark to you see our note about gamma correction a list of technical papers with abstracts and pointers to additional information is also available or you can return to the research projects page or our home page copyright 1995 marc levoy last update february 19 2006 09 35 57 pm
