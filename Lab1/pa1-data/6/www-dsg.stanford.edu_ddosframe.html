defense against distributed denial of service attacks distributed systems group research distributed systems group research active internet traffic filtering scalable defense against distributed denial of service attacks student katerina argyraki distributed denial of service ddos attacks are an acute contemporary problem with few practical solutions available today one key reason why such attacks are hard to block is the large number of attack sources which can be orders of magnitude higher than the number of filters available at the victim's firewall wire speed filters are typically stored in expensive power hungry tcam today the most sophisticated hardware router accommodates a few hundred thousand filters while an attack can involve millions of attack sources evenly distributed across internet prefixes if the victim's firewall cannot block attack traffic by itself the straightforward solution is to push filtering of attack traffic back into the internet core unfortunately this approach does not scale because it introduces end to end filtering state into core routers yet there are enough filtering resources in the internet to block large scale attacks they are located close to the attack sources active internet traffic filtering aitf leverages this observation and enables the victim to i identify routers located close to the attack sources and ii make them block their misbehaving clients we use a hardware friendly variant of route record to limit source address spoofing and provide the victim with a list of border routers that forward attack traffic upon identifying an undesired flow the victim sends a filtering request to its gateway the victim's gateway temporarily blocks the undesired flow and identifies the border router located closest to the attack source s call it the attack gateway then the victim's gateway initiates a counter connection setup with the attack gateway ie an agreement not to transmit certain packets as soon as the counter connection setup is completed the victim's gateway can remove its temporary filter if the attack gateway does not cooperate the victim's gateway can escalate the filtering request to the next border router closest to the attack gateway escalation can continue recursively until a router along the attack path responds and a counter connection setup is completed if no router responds attack traffic is blocked locally by the victim's gateway however aitf both assists and motivates routers close to the attack source s to help block attack traffic aitf enables a victim to have an undesired flow blocked within milliseconds also an aitf enabled router can block millions of flows with tens of thousands of filters and a few megabytes of dram resources easly accommodated by today's routers finally aitf can be deployed incrementally and yields a concrete benefit even to the very first adopters detailed description and evaluation in active internet traffic filtering real time response to denial of service attacks with david r cheriton in usenix annual technical conference april 2005 html pdf hardware friendly route record and how it can help block ddos discussed in loose source routing as a mechanism for traffic policies in the acm sigcomm future directions in network architecture fdna workshop august 2004 pdf slides last updated on feb 25 2005
