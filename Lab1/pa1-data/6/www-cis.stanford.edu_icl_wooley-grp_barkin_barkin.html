dave barkin's research page d a conversion for wide band communications systems faculty bruce wooley student david barkin ongoing research oversampled d a for communications systems standard radio transmitter designs generally include digital processing and waveshaping followed by a multi bit nyquist rate d a converter the output of this converter is then filtered by continuous time low pass filters in the analog domain removing images of the baseband signal in order to comply with transmit spectral mask requirements the signal is then mixed to an intermediate frequency for further analog processing while this technique is widely used it generally requires complex off chip analog filters following the d a converter in my research i am studying implementation tradoffs in the baseband to if transmit chain for relatively wideband channels the digital nature of an oversampled delta sigma d a converter allows a great deal of flexibility in choice of converter topology as well as noise transfer function this flexibility is being used in order to design converters with noise transfer functions suitable for 8 10 bits resolution at signal bandwidths greater than 1mhz education ph d candidate in electrical engineering stanford university ms electrical engineering stanford university ab electrical engineering harvard university 1997 contact information center for integrated systems 072 stanford university stanford ca 94305 4070 650 725 4542 email barkin leland stanford edu stanford cis ic lab integrated circuits lab last modified mon nov 1 11 29 36 pdt 1999 home people projects publications links e mail cis home page ic lab
