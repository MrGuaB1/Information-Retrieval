jews nixon kissinger and disraeli back to index jews nixon kissinger and disraeli nixon made many harsh anti semitic remarks but among others cameron sawyer puts them in context by all accounts see for example the memoirs of both men the relationship between nixon and kissinger was warm and close on a personal as well as professional level and who said nixon was a notorious anti semite just because he said some by our standards indiscreet things and identified hostile forces in the media with liberal jews doesn t mean that he hated jews in general or was incapable of seeing kissinger or any other particular jew as an individual and appreciating his abilities likewise cameron rises to the defense of disraeli likewise disraeli who casts a giant shadow over 19th century british politics was genuinely appreciated by a wide swath of the political establishment in victorian britain why it was disraeli who practically single handedly reformed and reestablished the conservative party i don t believe flattery was the main part of his relationship to the queen i suspect that rather the extremely charming disraeli was being modest in telling the story like that by the way disraeli was a christian in form only he was quite proud of his heritage i love the response attributed to disraeli apocryphally in response to an anti semitic remark made obliquely in his direction in the commons when the gentleman s ancestors were herding swine in scandinavia mine were receiving the holy tablets from the deity on mount sinai my comment i am glad to have this explanation of disraeli's trowel remark i am not sure that he was a christian in form only jews for jesus are not christians in form only kurt reinhart of stanford was a converted jew but he was a devout and leading catholic ronald hilton 3 11 02 webmaster
