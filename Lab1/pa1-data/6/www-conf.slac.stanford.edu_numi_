numi off axis experiment detector workshop home january 24 26 2003 stanford california numi off axis experiment detector workshop minos and workshop logo numi neutrino beam currently under construction offers an unique opportunity for detailed studies of the neutrino oscillation this beam offers a particularly interesting opportunity for a very sensitive search for numu to nue oscillations which can provide a variety of new physics insights in the neutrino sector including the pattern of neutrino mass hierarchy measurement of the hereto poorly constrained mixing angle theta13 and perhaps cp violation the primary goal of the workshop will be to review the ongoing and past relevant r&d efforts as well as the current state of the knowledge of potential detector technologies for a numi offaxis experiment we plan to hold sessions dedicated to all proposed detector technologies tracking calorimeter with liquid scintillator tracking calorimeter with gas detectors liquid argon tpc water cherenkov it is expected that the proponents of the different technologies will contribute to the organization of the sessions dealing with their topic we hope to be able to cover as completely as possible all the relevant aspects of the experiment a desirable outcome of the workshop would be convergence on a coherent plan of action toward preparation of the proposal for the experiment this would probably necessitate a decision on one or two technologies to determine which one we would like to carry to the proposal stage it is hoped that the workshop will allow us to evaluate the relative merits of the different proposed solutions so that such a decision could be made slac logo stanford linear accelerator center 2575 sand hill road menlo park ca 94025 contact the organizing committee adam para 630.840 2132 judy meo 650.926 2805 melodi masaniai 650.926 3171 stan wojcicki 650.926 2806
