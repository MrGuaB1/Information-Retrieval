a brief overview of verilog next event graph representation up a general method for previous introduction a brief overview of verilog all verilog programs are composed of modules these modules may be instantiated inside of other modules to create a hierarchy that represents the structure of the hardware system modules contain three types of concurrent process statements initial blocks always blocks and continuous assignments initial blocks are executed once at the beginning of the simulation while always blocks are executed repeatedly initial and always blocks consist of statements that are executed sequentially and each can wait on a signal to change value using wait or statements a continuous assignment is an assignment to a wire whose left hand side continuously reflects the current state of the variables on the right hand side a verilog simulator simulates a model sequentially by removing events from an event queue executing the events and placing new events on the queue as they become activated verisuif supports a subset of verilog we do not support tasks functions fork join or the disable statement however we do not foresee any difficulty in extending our system to handle these features next event graph representation up a general method for previous introduction robert french
