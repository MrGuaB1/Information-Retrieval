multi graphics multigraphics scalable and distributed graphics and visualization using commodity graphics components summary the architecture of graphics systems is at a major crossroad the large market for games and entertainment applications has resulted in major investments in graphics chip technologies the result is that state of the art graphics chips eg the nvidia geforce2 and the sony playstation 2000 ee and gs chips have similar complexity and greater computational density than current microprocessors the challenge now for the scientific community is to build high performance scalable graphics systems out of inexpensive high performance components moreover since graphics capabilities are now widely available it is time also to rethink how graphics resources are composed and partitioned across a variety of networks san lan wan in this project we are investigating technologies for building scalable graphics systems using commodity components specifically we want to develop efficient systems for driving new display configurations such as tiled arrays of projectors for generating and receiving remote graphics streams and for partitioning and reconfiguring heterogeneous graphics and display resources the resulting set of capabilities we call multi graphics as part of this project we are building a visualization cluster consisting of 32 pcs with commodity graphics cards people pat hanrahan ian buck matthew eldridge greg humphreys brad johanson matthew everett undergraduate research assistant susan shepard maureen stone alumni dan schwarz chris niederauer papers distributed rendering for scalable displays sc2000 tracking graphics state for networked rendering eurographics siggraph workshop on graphics hardware 2000 a distributed graphics system for large tiled displays ieee visualization 1999 talks views pi meeting presentation may 2000 software wiregl software for tiled rendering new version 1.2 mar 7 2001 related projects interactive workspaces project scalable rendering project support this project is supported by the doe views program
