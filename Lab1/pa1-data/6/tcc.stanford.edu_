tcc transactional coherence and consistency tcc people project prototypes software publications more info transactional coherence and consistency transactional coherence and consistency tcc offers a way to simplify parallel programming by executing all code in transactions in tcc systems transactions serve as the fundamental unit of parallel work communication and coherence as each transaction completes it writes all of its newly produced state to shared memory atomically while restarting other processors that have speculatively read from modified data with this mechanism a tcc based system automatically handles data synchronization correctly without programmer intervention to gain the benefits of tcc programs must be decomposed into transactions decomposing a program into transactions is largely a matter of performance tuning rather than correctness and that a few basic transaction programming optimization techniques are sufficient to obtain good performance over a wide range of applications with little programmer effort for an overview of our research see our overview presentation for more details see our publications presentations and talks this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no 0444470 16 march 2008 contact
