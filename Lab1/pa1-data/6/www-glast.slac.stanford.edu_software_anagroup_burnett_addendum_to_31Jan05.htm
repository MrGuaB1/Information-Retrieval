addendum to 31jan05 presentation addendum to 31jan05 presentation 02 feb 2005 this is a small addendum to my talk to the ana group bill atwood pointed out that the evaluation of the decision tree was flawed it used the same data to evaluate the separation as was used to create the tree this is bad since the procedure is sensitive to the training set i responded that i had limited nodes to have at least 100 events but did not know the answer to his question so here are some results i train on only the even events in the all_gamma data set then run the evaluation on three data sets the even events which should show the bias the odd events which should be unbiased uncorrelated events choosing the next entry in the tuple which should show no correlation the plot follows conclusions the testing sample using events not used for training is worse but not by much since the end nodes were limited to 100 events applying the good gamma prediction to the wrong events has no effect the result is really uncorrelated toby burnett
