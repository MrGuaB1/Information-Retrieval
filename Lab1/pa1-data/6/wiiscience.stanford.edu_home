welcome wiiscience search this site home about projects for researchers for students wiiscience welcome the wii science project leverages a familiar technology physical video game controllers to engage students in collecting and analysing data to learn about the world by traversing the boudaries between informal play and structured learning physically engaging gaming technologies such as the wiimote can not only tap into students embodied understanding of the physics of motion but can also enable them to consider the technical tools they use every day for other inventive purposes by exploring underlying technical systems and the data streams they emit students not only gain and understanding of physics but also become more fluent with the technical devices and systems that increasingly surround them and through which they engage with each other in physical and digital worlds funded by a grant from the wallenberg global learning network he wii science project is a partnership between swedish and us universities and schools our goal is to develop robust and deployable materials that will enable educators in a variety of settings to incorporate affordable accessible physical game controllers into school programs and curricula this website presents the us partnership between stanford university and the nueva school's 6th grade physics class join us we are looking for teachers who are interested in helping us further develop test or refine this curriculum if you are interested in learning more about the project or using wii science materials in your classroom please contact us write to sarahl at stanford edu username password create new account request new password rss
