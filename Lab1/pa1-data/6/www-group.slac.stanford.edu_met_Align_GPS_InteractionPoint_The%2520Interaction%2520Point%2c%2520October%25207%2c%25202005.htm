the interaction point october 7 2005 october 7 2005 gps collaboration adds slac to plate boundary observatory by brian fuss slac has joined the solid earth research community after months of discussions and organization between frederick blume of the university navstar consortium unavco catherine lecocq aeg and operations director john cornuelle coo slac's global positioning system gps base station was added as a significant contributor to the plate boundary observatory pbo on september 26th this geodetic program is part of the earthscope project funded by the national science foundation studying the three dimensional strain field resulting from deformation across active plate boundaries in the western united states the pacific and north american plates are observed using an array of gps receivers and strainmeters deducing the strain field with varying timescales ranging from days to decades lecocq looks at this cooperation as another example of slac's expanding interest in new areas of scientific study we will have a fully maintained gps base station with limited cost to slac plus the satisfaction of contributing to unavco's high precision geodetic network of gps stations this station has been used for the past three years to map features of the slac campus for cef and for various projects such as lcls the real time data generated by the base station can be seen at http slac bard cn2002 pbo data net and further information on unavco can be found at http www unavco org the stanford linear accelerator center is managed by stanford university for the us department of energy
