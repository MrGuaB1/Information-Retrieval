basic topics in experimental computer science page 1 basic topics in experimental computer science 1997 jun 24 5 46 pm abstract computer science has an experimental scientific aspect like every other science experiments are made with suitable computer programs in order to discover facts the programs are usually not applications but specialized to the scientific problem being investigated it is a mistake to divide computer science simply into theoretical and applied parts basic computer science has both theoretical and applied parts applied computer science certainly has an experimental part and presumably it has a theoretical part also we wouldn t expect to have to tell you this unfortunately many computer scientists and other people divide computer science into theoretical and applied computer science leav ing no place for basic experimental work this report describes basic experimental work in several domains of computer science 1 introduction some computer scientists and some computer engineers mistakenly identify basic research with theory and applied research with experiment a recent report by the national research council academic careers for experi mental computer scientists and engineers1 cou95 was particularly bad about this all the experimental work mentioned was explicitly applied ie in support of specific applied projects this may have something to do 1http www nap edu nap online acesc 1 page 2 1 introduction 2 with the persistent tendency of that body to deny any distinction between science and engineering in computing however computer science also has an important basic research experi mental component and our object is to describe some of this work enough to show the important role experiment plays in basic computer science research at present this is only an outline here are some topics search richard korf korf cs ucla edu will write a section on this game playing turing proposed a chess program in the 1940s and recently deep blue had a match with the world champion the experimental chess programs have taught a lot about heuristics and what computa tional abilities are required to match human performance the failure to make good go programs illustrates that we still don t understand how to make a program that breaks a situation up into components that can be analyzed separately at first following this by an analysis of their interaction jonathan schaeffer of the university of alberta jonathan cs ualberta ca has written about the role of experiment in game playing there are html2 and postscript3 versions automatic theorem proving again the experimental work has shown us the strengths and weaknesses of various theoretical ideas alan bundy bundy edinburgh ac uk has already finished a draft it is experi mental work in atp4 planning most of the research in planning under uncertainty has a strong experimental component subbarao kambhampati rao asu edu has agreed to write about this experiments with np complete problems problems that are np complete in general are often much easier in the average case this has been ex plored experimentally and a phase change phenomenon between cases with many solutions and cases with no solutions has turned up this seems to be analogous to phase changes in physics 2http www cs ualberta ca jonathan papers expcs html 3http www cs ualberta ca jonathan papers expcs ps 4http www dai ed ac uk staff personal pages bundy mccarthy ps page 3 references 3 bart selman selman research att com will write about experimental study of np completeness in ai including phase transitions search and reasoning andrew goldberg avg research nj nec com has written about exper imental algorithms we have html5 and ps6 versions actually goldberg and selman will divide up their topics in a way they will shortly specify more precisely natural language fernando pereira pereira research att com will write about experimental research in natural language vision tom binford binford cs stanford edu will write about vision neural nets jordan pollack pollack cs brandeis edu will write about neu ral nets and evolutionary programming connectionism geoffrey hinton hinton cs toronto edu will write about connectionism hinton dropped out for lack of time so we need some one to write about connectionism machine learning tom dietterich tgd cs orst edu has written about experimental research in machine learning we have html7 and gzipped postscript8 versions references cou95 national research council academic careers for experimental com puter scientists and engineers 1995 steam stanford edu u ftp jmc experimental tex begun 1996 may 23 latexed 1997 jun 24 at 5 46 pm 5http www neci nj nec com homepages avg jmc alg perf html 6http www neci nj nec com homepages avg jmc alg perf ps 7http www cs orst edu tgd experimental research index html 8ftp ftp cs orst edu pub tgd papers experimental research ps gz
