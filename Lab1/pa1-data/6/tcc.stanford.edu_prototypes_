tcc tcc prototypes tcc people project prototypes software publications more info tcc prototypes there are currently two prototypes for the tcc architecture atlas pluto atlas atlas is the first implementation of the tcc architecture it uses powerpc 405 processors with a modified data cache that implements version management and conflict detection for transactional execution the current design is mapped on a single bee 2 board which allows for up to 8 processors a 9th processor runs linux and handles system calls and exceptions for the whole system the design operates at 100mhz and is approximately 100 times faster than our simulation system it also includes extensive support for debugging and performance tuning atlas is also known as ramp red and is one of the designs in the ramp initiative processor powerpc 405 hardcore processor count 8 1 data cache 32kb 4 way set associative 32 kbytes tm support tcc protocol in data cache ocm bram for register checkpoint interconnect star topology memory 512mb ddr2 frequency 100mhz software montavista linux 3.1 tcc api designers njuguna njoroge sewook wee jared a casper christos kozyrakis kunle olukotun references atlas a chip multiprocessor with transactional memory support njuguna njoroge jared casper sewook wee yuriy teslyar daxia ge christos kozyrakis kunle olukotun proceedings of the conference on design automation and test in europe date nice france april 2007 paper pdf talk pdf bibtex a practical fpga based framework for novel cmp research sewook wee jared casper njuguna njoroge yuriy teslyar daxia ge christos kozyrakis and kunle olukotun acm 2007 this is the author's version of the work it is posted here by permission of acm for your personal use not for redistribution the definitive version was published in the proceedings of the fifteenth acm sigda international symposium on field programmable gate arrays monterey california 18 20 february 2007 http doi acm org 10.1145 1216919.1216936 paper pdf talk pdf bibtex building and using the atlas transactional memory system njuguna njoroge sewook wee jared casper justin burdick yuriy teslyar christos kozyrakis kunle olukotun workshop on architecture research using fpga platforms 12th international symposium on high performance computer architecture hpca austin texas usa 12 february 2006 paper pdf talk pdf bibtex pluto pluto is a tcc prototype based on the m32r embedded architecture m32r is designed by renesas technology which is fully synthesizable core coded by verilog hdl and can be programmed to fpga directly it provides an efficient platform for supporting architecture development pluto uses 2 m32r processors each with a modified data caches that implements version management and conflict detection for transactional execution the two symmetric cpu cores are connected via an internal on chip bus the bus arbiter supports tcc protocol such as commit phaseid controller the new architecture has exception interrupt for handling tcc overflow and violation processor m32r softmacro core processor count 2 data cache 8kb 2 way set associative 16 bytes line internal memory 1mb built in sram can be replaced with l2 tm support tcc protocol in data cache interconnect bus based shared memory memory 64mb sdram on board frequency 20mhz software tcc api debian gnu linux kernel 2.6 under porting designers sugako otani slides pluto presentation 23 april 2007 contact
