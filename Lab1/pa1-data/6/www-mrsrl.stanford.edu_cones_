3d cones trajectory design read the mrm paper design and analysis of a practical 3d cones trajectory note a new improved version of the algorithm has been implemented untar this file to get the latest version note that some of the interfaces have changed here are the files you need to generate 3d cones trajectories findcone m generates a 3d cone given the desired resolution fov waveform length and range of polar angles gencone m generates a 3d cone given the desired resolution fov number of interleaves and range of polar angles wc c the mex file which implements the core algorithm compile with mex wc c mrewind m a support function which calculates rewinders thanks to brian hargreaves intlineellipse m a support function which calculates the intersection of a line and an ellipse please e mail ptgurney at mrsrl dot stanford dot edu if you have any questions a brief note to say that you re using these functions would also be greatly appreciated so that i can let you know if any bugs errors are found fixed thanks notes errata there is a step missing in section designing waveforms for a range of polar angles of the paper in addition to passing in the substituted resrange and thetarange values gtwist must be scaled by sqrt 1 sin thetalower 2 sin thetaupper 2 tan thetarange 2 sqrt 1 tan thetarange 2 the above matlab functions are correct questions please email me updated july 1 2007
