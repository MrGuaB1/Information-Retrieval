on the form factor between two polygons on the form factor between two polygons peter schroder and pat hanrahan proceedings of siggraph 1993 abstract form factors are used in radiosity to describe the fraction of diffusely reflected light leaving one surface and arriving at another they are a fundamental geometric property used for computation many special configurations admit closed form solutions however the important case of the form factor between two polygons in three space has had no known closed form solution we give such a solution for the case of general planar convex or concave possibly containing holes polygons additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper 270k compressed mathematica source code c library implementation back up to papers index
