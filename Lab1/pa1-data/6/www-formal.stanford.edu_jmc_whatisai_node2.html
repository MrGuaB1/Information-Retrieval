branches of ai next up previous next applications of ai up what is artificial intelligence previous basic questions branches of ai q what are the branches of ai a here's a list but some branches are surely missing because no one has identified them yet some of these may be regarded as concepts or topics rather than full branches logical ai what a program knows about the world in general the facts of the specific situation in which it must act and its goals are all represented by sentences of some mathematical logical language the program decides what to do by inferring that certain actions are appropriate for achieving its goals the first article proposing this was mcc59 mcc89 is a more recent summary mcc96b lists some of the concepts involved in logical ai sha97 is an important text search ai programs often examine large numbers of possibilities eg moves in a chess game or inferences by a theorem proving program discoveries are continually made about how to do this more efficiently in various domains pattern recognition when a program makes observations of some kind it is often programmed to compare what it sees with a pattern for example a vision program may try to match a pattern of eyes and a nose in a scene in order to find a face more complex patterns eg in a natural language text in a chess position or in the history of some event are also studied these more complex patterns require quite different methods than do the simple patterns that have been studied the most representation facts about the world have to be represented in some way usually languages of mathematical logic are used inference from some facts others can be inferred mathematical logical deduction is adequate for some purposes but new methods of non monotonic inference have been added to logic since the 1970s the simplest kind of non monotonic reasoning is default reasoning in which a conclusion is to be inferred by default but the conclusion can be withdrawn if there is evidence to the contrary for example when we hear of a bird we man infer that it can fly but this conclusion can be reversed when we hear that it is a penguin it is the possibility that a conclusion may have to be withdrawn that constitutes the non monotonic character of the reasoning ordinary logical reasoning is monotonic in that the set of conclusions that can the drawn from a set of premises is a monotonic increasing function of the premises circumscription is another form of non monotonic reasoning common sense knowledge and reasoning this is the area in which ai is farthest from human level in spite of the fact that it has been an active research area since the 1950s while there has been considerable progress eg in developing systems of non monotonic reasoning and theories of action yet more new ideas are needed the cyc system contains a large but spotty collection of common sense facts learning from experience programs do that the approaches to ai based on connectionism and neural nets specialize in that there is also learning of laws expressed in logic mit97 is a comprehensive undergraduate text on machine learning programs can only learn what facts or behaviors their formalisms can represent and unfortunately learning systems are almost all based on very limited abilities to represent information planning planning programs start with general facts about the world especially facts about the effects of actions facts about the particular situation and a statement of a goal from these they generate a strategy for achieving the goal in the most common cases the strategy is just a sequence of actions epistemology this is a study of the kinds of knowledge that are required for solving problems in the world ontology ontology is the study of the kinds of things that exist in ai the programs and sentences deal with various kinds of objects and we study what these kinds are and what their basic properties are emphasis on ontology begins in the 1990s heuristics a heuristic is a way of trying to discover something or an idea imbedded in a program the term is used variously in ai heuristic functions are used in some approaches to search to measure how far a node in a search tree seems to be from a goal heuristic predicates that compare two nodes in a search tree to see if one is better than the other ie constitutes an advance toward the goal may be more useful my opinion genetic programming genetic programming is a technique for getting programs to solve a task by mating random lisp programs and selecting fittest in millions of generations it is being developed by john koza's group and here's a tutorial next up previous next applications of ai up what is artificial intelligence previous basic questions john mccarthy 2007 11 12
