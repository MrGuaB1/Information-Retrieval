thermodynamics domain theory sharable compositional models this is an introductory guided tour to a new compositional modeling language cml being designed collaboratively by leading qualitative physics research groups cml is a general declarative modeling language for specifying the symbolic and mathematical properties of the structure and behavior of physical systems the language is intended to facilitate the construction and accumulation of sharable models of core engineering domains and is a candidate common language for transmiting models to and from network engineering services see the cml specification for a detailed description the developers of cml are brian falkenhainer and dan bobrow xerox corporation adam farquhar richard fikes tom gruber and yumi iwasaki knowledge systems laboratory stanford university ken forbus northwestern university and ben kuipers university of texas at austin here are the main topics covered in the tour cml overview thermodynamics domain theory thermodynamics ontologies contents of the domain theory model fragment definition conclusion start tour back to htw demonstrations
