reprinted from the american mathematical monthly vol lx no 10 december 1953 an everywhere continuous nowhere diffrentiable page 1 reprinted from the american mathematical monthly vol lx no 10 december 1953 an everywhere continuous nowhere diffrentiable function john mccarthy princeton university the following is an especially simple example it is f x n 1 2 ng 22n x where g x 1 x for 2 x 0 g x 1 x for 0 x 2 and g x has period 4 the function f x is continuous because it is the uniform limit of con tinuous functions to show that it is not differentiable take x 2 2 k choosing whichever sign makes x and x x be on the same linear segment of g 22k x we have 1 g 22n x 0 for n k since g 22n x has period 4 2 2 n 2 g 22k x 1 3 k 1 n 1 g 22n x k 1 max g 22n x k 1 22k 1 2 2k 2k2 2k 1 hence f x 2 k22k 2k22k 1 which goes to infinity with k the proof that the present example has the required property is simpler than that for any other example the author has seen weierstrass gave the example f x n 0 bn cos anx for b 1 and ab 1 3 2 which is discussed in goursat hedrick mathematical analysis a complete discussion of functions with various singular properties is given in hobson functions of a real variable volume ii cambridge 1926 1 page 2 2006 january note i was tempted to dig up this 1953 note of mine and put it on my web page by reading the calculus gallery by william dunham this excellent book includes the first proofs of a number of important theorems including weierstrass's proof that his function has the required properties dunham's version of weierstrass's proof is six pages of what dunham de scribes as difficult mathematics since my proof is 13 lines of what i consider easy math i decided to copy my old note and discuss it dunham recounts that the famous mathematicians hermite poincare and picard all expressed themselves as repelled by weierstrass's pathological example i m sure that by the time i was born in 1927 such functions were no longer regarded as repellent my own opinion is that most everywhere continuous functions in some suitable sense of most are nowhere differentiable remarks 1 to prove a function f differentiable at x one must show that no matter how x goes to zero f x x x approaches a limit to prove f non differentiable at x one need only find a sequence of values of x for which the limit doesn t exist 2 if f x is to be represented as the sum of a series of continuous func tions it suffices to bound the terms by a suitable positive terms 2 k in our case then f is sure to be everywhere continuous it doesn t matter how fast the successive terms wiggle 3 in our case the terms are 2 kg 22k x the 22k x grows fast enough to overcome the 2 k damping 4 i would expect i 1 x to be nowhere differentiable for most any initial g x 5 however the particular g x makes the proof easy because the peri odicity kills the higher terms of the series for g x and using 22k x for the argument allows the kth term to go to infinity and dominate the earlier terms of the series it seems lucky in whatever sense luck exists in mathematics 2
