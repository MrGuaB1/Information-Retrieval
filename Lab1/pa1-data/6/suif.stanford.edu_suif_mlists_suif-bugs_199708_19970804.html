from christopher lukas lukas cs wisc edu date mon 04 aug 1997 11 49 39 0500 subject overflow in const bug message id 199708041649 laa10477 havarti cs wisc edu i don t really know whether this is a bug or a feature this thing can be seen in 134 perl the problem is that gcc and suif have a different method of treating overflowing constants the example i extracted from perl is printf d n char 0234 sun cc & gcc say char 0234 100 suif says char 0234 28 suif is doing this in fit_immed in eval cc i don t actually know if there is a specification for how to handle casts like this but perhaps it should be what the other compilers do chris lukas
