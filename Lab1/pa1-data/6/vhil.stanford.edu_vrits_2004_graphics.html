vrits 2004 home participants vr worlds apply social science computer science digital graphics contact us students learned how to us 3dstudiomax to create low polygon 3d objects animate skeletons to create avatars that interact with subjects in the virtual scene create environments and architecture for the virtual world here is an example of an avatar loaded in vizard his wardrobe was custom made and used as a skin over the wireframe using this method allows avatars to wear different outfits this method of layering can also be used to load different movements and animations into one avatar avatars are animated using characterstudio for 3dstudiomax v 5 the skeleton was provided by the creators of vizard it was on a max file this allows us to animate the avatars the file is then exported as a caf file and loaded into the resources male folder under vizard a plugin from cal3d was used to change the max file into a caf file this is a face faces are created using the software 3d me now from a composite of front and profile views of a person's head these heads once loaded into a program called people maker and turned into a vrml file can be animated an acccurate talking blinking 3d representation can then be attached to an avatar body for use in experiments environments are built in 3d stuio max we start with simple geometric shapes and usually keep it that way to reduce the number of polygons loaded into the world colors are added to the wireframe which make them now look like 3d shapes with volume and weight textures are attached like skins that will give the world a higher degree of realism
