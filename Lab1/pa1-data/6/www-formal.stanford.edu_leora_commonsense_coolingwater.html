common sense challenge problem cooling water to room temperature from the common sense problem page physical reasoning a failure of common sense cooling water to room temperature in connection with ernie davis's absolute zero problem here's an experiment with a very counter intuitive outcome the apparatus is two containers with one fitting loosely into the other hot water is placed into the inner one and iced water into the outer one forming a cooling jacket the experiment measures how long it takes for the water in the inner container to cool to room temperature if the initial temperature of the hot inner water is very high it cools to room temperature in less time than if its initial temperature is lower why is this surprising more difficult and maybe outside common sense what explanation could be given for it contributed by pat hayes phayes ai uwf edu institute for the interdisciplinary study of human and machine cognition university of west florida usa 19th september 1997 return to the common sense problem page
