research_nw home people research publications links photos internal nathan witthoft postdoctoral fellow i am broadly interested in studying the relationship between memory and perception using methods from behavioral psychology neuroscience and a lot of talking to myself and others this question has many loose ends and it is hard for me to pick just one maybe i think if i pull all the ends at once the knot will come undone one approach is to try to understand if and how the past influences current visual experience some of the things i have done in this line in collaboraton with many others are work on face adaptation the role of language in color perception top down perceptual reorganization in kids unsupervised learning of novel shape dimensions and the role of learning in synesthesia a second strand i like to think about is if and to what degree our thoughts and memories make use of or are instantiated by perceptual mechanisms the work on synesthesia is most directly relevant to this question as i think it speaks to the nature of mental imagery and why we judge some mental experiences to be more perceptual than others finally there is the question of recognition how is it that we connect some visual experience to a name the main work i am doing in this area is studying congenital prosopagnosia though questions of recognition are importantt in many of the other experiments i have worked on using behavior and neuroimaging free page hit counter
