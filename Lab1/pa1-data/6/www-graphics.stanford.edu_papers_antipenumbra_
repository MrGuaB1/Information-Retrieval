computing the antipenumbra of an area light source computing the antipenumbra of an area light source seth teller proceedings of siggraph 1992 abstract we define the antiumbra and the antipenumbra of a convex area light source shining through a sequence of convex areal holes in three dimensions the antiumbra is the volume from which all points on the light source can be seen the antipenumbra is the volume from which some but not all of the light source can be seen we show that the antipenumbra is in general a disconnected set bounded by portions of quadric surfaces and describe an implemented o n 2 time algorithm that computes this boundary where n is the total number of edges comprising the light source and holes the antipenumbra computation is motivated by a visibility scheme in which we wish to determine the volume visible to an observer looking through a sequence of transparent convex holes or portals connecting adjacent cells in a spatial subdivision knowledge of the antipenumbra should also prove useful for rendering shadowed objects finally we have extended the algorithm to compute the planar and quadratic surfaces along which the rate of areal variation in the visible portion of the light source changes discontinuously due to occlusion these surfaces are relevant in polygon meshing schemes for global illumination and shadow computations additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper 150 k back up to papers index
