dissertation browser information stanford dissertation browser project information topic models by daniel ramage visualization by jason chuang through the stanford mimir project nlp group and visualization group click to launch an experiment in document exploration the stanford dissertation browser is an experimental interface for document collections that enables richer interaction than search stanford's phd dissertation abstracts from 1993 2008 are presented through the lens of a text model that distills high level similarity and word usage patterns in the data you ll see each stanford department as a circle colored by school and sized by the number of phd students graduating from that department when you click a department it becomes the focus of the browser and every other department moves to show its relative similarity to the centered department the similarity scores are computed using a supervised mixture model based on labeled lda every dissertation is taken as a weighted mixture of a unigram language model associated with every stanford department this lets us infer that say dissertation x is 60 computer science 20 physics and so on these scores are averaged within a department to compute department level statistics the similarities shown and need not be symmetric for instance economics dissertations at stanford use more words from political science than vice versa essentially the visualization shows word overlap between departments measured by letting the dissertations in one department borrow words from another department which departments borrow the most words from which others the statistics are computed for each year in the data when you zoom in two levels click on a department twice individual dissertations are plotted on a line between each dissertation's home department and its next highest scoring department in proportion to how much that dissertation uses words from each of those two departments the relative position of two dissertations is only meaningful when they are on the same radial line dissertations from other departments that have a high score for the central focused department are also shown colored for instance take a look at computer science in 2005 you ll see three dissertations along the radial line to linguistics those are the three students that graduated from the stanford nlp group that year there are plenty of other places you find similar things that work and a few places that don t in particular small departments have less data and so are more susceptible to noise our experience building this browser emphasized the ways that good interactive visualizations can improve text modeling and vice versa for instance the visualization allowed us to experiment with many model variations lda tf idf etc to see how well each matched our intuitions and the contours of the models informed our choices in presentation the model and visualization shown are our best so far but both leave plenty of room for improvement the browser is build using flare visualization library for flash adobe flash player is required to view the browser launch the stanford dissertation browser
