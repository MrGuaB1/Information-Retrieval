global income trajectories figure global income trajectories under bau and in the case of stabilizing the atmosphere at 350 ppm 450 and 550 ppm observe that we have assumed rather pessimistic estimates of the cost of atmospheric stabilization average costs to the economy assumed here are $200 tc for 550ppm target $300 tc for 450ppm and $400 tc for 350ppm and that the environmental benefits in terms of climate change and reduction of local air pollution of meeting various stabilization targets have not been included source azar & schneider 2002
