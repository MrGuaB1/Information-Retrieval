ssfp catalyzation design tools ssfp catalyzation design tools brian hargreaves introduction this site contains matlab files that can be used to design catalyzation sequences for ssfp true fisp fiesta balanced ffe catalyzation sequences are useful for manipulating magnetization into and out of the steady state simple sequences 1 2 do this job quite well but it is sometimes desireable to have accurate manipulation across a broad spectral band the most accurate method we have found so far is to use shinnar le roux slr pulse design 3 to design spectrally selective catalyzing sequences the matlab functions here should allow such design without too much coding effort the design method was described previously in 4 downloads and getting started you can download the entire set of matlab functions that you will need these are all m files and have been tested on matlab 6.0 they should work on matlab 5.0 but will not work on previous verisons of matlab 1 right click on one of the links to download the m files ssfptools tar file 2a on unix or linux make a directory called ssfptools and copy the file to this directory and then run tar xzvf ssfptools tar gz alternatively you can run gunzip ssfptools tar gz and then tar xvf ssfptools tar gz 2b on windows use winzip or another utility to extract the files make a folder called ssfptools and extract them to this folder 3 run matlab from the ssfptools directory run help ssfptools to see a list of design and analysis functions run tutorial1 for a tutorial about ssfp catalyzation links coming soon references deimling m and heid o proceedings of the 2nd smr san francisco p 495 1994 scheffler k et al mag reson med 45 6 p 1075 june 2001 pauly j et al ieee trans med imag 10 p 53 march 1991 hargreaves b et al mag reson med 46 1 p 149 july 2001 this page is maintained by brian hargreaves your comments questions and suggestions are welcome via email via brian hargreaves website
