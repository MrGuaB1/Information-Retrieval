windows 95 networking faq windows 95 networking faq if like most people you don t care about the history or future of the faq then just read it or jump to the most popular section tcp ip internet issues i started building this faq nearly two years ago because i knew very little about windows networking and believed that creating a forum for qualified people to discuss problems would be the best way to learn about supporting an operating system that was heading towards stanford like a load of bricks it worked people actually started to refer to me as a leading expert in win95 networking which was good for a laugh especially since there was some truth to it that's all i expected to gain from the exercise and that's all i got now it's over as of this writing i have hardly touched the faq for over a year and i have been actively recruiting people to take over maintenance for 19 months no one has done so i guess they realize there's no profit in it this faq is shareware share it with whoever might benefit from it share anything else you might have with the world if you think it's something worth maintaining at the very least the dozens of broken links should be fixed then do it i hate to see it die but i m done with it i ve got bigger fish to fry if you want to contribute something then i d suggest finding john ball who i believe owes us some money or reading about padgett's nightmare and always do the right thing rich
