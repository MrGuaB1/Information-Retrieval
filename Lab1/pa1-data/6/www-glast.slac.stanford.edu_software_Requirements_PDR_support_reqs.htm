pdr support requirements pdr support requirements for pdr we must present the basic performance parameters of the instrument and show they meet the relevant lat performance specifications in particular we must plot after all background rejection and resolution cuts the psf as a function of energy and angle for front and back sections of the tkr the energy resolution on axis and at 60 degrees incidence angle as a function of energy the effective area as a function of energy and angle and hence the fov the residual background as a fraction of the accepted high latitude diffuse flux as a function of energy the following elements must be in place to begin this evaluation process updated validated and documented geometry to match the current design along with configuration control of the design parameters updated source classes incorporating the improved understanding of the background fluxes a documented release of the simulation and reconstruction in the new framework including the new event storage format a version of the event display that is compatible with the new simulation reconstruction and event storage format machinery in place to generate the necessary statistics of signal and background events we specify a requirement of 10 million background events with a goal of 100 million background events generated and analyzed the machinery must include a simple mechanism to identify each event uniquely and the capability to produce from an event list files with a subset of the full event sample an updated version of merit or an equivalent tool to run in the new environment ideally this tool could run both on the stored events and on a new standard tuple depending on the size of the full events a standard tuple may be a practical necessity a basic analysis framework to operate on the new event stores last modified 02 18 2001 13 04
