rhean westerlund rhean westerlund nov 30 2011 arts and activism art has long been used as a means for making social commentary accessible to a wider audience for one there are numerous forms from which to choose for me it was the graphic novel the graphic novel is an art form with the narrative arc of a novel and the sequential illustrations of a comic the images and text work in tandem to tell a story the words articulate only what is necessary and the proverbial pictures worth a thousand words cut straight to the reader's viewer's core i discovered the form through a creative writing course i took at stanford seventeen other students and i undertook a collaborative project to write illustrate and lay out our own graphic novel we decided it was the perfect vehicle for social commentary we each proposed a book topic i was inspired by a bbc article i read about virunga national park in the democratic republic of the congo in africa the eastern region of the drc where virunga is located is the site of the world's deadliest conflict since wwii the article focused on the park rangers who risk their lives to protect the wildlife there including a huge population of endangered mountain gorillas at the time the article was written several gorillas had just been shot dead i read it and i cried not just because the situation was sad but because hardly anyone knew or talked about it and that was tragic the lack of awareness seemed to demean the significance of the rangers struggles i had an overwhelming desire to tell people about it thinking that maybe if they just knew what was going on they d start to care and if they cared they might do something to help my classmates agreed it was the right topic for our book and we began the long process of creating a graphic novel as we researched we realized we had put ourselves in an interesting predicament the real story was is still ongoing we didn t know how to story was going to end in real life let alone in our version even though ours was fiction and the more we read about virunga the more issues we uncovered poaching illegal coal trade rebel militia child soldiers and rampant sexual violence as our knowledge grew so did our book until it threatened to become unwieldy it was our story's protagonist eleven year old malika who finally led us to our conclusion malika is an artist herself ever captivated by her surroundings and the animals that live there with her artist's eyes she finds beauty amidst ugliness and wonder in what others are too quick to destroy in the end we decided to offer not just revelation but comfort an alternative possibility a picture of what could be if only the effort were made to achieve it
