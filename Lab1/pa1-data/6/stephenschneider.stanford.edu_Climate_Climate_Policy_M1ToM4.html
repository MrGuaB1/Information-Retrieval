m1 to m4 figure schematic depiction of the relationship between well calibrated scenarios the wider range of judged uncertainty that might be elicited through decision analytic techniques and the full range of uncertainty which is wider to represent overconfidence in human judgments m1 to m4 represent scenarios produced by four models eg globally averaged temperature increases from an equilibrium response to doubled co 2 concentrations this lies within a full range of uncertainty that is not fully identified much less directly quantified by existing theoretical or empirical evidence modified from jones 2000 figure 2.2 in schneider and kuntz duriseti 2002
