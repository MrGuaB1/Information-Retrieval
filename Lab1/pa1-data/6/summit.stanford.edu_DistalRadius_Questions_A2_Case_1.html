question_2 case 1 answer 2 page 4 of 28 2 the distal radius growth plate contributes approximately a 55 growth of the radius and 31 total upper extremity growth b 65 growth of the radius and 31 total upper extremity growth c 75 growth of the radius and 29 total upper extremity growth d 75 growth of the radius and 39 total upper extremity growth e 85 growth of the radius and 39 total upper extremity growth answer d 75 growth of the radius and 39 total upper extremity the distal radius and distal ulna growth plates contribute significantly more than the proximal ends to radial and ulnar total length and approximately 40 of the total upper extremity length in contrast the proximal humerus contributes the most growth to the humerus and also contributes 40 growth rates vary with age the more active growth plate for example the distal radius compared with the proximal radius assumes all remaining growth in the last two years prior to growth plate closure remaining growth and contribution of growth charts are useful in planning surgery around open physes both charts j pritchett for more charts see the growing child in developmental anatomy
