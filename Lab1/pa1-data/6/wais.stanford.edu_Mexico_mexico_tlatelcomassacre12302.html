mexico the tlatelco massacre back to index mexico the tlatelco massacre from mexico raul escalante writes can you please clarify what you mean by so called in your reference to the tlatelolco massacre i can t imagine you using the qualifier lightly so i am curious as to what there is to doubt my father was involved in the rather naive demonstrations leading up to october 2nd and only missed being at tlatelolco because of another engagement good friends of his were there and were incarcerated as you surely know it is a matter close to the hearts of most young mexicans even those of us who don t subscribe to demagoguery it is ironic especially for the mexican left that much of the reliable information we have on tlatelolco and the guerra sucia comes from us archives and was originally collected by cia operatives i may be mistaken of course my apogetic explanation so called does not mean that it did not take place it simply means that this is the way it is commonly known for those who did not know mexico city we should explain that tlatlolco is a district the focal point of which is the so called square of the three cultures because if features a pre colombian structure a colonial church and a modern building the foreign office i would be grateful if raul would keep us informed about the progress of the investigation into the massacre the massacre took place during the presidency of guillermo diaz ordaz but the dirty war extended over a period of time the government claimed rightly i believe that the demonstration which led to the massacre was planned to disrupt mexico city during the olympic games taking place there going back to our analysis of steps leading up to unrest and violence part of the trick is to time demonstrations right this does not justify the demonstration or the massacre ronald hilton 1 23 02 webmaster
