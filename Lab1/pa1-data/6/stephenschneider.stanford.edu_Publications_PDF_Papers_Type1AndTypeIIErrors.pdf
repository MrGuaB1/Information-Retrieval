therefore even though the scientific community expresses consi page 1 from class notes of steve schneider therefore even though the scientific community expresses considerable confidence for frequently observed events the community is particularly reluctant to ascribe levels of confidence to singular events like collapse of the conveyor belt thermohaline circulation thc of the north atlantic ocean or the west antarctic ice sheet so it is not surprising that the scientists have struggled with ways to both alert the public to these possibilities and at the same time not appearing overconfident in projecting outcomes that cannot be directly validated by the data available now or in the foreseeable future table 2 type 1 versus type 2 errors and their consequences decision forecast proves false forecast proves true accept forecast policy response follows type i error correct decision reject or ignore forecast no policy response correct decision type ii error it is common in policy analysis to refer to an incorrect forecast that was taken to be true as a type 1 error and a decision to ignore an uncertain forecast that turns out to be true as a type 2 error the prime paradigm within the scientific community is to view the type 1 error as the more egregious mistake whereas within the policy arena the type 2 error is often more concerning decision makers often prefer to hedge against a potentially damaging event rather than wait for it to possibly happen clearly there is a trade off between the types of errors reducing the type of one error compromises the other the dilemma that this trade off implies has plagued ipcc and will continue to do so as a result of the difference in cultural norms competing paradigms essentially between science and policy communities therefore translating the conclusions of scientists framed in carefully hedged language appropriate to type 1 error culture into credible language interpretable by the decision making community is an ongoing challenge
