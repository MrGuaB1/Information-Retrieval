getting and installing cmt getting and installing cmt the manual for cmt and several tutorials are available at the cmt home page a short explanation of the concepts of cmt was prepared for glast developers you are discouraged to import the executable from the cmt web site if you do so anyhow install also the source code obtaining the code slac unix users at slac unix the environment variables cmtroot and cmtbin are defined in the group cshrc they select the version and system respectively unix users who work at slac or via afs can use cmt which is installed at cmtroot cmtbin cmt installing cmt on your local machine for developers who need their own copy the checkout and build procedures on unix and windows are described below the source code is the same for unix and windows machines cmt is available in the central glast cvs repository this is the version that all glast developers should use make sure that you select the correct version at present v1r12p20020606 the commands to checkout the cmt sources and scripts are for windows the instructions have to be run from the command line eg the dos prompt mkdir cmt cd cmt cvs co d version r version cmt on windows vcmt can be used for checkout fill in the version in the cmt setup box then click checkout but the very first checkout of cmt has to be done with cvs because vcmt will not start up without having a version of cmt available building cmt windows you can either build cmt directly or use the vcmt gui we recommend the use of vcmt once you have vcmt installed on your setup vcmt makes the setup of the environment and the use of cmt quite easy using microsoft visual c++ to build cmt open the cmt version visual cmt dsw workspace in microsoft visual c++ select the cmt project as the active project and if you can switch from debug to release select build from the build menu this will compile and link the cmt executable into the cmt version visualc directory using vcmt to build cmt fill in the version number click the build cmt button this will compile and link the cmt executable into the cmt version visualc directory add the directory containing cmt to your path open the windows control panel choose system click the advanced tab click the environment variables button edit the path variable under user variables and add the directory cmt version visualc verification from a dos windows execute the command cmt the result should be the help instructions of cmt unix note these instructions are only needed for those users who do not want to use the central slac installation of cmt ie for users who want their own copy these instructions are only for users who do not use the central slac installation of cmt check out cmt from the repository as described above move into the mgr directory of the cmt package cd mgr issue the following commands from the mgr subdirectory chmod x a setenv cmtconfig sh cmt_system sh b use backslash install c source setup csh d gmake e install f notes a is only necessary if the execute bit is not set some scripts do not get checked out as executable b saves the name for your current platform in the environment variable cmtconfig eg i386_linux24 c builds the setup csh script do not omit the d sets up environment variables for running cmt e builds the cmt executable f does the installation don t forget the set the cmt environment variables at slac most of the cmt environment variables are set by the script glastroot ground scripts group cshrc at this stage you need to set up for your local installation only the path cmtroot cmtbin to the cmt executable cmtbin has the value linux see also the setup described in developing the code unix verify the environment variables by issuing the commands cmt gives the help of cmt env grep cmt last modified january 21 2003 back to main menu previous step next step windows unix
