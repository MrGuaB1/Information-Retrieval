19 jan 2004 weekly report glast calorimeter software weekly report week of 29 march 2004 nrl sasha last week i was working on getting gain calibration table for gsi data i found that we have never done muon calibration with gsi gain settings lexgain 7 leygain 6 hexgain 15 heygain 14 as well as charge injection calibration with gsi gains and muon fle dac setting so last week byron made necessary calibrations and i produces muon peaks and nonlinearity correction functions for gsi gains and muon data collection i am still finishing the final gain table andrey produced a prototype for the note on the failure modes study we discussed this draft paper with eric and he approved it still i need to get more data on 50 gev photons the simulations are running now hopefully sometime next week or may be a little later these will be finished once they will be done i wil put things together and make a report mark working on cal support for i&t document modifying and updating cal s w task list in preparation for meeting next week attempting to install gr using vc 7.1 not much success yet llr pol will be at nrl starting next monday to work on calibration with sasha berrie no report bordeaux thierry benoit benoit has incorporated sasha's non linearity correction into the gsi data analysis the quenching results for the em now come out very similar to those obtained for the minical thierry and benoit have worked on incorporating their heavy ion reaction model that works on standalone geant4 v6 0 into glastrelease although the problem with the treatment of secondaries in version 5.2 remains a problem with the treatment of the ion's mass in geant4 embedded in glastrelease has been uncovered possibly due to a confusion between mev and gev units the two problems secondaries in standalone 5.2 and wrong mass assignment in glastrelease may be related gam no report slac xin no report
