glast calorimeter calorimeter the calorimeter design for glast produces flashes of light that are used to determine how much energy is in each gamma ray a calorimeter calorie meter is a device that measures the energy heat calor of a particle when it is totally absorbed csi tl bars arranged in a segmented manner give both longitudinal and transverse information about the energy deposition pattern once a gamma ray penetrates through the anticoincidence shield the silicon strip tracker and tungsten converter planes it then passes into the cesium iodide calorimeters this causes a scintillation reaction in the cesium iodide and the resultant light flash is photoelectrically converted to a voltage this voltage is then digitized recorded and relayed to earth by the spacecraft's onboard computer and telemetry antenna cesium iodide blocks are arranged in two perpendicular directions to provide additional positional information about the shower home
