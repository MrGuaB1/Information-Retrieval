slac's 40th anniversary celebration more comments and congratulations the following excerpts are from congratulatory letters sent to slac director jonathan dorfan over the years slac has been a center of pioneering physics and innovative technology and this is a time to celebrate its many outstanding achievements achievements that helped shape our modern view of particle physics special recognition and congratulations should not only be given to slac physicists but also to the many talented and dedicated people who have worked in the lab and made these achievements possible slac's recent definitive measurement of cp violation in the b system extends its great legacy so on this special occasion i wish slac a very happy birthday celebration and many years of continued achievement i am sure that there are many great things yet to come jerome friedman nobel laureate in this occasion i want to formulate strong withes for the bright development of the future scientific and technical programmes at slac in my view your laboratory gathers a set of people with such exceptional intellectual and human qualities that it will more than ever remain a place of excellence in our field of research bernard d almagne director centre scientifique d orsay france on this great occasion i would like to congratulate you on the great contributions made by slac to the development of high energy physics research over the past years and i wish even greater contributions will be made in the future the cooperation between slac and ihep started some 20 years ago it has been very smooth with the careful nurture of us both on this great occasion i would like to especially mention prof panofsky prof richter prof loew and of course you yourself for the great efforts you have made for this cooperation i wish this cooperation between us can continue as smoothly as before chen hesheng director of ihep institute of high energy physics china i send the heartiest congratulations from the staff at cclrc who have over many years enjoyed their visits and collaborations with slac scientists and engineers press on to the half century professor jv wood chief executive council for the central laboratory of the research councils united kingdom the outstanding success of slac and he key role its people and their discoveries have played in the history of particle physics is truly remarkable this is the best illustrated by the impressive number of nobel prizes awarded to persons doing their research with the slac facilities the beautiful performance of the b factory is another feather on your hat and it is yielding after very short time already very important results this facility will certainly continue to provide very important measurements spear iii and lcls two major facilities for synchrotron radiation are being built which will provide major progress in many other fields of science three years ago desy celebrated its 40th birthday today it is your turn the two laboratories have developed over the years in a very similar way combining particle physics accelerator physics and science with x rays and exploiting their synergies it is therefore nice to see that the collaboration between slac and desy is being more and more intensified in x ray science as well as in linear colliders it is my belief that we can only tackle the challenges of the future together in this spirit i wish you your laboratory and your colleagues a very happy celebration and a strong future albrecht wagner chairman of the board of directors desy hamburg i certainly wish you a very successful celebration even though slac is only half my age you have many achievements about which to be proud and just think when slac is 80 i ll be 160 leon lederman fermilab nobel laureate i first visited stanford linear accelerator in december 1957 i watched pief operating a crane and met many other great physicists including feynman who commented on the monopoly game i was playing and finally lost on the floor of pief's house next time i was allowed to come to the usa and stanford in 1898 in 1997 sid invited me in order to save my life my gratitude to slac has no limits i wish further great achievements to slac and to all my slac colleagues lev okun famed russian academian head of the theoretical physics laboratory at moscow's institute for theoretical and experimental physics
