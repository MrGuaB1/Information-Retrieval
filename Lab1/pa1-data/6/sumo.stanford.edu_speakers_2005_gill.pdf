efficient generation of fair bits john gill electrical engineering department stanford university von neumann in 1951 described page 1 efficient generation of fair bits john gill electrical engineering department stanford university von neumann in 1951 described a simple procedure for producing independent equiprob able fair bits given a source of independent but biased bits von neumann's procedure mapped pairs of input bits to strings of input bits 01 0 10 1 00 11  empty string the output bits are equiprobable because p 01 p 10 pq where p p 1 they are independent because they are functions of different independent inputs von neumann's procedure is inefficient it produces on average pq output bits per input for example when p 1 2 the output rate is only 1 4 elias and gill independently in 1972 showed how to increase the efficiency by mapping blocks of n input bits to variable length strings of output bits this procedure essentially attains the fundamental upper bound on efficiency the entropy of the input bits h p plog2 1 p q log2 1 q for large n both elias and gill stated without proof that the generalization of their procedure to inputs obtained from arbitrary finite state markov processes was trivial both were wrong manuel blum in 1986 demonstrated that although the output bits were unbiased they were not always independent a surprisingly simple modification to the obvious generalized procedure guarantees independence in this presentation i will describe blum's algorithm time permitting i will discuss the reverse problem and describe knuth and yao's optimal procedure for generating biased bits from fair bits
