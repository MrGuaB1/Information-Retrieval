exo slac rotations slac home description publications pictures talks history jobs collaboration only rotation possibilities overview exo 200 a time projection chamber utilizing 200 kg of liquid xenon enriched in isotope 136 has recently observed the never before seen 2 neutrino double beta decay of xe 136 this is a standard model process and the slowest process directly observed by humans half life 10 21 years the ultimate goal of exo 200 however is to set limits on or observe the neutrinoless double beta decay mode which would indicate the neutrino is a majorana particle that is its own antiparticle already massive neutrinos have provided some of the first hints of physics beyond the standard model a majorana neutrino would be the first fundamental majorana particle observed and evidence for lepton number violation which could explain why the universe is made of matter and not antimatter it would also provide a measurement of the still unknown mass of the neutrinos so despite our sucess there's lots more to do advantages the exo collaboration is relatively small but is currently taking data almost faster than our analysis teams can keep up there are plenty of opportunities for graduate students to contribute significantly to the analysis of this data additionally exo combines many different fields of physics from amo for barium tagging to hep detector technology it takes lots of cryogenics vacuum systems controls electronics and low radioactive background engineering techniques to bring it together so students involved learn a lot that can be applied to any future research and how many other experiments allow you to brag that your experiment is 2000 ft underground in a salt mine used for nuclear waste disposal specific areas exo 200 simulation and data analysis exo 200 is looking for a process with a half life orders of magnitude beyond the age of the universe our analysis will have to optimize energy resolution to pick out the monoenergetic zero neutrino mode decay and get good background rejection right now our analysis is manpower limited and there are great opportunities for motivated grad students to make significant contributions some possible topics include detector simulations signal background separation waveform analysis and fitting exo 200 hardware electronics and controls the exo 200 tpc utilizes 200 kg of liquid xenon to search for the double beta decay of 136 xe because the process is rare the detector is made of low background materials including an ultra thin copper vessel additionally xenon is only liquid at cryogenic temperatures and greater than atmospheric pressures this poses unique engineering and hardware challenges a slow controls system maintains the xenon at the correct temperature and minimizes the pressure differential between the interior and exterior of this thin vessel the low background nature of the experiment also poses novel electronics problems for example solid state avalanche photodiodes apds are used instead of traditional photomultiplier tubes interested rotation students would join the slac group to work on both the slow controls software and hardware and on the tpc readout electronics that collect the physics data including preparing for possible hardware upgrades and improvements to make exo 200 more sensitive barium tagging one important feature of the next generation tonne scale exo experiment is the ability to retrieve and tag individual double beta decay barium 136 daughter nuclei as part of the r&d effort the slac group is building an apparatus to study desorption and ionization processes of barium from a solid surface specific rotation projects include building and testing a time of flight spectrometer building a laser desorption and electron gun heating systems developing labview base data acquisition systems and studying single atom desorption and ionization processes who to talk to if you re intersted in any of the above some combination of the above or just exo and exo 200 please contract us prof martin breidenbach leads the slac group and you can also talk to dr peter rowson for a grad student's perspective you can contact current ph d student steve herrin owner haulman maintained by s herrin updated 2011 09 15 valid xhtml 1.0 strict
