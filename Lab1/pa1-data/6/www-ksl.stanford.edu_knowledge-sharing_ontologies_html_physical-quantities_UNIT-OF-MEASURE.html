class unit of measure in theory physical quantities class unit of measure defined in theory physical quantities source code physical quantities lisp slots on this class documentation a unit of measure is a constant quantity that serves as a standard of measurement for some dimension for example the meter is a unit of measure for the length dimension as is the inch square feet is a unit for length length quantities units of measure can be defined as primitives or can be defined as products of units or units raised to real exponents there is no intrisic property of a unit that makes it primitive or fundamental rather a system of units defines a set of orthogonal dimensions and assigns units for each therefore there is no distinguished class for fundamental unit of measure the magnitude of a unit of measure is always a positive real number using any comparable unit units are not scales which have reference origins and can have negative values units are like distances between points on scales any composition of units and reals using the and expt functions is also a unit of measure for example the quantity three meters is denoted by the expression 3 meter there is an identity unit that forms and abelian group with the operator over units of measure that means is commutative and associative for units it is also commutative for multiplying units and other constant quantities this is important for factoring out units from expressions containing tensors or functions subclass of constant quantity axioms and unit of measure a constant quantity b a b b a and unit of measure a real number b unit of measure expt a b abelian group unit of measure identity unit unit of measure u and constant quantity u forall other unit and unit of measure other unit compatible quantities u other unit and real number magnitude u other unit positive magnitude u other unit
