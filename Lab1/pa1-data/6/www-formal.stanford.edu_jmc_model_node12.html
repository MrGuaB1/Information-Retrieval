knowledge set and knowledge base next up previous next informal presentation of the up the puzzle of unfaithful previous the puzzle of unfaithful knowledge set and knowledge base let l be any language we will make the notion of the totality of one's knowledge explicit by the following definitions definition is a knowledge set for st if k satisfies the following conditions ks1 k is consistent ks2 where ks3 if then for some definition is a knowledge base for st if b satisfies the following conditions kb1 b is consistent kb2 where kb3 if then for some by ks2 or kb2 we see that any element in k or b esp has the form it is easy to see that if b is a knowledge base for st then is a knowledge set for st let be consistent we compare the following three conditions if then if then for some if then or then we have the following lemma 5 1 2 and 3 are equivalent we now study the semantical characterization of knowledge sets let be any kt5 model for any and we define by since as we will see below is a knowledge set for st we call it the knowledge set for st at w lemma 6 is a knowledge set for st let k be a knowledge set for st we say characterizes k if theorem 7 any knowledge set is characterizable yasuko kitajima fri jun 20 13 39 43 pdt 1997
