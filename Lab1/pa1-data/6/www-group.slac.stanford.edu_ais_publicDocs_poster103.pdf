a dual mission page 1 advanced instrumentation seminars september 17 2008 1 30 pm 1st floor kavli auditorium guest speaker peter von ballmoos cesr a dual mission for nuclear astrophysics nuclear gamma rays present an extraor dinary scientific potential for the study of the most powerful sources and the most violent events in the universe in order to take full advantage of this potential the next generation of instru mentation for this domain will have to achieve an improvement in sensitivity over present technologies of at least an order of magnitude the requirements for a future mission naturally can be divided into two subsets a requirement for medium sensitivity large scale exposures and very deep pointed observations this duality is naturally addressed by the dual mission concept which employs a wide fov compton telescope perform ing deep all sky surveys in combination with a laue lens that enables simultaneously very deep observations of selected narrow field targets utilizing the compton camera as its focal plane over the mission lifetime a compton all sky telescope can produce sensitive surveys in the energy range of hard x soft gamma rays ie 60 kev to 2 mev mapping out the extended distributions of galactic positron annihilation radiation and of various long lived cosmic radioactivities surveying a very large sample of galactic and extragalactic compact sources by characterizing their nonthermal spectra and study their variability on all timescales constraining the origin of soft gamma ray cosmic background radiation simultaneous to the all sky survey the laue lens will observe a number of selected compact sources at gamma ray lines of highest astrophysical relevance with a narrow line sensitivity of the order of a several 10 7 ph s 1 cm 2 ie the 511 kev positron annihilation and the 847 kev radioactive decay line of 56co by measuring the intensities shifts and shapes of their gamma ray lines http www group slac stanford edu ais
