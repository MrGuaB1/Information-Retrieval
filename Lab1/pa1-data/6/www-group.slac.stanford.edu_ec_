group c about us about us group c is one of the departments in the research division at the stanford linear accelerator center members of group c play prominent roles in babar the large experiment operating at the pep ii storage ring complex on site the principal goals of this experiment are to search for violation of cp invariance in neutral b mesons achieved in 2000 to further explore cp violating effects and gain a more in depth understanding of this important and still puzzling phenomenon to probe decays of b mesons and other heavy flavor particles for signs of phenomena that are inconsistent with our current understanding of particle physics to perform a comprehensive survey of many millions of particle interactions these studies are fundamental to our understanding of the standard model of weak interactions cp violation is believed to be a key to our understanding of the observation that the world we live in is predominantly made of matter with almost no anti matter contact information physics research vera luth or aaron roodman administrative barbara valdez last modified on june 14 2007 by barbara valdez original design by nuria e ayala
