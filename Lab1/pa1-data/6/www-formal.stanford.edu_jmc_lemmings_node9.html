geometric objects and relations next up previous contents next geography of game1 up objects in space in previous objects in space in geometric objects and relations here are some useful geometric objects and relations two dimensional objects regions including chambers we have already discussed them one dimensional objects segments and walls a segment is a surface over which lemmings can walk mostly we are concerned with segments bounded by walls or drop offs or other impediment to walkers however segments bounded by being above a hill at a lower level may need to be an object because digging in that segment has a different result than digging elsewhere on walls useful segments are bounded by overhangs as well as floors and ceilings because climbers can t climb overhangs bridges and segments of bridges require special treatment because they are dynamic until completed even when it is complete it is sometimes necessary to break a bridge into two segments using a digger the adjacency relations and containment relations among geometric objects are used john mccarthy mon mar 2 16 21 50 pdt 1998
