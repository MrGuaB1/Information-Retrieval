representation symbolic maps next up previous next region based analysis up support for array previous support for array representation symbolic maps more formally a symbolic value expression is either unknown or an arbitrary arithmetic conditional expression in terms of constants variables and loop indices a symbolic map binds variables to symbolic descriptions of their values a symbolic map associated with a region r may be either relative or absolute in a relative map variables within bound values refer to their values on entry to r in an absolute map no bound value may contain a variable modified within r for convenience below we define an operation on symbolic map and symbolic value which yields unknown if contains a not bound in and otherwise yields with every occurrence of a bound by replaced by the bound value saman amarasinghe mon oct 2 11 00 22 pdt 1995
