some plots of e some plots of energy deposits in the calorimeter pdr core meeting 29 aug 2001 steve asked me to check the energy loss in the calorimeter for muons mainly i suppose to force me to look at something other than tkr variables in the course of this little exercise i nagged toby and he re activated two very handy features of fluxsvc pencil beams and illumination of patches the former is used here to study the calorimeter response to normal 10 gev muons like the one shown here and here's the calorimeter response with a fit to a landau distribution a standard fitting function of root i also ran the same events through aorecon and obtained exactly the same result which is not surprising since the response in both cases comes directly from the digitization in gismo except that the aorecon result is expressed in gev and the result of the current reconstruction is in mev here's the plot from sasha's presentation of june 28 comparing gismo blue with geant3 black the results for gismo agree very well sasha's mean of 112.6 0.42 and my result above of 112.2 0.15 errors are obtained from the rms deviations around the mean however even with limited statistics you can see that the gismo distributions are not in complete agreement with the geant3 result which seems to be higher by about 3 4 mev this is about as far as i can go without knowing how sasha got the geant3 distribution steve also asked me to check the angular dependence of the energy deposit to do this i generated muons at an angle of 52.8 o to the normal this is the angle of the longest diagonal of the csi logs and the response the fit quantity called mean is actually the peak of the landau distribution the ratio of the peaks 99.95 166.4 0.601 is almost exactly equal to cos 52.8 o 0.604
