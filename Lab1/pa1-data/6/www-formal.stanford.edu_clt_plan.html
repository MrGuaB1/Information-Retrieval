formal specification of an active networks programming language formal specification of an active networks programming language mark oliver stehr and carolyn talcott keywords active networks plan switchware formal specification active networks are networks with nodes that do not operate according to a fixed scheme eg as conventional routers but are instead fully programmable and provide execution environments for programs that can be received from other nodes via the network an active network does not necessarily have a static topology so that also unreliable wireless and hybrid networks are subsumed by this notion the development of suitable programming paradigms for active network applications is an important research objective a particularly interesting paradigm is supported by the active network programming language plan which has been developped and implemented by the group of carl a gunter at the university of pennsylvania on an abstract level plan can be regarded as language with built in support for mobility it is based on a functional programming language with a concept of location and remote function invocation which is quite different from the remote procedure calls known from conventional languages remote function invocations are asynchronous and they can be recursive and typically coincide with a change of location which is realized by the emission of packets containing chunks ie programs as data furthermore plan allows programming with side effects and services which can be location dependent another aspect is resource awareness which ensures that all plan programs are terminating our contribution is a specification of plan and in fact of a more general language using rewriting logic as a formal specification language the formal specification is executable and therefore provides an execution environment of plan programs the specification uses an abstract reduction machine based on a technique inspired by felleisen which provides a more high level view than the standard secd approach the specification also benefits from the use of cinni a new calculus of names and substitutions which make the issues of bindings and environments precise without going into implementation details there are other interesting aspects such as multi level concurrency and locality of information that are nicely captured by multiset rewriting in rewriting logic in summary the high level nature of our specification provides not only a suitable level for abstract execution but more importantly for mathematical reasoning and formal theorem proving on the other hand the formal specification is intuitive easy to understand and can serve as a useful guide for application programmers and language implementors relevant references jose meseguer peter csaba olveczky mark oliver stehr and carolyn l talcott maude as a wide spectrum framework for formal modeling and analysis of active networks in darpa active networks conference and exposition dance san francisco may 2002 ieee 2002 available here mark oliver stehr and carolyn l talcott specifying an active network programming language in rewriting logic manuscript sri international and university of hamburg november 2001 a shorter version is available here mark oliver stehr and carolyn l talcott termination of active network programs manuscript sri international and university of hamburg february 2002 mark oliver stehr and carolyn talcott plan in maude specifying an active network programming language fourth international workshop on rewriting logic and its applications wrla 2002 pisa italy september 19 21 2000 electronic notes in theoretical computer science 71 elsevier 2002 entcs link references concerned with the plan language and its implementation can be found here information about the relation between plan and the more restricted snap language can be found here our specification of plan was part of the darpa project maude a wide spectrum formal language for secure active networks the formal specification in maude 2.0 available here can be found here this package contains the following files readme instructions on how to run the examples plan syntax m specification of the programming language syntax plan sorts m various sorts values nonvalues etc used in the specification plan network m network related sorts operations plan semantics m operational semantics of the language pm loads the entire specification ie all the files above topologies m definitions of two different network topologies semantics runs m execution of various simple examples find examples m definitions of two active network programs find runs m execution of these programs on the above topologies
