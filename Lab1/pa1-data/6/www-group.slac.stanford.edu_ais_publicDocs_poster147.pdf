advanced instrumentation seminars page 1 wafer level packaging processes has been used over several years in hybrid pixel module manufacturing deposi on processes like electropla ng spu ering as well as evapora on are well established technologies for the forma on of interconnec on structures on readout chip wafers as well as on sensor wafers following the packaging roadmaps to higher integra on increased func onality and a reduc on in size 3d wafer level packaging technologies come into the focus of technology development the forma on of through silicon vias tsvs is a key technology for the fabrica on of 3d architectures on wafer level therefore new concepts of wafer thinning thin wafer handling and via filling processes have to be developed an overview of 3d integra on technologies will be given focusing on the special requirements for pixel module fabrica on chip size packages for different applica ons using 3d wafer level integra on technologies were fabricated at fraunhofer izm examples of 3d chip size packages using tsv technology will be described in detail in this presenta on trends in wafer level packaging for pixel detector applica ons http www group slac stanford edu ais advanced instrumentation seminars guest speaker thomas fritzsch fraunhofer izm berlin germany november 16 2011 1 30 pm kavli auditorium
