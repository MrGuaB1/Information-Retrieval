new page 0 peter loch i am an associated research scientist in the experimental elementary particle physics group at the university of arizona i received my phd in experimental particle physics from the university of hamburg germany in 1992 at that time i was a member of the h1 collaboration at hera and studied the calibration of the calorimeter for electrons hadrons and jets after a brief assignment as a post doc at the university of arizona in 1992 1993 where i worked on the design and prototyping of the forward calorimeter for the long since defunct gem detector and some response studies for the dzero calorimeter at the tevatron i rejoined h1 for a forward energy flow analysis and detailed studies of jet reconstruction in deep inelastic scattering early 1995 i moved back to arizona now as a research scientist to join the atlas experiment at lhc first to help with the design construction and testing of the forward calorimeter later i moved from detector construction to general calorimeter jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction software all topics to which i still actively contribute i accepted several leadership positions in atlas including calorimeter simulation coordination calorimeter reconstruction software coordination and jet and missing transverse energy reconstruction co coordinator 2004 2008 besides other past and present comittee and task force work in atlas and us atlas i am also presently the us atlas software manager involvement and plans with slac my relation to slac started shortly after the high energy physics group joined atlas and has developed into a very productive collaboration on topics of common interest in addition slac's interest and potential to develop into a us west coast based intellectual and resource center for high precision analysis of atlas experimental data and the willingness to in particular support efforts at universities in the region including eg the university of arizona generated my interest in supporting this endeavour and helping with the collection of requirements and use cases from the point of view of smaller groups at these universities this election for the sluo executive committee opens an opportunity for me to assume an even more efficient and active role in supporting slac and helping define its future from my recent experiences in us atlas i believe that my most useful contribution would be in helping to increasing slac's role as a host institute not only for the high energy physics activities at lhc and possibly even a future ilc but also for the non accelerator based particle astrophysics program in the us i am very sure i can help with securing funds for ongoing and continuing support and with developing strategies for future involvements and an active physics program in addition i believe that i can contribute to strengthen slac's role as an intellectual center on the us west coast mostly by helping with physics program computing resource planning and organizational issues lastly i have a severe interest in attracting young people to high energy physics and thus would be interested to help with outreach activities
