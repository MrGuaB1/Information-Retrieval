transcoders leitch transcoders leitch cav2sdirgbs ntsc2sdicav sdi2cav usage the dec 6801 transcodes ntsc composite signals into serial digital sdi signals in our setup it outputs to the sdi router and also into a vcm 6801 which produces an ouput on the yuv router there are no user adjustments tbc and jittery signals from decks this transcoder requires a clean signal the jittery signal from playback on a vcr is not good enough you must pass the signal through a tbc first of course you could also use the tbc to do the transcoding but thats a seperate issue signal delay the dec 6801 seems to delay the input signal by 1 8 of a frame width while this is a short amount of time its annoying if your signal started out genlocked and comes out still synced but delayed a little if this signal later passes through the faroudja for example it will get shifted over since the sync line into the faroudja is not delayed there is an add on card that turns this thing into a des 6801 which adds a frame sync fixing the problem we didn t get it and i think its reasonanbly expensive another option would just be a delay circuit that would force a full scan line of delay which isn t as bad as 1 8 scan line since you won t notice a downward shift of one these things are about $200 but i think there are signal quality issues delay lines i think suppress high frequencies connection configuration hints additional notes troubleshooting return to main video menu videolab graphics stanford edu last modified wed nov 11 01 25 00 pst 1998
