foundations of statistical natural language processing foundations of statistical natural language processing christopher d manning and hinrich schutze chapter 6 statistical estimation n gram models over sparse data links referred to in the text cmu cambridge statistical language modeling toolkit and its documentation the best freely available tool for building language models the austen text files which were used to build sample language models were obtained from project gutenberg perhaps try the sailor's project gutenberg site mirror to remove punctuation from the text files we used the following unix sed script sed strip it specifies a number of global substitutions in terms of very simple regular expressions if sed is not available it would be very easy to write the same thing in perl or one could just do the substitutions in a text editor but here are the resulting clean text files that we used training data a concatenation of various novels and test data cleaned up persuasion the good turing estimates for austen in table 6.8 were calculated using gale and sampson's 1995 simple good turing technique using sampson's c program sgt c available from his website the frequency of frequency data that was used as input is available in this file to do exercise 6.6 what you might want to do is use a language modelling toolkit to generate raw n grams a perl program to do counts over those n grams and then to feed those into sgt c for good turing estimation this file gives examples of some of the commands we used in calculations in the chapter using standard unix commands and programs from the cmu cambridge statistical language modeling toolkit recipes txt gertjan van noord's table of language identification systems available on the www teaching materials powerpoint slides by jonathen henke uc berkeley reproduced with permission of the author other links of interest the sri language modeling toolkit by andreas stolcke is another good system for building language models freely available for research purposes christopher manning and hinrich schutze
