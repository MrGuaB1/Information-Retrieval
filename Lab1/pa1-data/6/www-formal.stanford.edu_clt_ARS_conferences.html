deduction conferences conferences relevant for mechanized reasoning this page is still under construction so it is by no means complete for a better service to the mecanized reasoning community i will need your help so please contribute send any links suggestions encouragement or donations by clicking here click here usa or here germany for a general mechanized reasoning page there is also a collection of conference announcements that can be used as a backup on more up to date information conferences specializing on deduction for an overview on conferences with an overlap to logic see here furthermore the www virtual library maintinas list of conferences on logic and reasoning below we have inserted some information on events of special interest to deduction cade the conference on automated deduction is the most important conference for classical automated theorem proving the first conference was held in 1974 previous cades have been mostly biennial and annual conferences started in 1996 lpar the international conference on logic programming and automated reasoning has traditionally been held on a ship somewhere in the former east block the series terminated in 1994 and is restarting 1999 in tbilisi rta the conference on rewriting techniques and applications tableaux an international conference that is concerned with tableau based deduction systems jelia joint european workshop on logic in aritificial intelligence workshops specializing on deduction unif the annual workshop on unification theory tphol the international workshop on theorem proving in higher order logic meets anually previous workshops were mainly concerned with theory and applications of the hol system the conference has broadened its scope beyond hol ctrs the workshop on conditional term rewriting systems extended abstracts from ctrs 94 can be obtained via ftp the goal of the qed workshop is to determine whether it is possible to change the qed project from a fascinating concept into a practical cooperation a first qed workshop ftp is a workshop focusing on first order theorem proving as a core theme of automated deduction there have been two meetings ftp97 at schloss hagenberg austria and ftp98 at wien conferences and workshops also covering deduction topics lics the international symposion on logic in computer science is concerned with the logical foundations of computer science it is natural that deduction plays a significant role in this setting ijcai and ecai international joint and european conference on artificial intelligence cover all of artificial intelligence but have an interesting section on deduction they are alternating biennial conferences ccl the international conference on constraints in computational logics is concerned with constraint logic programming but contraint techniques are also relevant for deduction ccl 94 took place at munich germany in september 1994 disco symposium on design and implementation of symbolic computation systems pasco symposium on parallel symbolic computation this page comes to you courtesy of michael kohlhase and carolyn talcott last updated march 24 1999
