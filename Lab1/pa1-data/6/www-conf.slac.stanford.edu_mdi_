mdi at the ilc home workshop machine detector interface at the international linear collider slac january 6 8 2005 scope and goals evaluate experiment impact of the ilc design the ilc design impacts the ilc detector and physics beyond just the delivered luminosity and energy reach the machine detector interface mdi group needs to evaluate how the ilc design impacts the experiment detector design and physics capabilities and how the experimental requirements impact the ilc design give input to both the i lc beam delivery group and the world wide study for ilc physics and detectors regarding critical choices beam tests the cdr and the tdr address viability and issues for crossing angle choices head on 300 m rad vertical 2 mrad horizontal 7 mrad horizontal 12 25 mrad horizontal form international sub groups working on individual topics and identify available and needed resources this workshop is an important milestone preparing for the cdr and for subsequent meetings at lcws march 2005 and snowmass august 2005 latest workshop news workshop photos slac content woods pages arias
