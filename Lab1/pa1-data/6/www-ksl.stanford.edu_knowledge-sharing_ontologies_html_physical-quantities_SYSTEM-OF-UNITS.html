class system of units in theory physical quantities class system of units defined in theory physical quantities source code physical quantities lisp slots on this class documentation a system of units is a class of units of measure that defines a standard system of measurement each instance of the class is a canonical unit of measure for a dimension the mapping from dimensions to units in the system is provided by the function called standard unit since this mapping is functional and total there is exactly one unit in the system of units per dimension there is no intrinsic property of a dimension that makes it fundamental or primitive and neither is there any such property for units of measure however each system of units is defined by a basis set of units from which all other units in the system are composed the function base units maps a system of units to its basis set the dimensions of the units in the base set must be orthogonal see the definition of fundamental dimension set for each composition of these fundamental dimensions eg length time there is a corresponding unique unit in the system of units eg meter second of time the system international si standard used in physics is a system of units based on seven fundamental dimensions and base units other systems of units may have different basis sets of differing cardinality yet share some of the same units as the si system subclass of class slots on instances of this class subclass of unit of measure base units slot cardinality 1 axioms system of units system and class system subclass of system unit of measure instance of unit system standard unit system quantity dimension unit unit value cardinality system base units 1 member unit base units system instance of unit system orthogonal dimension set setofall dim exists unit and member unit base units system dim quantity dimension unit notes example system of units si unit can any set of units be the base set for a system of units no the base units in a system of units must not be compositions of each other for example if the base units included meter second of time and unit meter second of time then it would not be a system of units because the dimension of unit meter second of time is length dimension time dimension which is a composition of other fundamental dimensions
