using line integral convolution for flow visualization curvilinear grids variable speed animation and unsteady flows using line integral convolution for flow visualization curvilinear grids variable speed animation and unsteady flows lisa forssell and scott cohen ieee transactions on visualization and computer graphics volume 1 1995 abstract line integral convolution lic introduced by cabral and leedom in siggraph 93 is a powerful technique for imaging and animating vector fields we extend the lic technique in 3 ways the existing algorithm is limited to vector fields over a regular cartesian grid we extend the algorithm and the animation techniques possible with it to vector fields over curvilinear surfaces such as those found in computational fluid dynamics simulations we introduce a technique to visualize vector magnitude as well as vector direction ee variable speed flow animation we show how to modify lic to visualize unsteady time dependent flows our implementation utilizes texture mapping hardware to run in real time which allows our algorithms to be included in interactive applications
