diamond detectors page 1 advanced instrumentation seminars september 05 2007 1 30 pm 1st floor kavli auditorium guest speaker harris kagan ohio state university diamond detectors in high radiation environments progress in experimental particle phys ics in the coming decade depends crucially upon the ability to carry out experiments at high energies and high luminosities these two conditions imply that future experiments will take place in very high radiation areas in order to perform these complex and perhaps expensive experiments new radiation hard technologies will have to be developed chemical vapor deposition cvd diamond is being developed as a radiation tolerant material for use very close to the interaction region where detectors may have to operate in extreme radiation conditions during the past few years many cvd diamond devices have been manufactured and tested as a detector for high radiation environments cvd diamond benefits substantially from its radiation hard ness very low leakage current low dielectric constant fast signal collection and ability to operate at room temperature we will present the present state of the art of poly crystalline cvd diamond and the latest results obtained from detectors constructed with this material recently a new type of diamond has been developed single crystal cvd diamond which resolves many of the issues associated with polycrystalline mate rial we will also present recent results obtained from devices constructed from this new diamond material finally we will discuss the use of diamond detectors in present and future experiments and their survivability in the highest radiation environments http www group slac stanford edu ais
