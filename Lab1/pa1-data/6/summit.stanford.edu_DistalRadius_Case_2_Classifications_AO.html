anatomy contemporary classifications anatomy ao 1987 page 6 of 50 muller with permission this classification like the other long bone ao classifications are grouped in type a extraarticular type b partial articular and type c complete intraarticular fractures whereas the detailed descriptions that include comminution provide useful information regarding fracture severity the interobserver consistency is poor with this rather cumbersome system although the author's preferred system according to andersen and kreder initial displacement is not a severity factor a modification of the ao classification using only seven groups of intra articular fractures has helped to improve inter observer reliability particularly when employing the ct scan to define radiocarpal comminution only fracture lines as defined as having 1 mm or greater displacement are used in grading subcategories in the ao classification for distal radius fractures result in 27 varieties 3 types a b c with 3 subdivisions of each 1 2 3 the _ 3 designation for both the a and c type fractures indicate extension into the diaphysis which creates a more unstable fracture technically an extension into the metaphyseal diaphyseal junction would fit in this category since it creates a more unstable picture and is more problematic to treat the comminuted fracture a3 3 or c2 3 for example is often undercalled since the xray rarely appears like the picture
