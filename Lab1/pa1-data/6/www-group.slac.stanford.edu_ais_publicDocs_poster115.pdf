nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging page 1 advanced instrumentation seminars guest speaker daniel rugar ibm research division nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging the quest for a molecular structure microscope can a microscope be built that can directly image the 3d atomic struc ture of individual biomolecules motivated by this question we are working to dramatically enhance the resolution of magnetic resonance imaging mri using a technique called magnetic resonance force microscopy or mrfm mrfm achieves a 100 million fold improve ment in sensitivity over conventional mri by replacing the traditional inductive pickup with ultrasensitive detection of magnetic force combining this sensitivity improvement with novel methods for spin manipulation we have successfully detected nanoscale ensembles of nuclear spins such as 1h 13c 19f and 31p by carefully measuring the mag netic force from the nuclear spins as a function of position a 3d image of nuclear spin density can be reconstructed as a first demonstration we show a 3d reconstruction of the hydrogen in a test sample of tobacco mosaic virus particles spatial resolution on the order of 4 nm was obtained prospects for pushing the resolution below 1 nm and turn ing this technique into a useful tool for structural biology will be discussed http www group slac stanford edu ais april 29 2009 1 30 pm 1st floor kavli auditorium
