sakshi arora's research page fully integrated high efficiency dc dc power conversion faculty bruce wooley student sakshi arora research summary power inductors are a hindrance to the miniaturization of switching dc dc converters this work focuses on study analysis and design of dc dc converters with multiple regulated outputs from a single supply without any external bulky inductor using multiple outputs as the supplies of different functional blocks reduces the power consumption of portable applications as a whole raising the frequency by approximately two orders of magnitude above the conventional power converters facilitates miniaturizing the converter however reduction in efficiency comes as a trade off and a challenge this research aims at designing fully integrated dc dc converters by innovating topologies and leveraging circuit techniques that give an appreciable performance on efficiency front education ph d candidate in electrical engineering stanford university 2009 present ms electrical engineering stanford university 2007 2009 be electrical engineering birla institute of technology and science pilani india 2001 2005 contact information center for integrated systems 077 via ortega & via pueblo stanford university stanford ca 94305 email sakshi stanford edu ic lab integrated circuits lab cis center for integrated systems stanford stanford university home people projects publications links e mail cis home page ic lab
