visualizing flow over curvilinear grid surfaces using line integral convolution visualizing flow over curvilinear grid surfaces using line integral convolution lisa forssell proc ieee visualization 94 washington dc october 17 22 1994 abstract line integral convolution lic introduced by cabral and leedom in siggraph 93 is a powerful technique for imaging and animating vector fields we extend the lic paradigm in three ways 1 the existing technique is limited to vector fields over a regular cartesian grid we extend it to vector fields over parametric surfaces specifically those found in curvilinear grids used in computational fluid dynamics simulations 2 periodic motion filters can be used to animate the flow visualization when the flow lies on a parametric surface however the motion appears misleading we explain why this problem arises and show how to adjust the lic algorithm to handle it 3 we introduce a technique to visualize vector magnitudes as well as vector direction cabral and leedom have suggested a method for variable speed animation which is based on varying the frequency of the filter function we develop a different technique based on kernel phase shifts which we have found to show substantially better results our implementation of these algorithms utilizes texture mapping hardware to run in real time which allows them to be included in interactive applications additional information available text of full paper without images 24k bytes postscript of full paper with images 2 mb maker interchange format of paper without images 240k bytes postscript of colorplate 10 mb
