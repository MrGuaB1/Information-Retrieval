kelp forest carbon observatory page 1 a proposed monterey bay kelp forest carbon observatory the center for ocean solutions has proposed to build and operate a cabled observatory in the nearshore kelp forest adjacent to hopkins marine station and the monterey aquarium the system would include physical chemical and limited biological measurements including video imaging at various locations inside and outside of the kelp the purpose of the observatory would be to examine linked variability in physical and biogeochemical environments and biota physiology in a kelp forest upwelling system the carbon observatory will serve as a focus for climate change and marine ecosystems research in monterey bay by providing needed data on biogeochemical ecological and physical processes that will allow researchers to make uniquely detailed time series measurements of basic kelp forest functions the observing system will also allow researchers to address the critical policy issue of how to use ocean observing in a way that informs public policy for more information contact stephen monismith at monismith stanford edu proposed layout of kelp forest carbon observatory
