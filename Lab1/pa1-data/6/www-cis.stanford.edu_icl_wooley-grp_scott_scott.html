scott kulchycki's research page continuous time sigma delta modulation for high speed and high resolution a d conversion faculty bruce wooley student scott kulchycki research summary this research investigates the use of oversampling techniques for digitizing signals in a 10mhz bandwidth with at least 13 bits of resolution although sigma delta modulators have largely been implemented as discrete time dt circuits a continuous time ct design approach appears to offer several advantages for realizing high accuracy a d converters at signal bandwidths where technology considerations may impose significant constraints for a given technology and power dissipation ct modulators can operate at higher sampling rates than dt circuits because the operational amplifier bandwidth required is significantly lower ct modulators also provide inherent anti alias filtering since sampling occurs at the quantizer input rather than at the modulator input finally for the design objectives set forth in this program the thermal noise of a ct modulator is lower than for a comparable dt design education ph d candidate in electrical engineering stanford university ms candidate in electrical engineering stanford university ba sc electrical engineering simon fraser university 2001 contact information department of electrical engineering stanford university home 650 386 6510 office 650 725 8579 email skulchyc tidal stanford edu ic lab integrated circuits lab cis center for integrated systems stanford stanford university home people projects publications links e mail cis home page ic lab
