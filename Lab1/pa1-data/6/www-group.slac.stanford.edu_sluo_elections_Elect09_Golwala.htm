new page 0 sunil golwala i am an assistant professor at caltech my background is in particle astrophysics and cosmology i work on the supercdms wimp dark matter search on experiments to measure cmb polarization and studies of galaxy clusters using the sunyaev zeldovich effect and instrumentation for all these efforts i received my phd from berkeley spending a good deal of time on the stanford campus in hepl end station iii working on the first generation cryogenic dark matter search experiment that was sited there since 2000 i have been at caltech i am a new slac user having just begun my interaction with slac with the initiation of a supercdms group led by eduardo do couto e silva already though i have learned how the resources of a national facility like slac can make an enormous difference to the fields i work in which have historically been populated by university based collaborations slac is at a critical time it must redefine its mission and its role in serving the user community moving from a facility where the experiments are done and the science happens to being a facility that through its significant resources and stability can play a unique scientific technical and management role in broadly distributed projects particle astrophysics and cosmology the cosmic frontier are fields where slac has and will continue to play an important role to date slac has chosen to focus its contributions in a handful of major efforts in these fields but with the growing importance of these fields to our study of particle physics and the migration of particle physicists into these fields slac can take on a broader role supporting a wider range of work and putting together a full portfolio at the cosmic frontier i believe i have the broad knowledge of these fields as well as the interest in seeing slac participate fully in them to help the slac user community voice its opinions on this process and to help slac seek out the best opportunities in particle astrophysics and cosmology
