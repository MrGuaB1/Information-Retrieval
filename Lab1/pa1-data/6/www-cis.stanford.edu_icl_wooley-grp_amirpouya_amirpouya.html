amirpouya kavousian's research page power efficient linear cmos rf power amplifier faculty bruce wooley student amirpouya kavousian research summary in many of the emerging protocols for broadband wireless communications information is carried in both the amplitude and phase of the transmitted signal systems based on these protocols thus require the use of linear power amplification however conventional linear power amplifiers are far less efficient than amplifiers that need only provide a constant envelope output the objective of this project is to explore the design of efficient and linear power amplifiers that can be integrated in scaled cmos technologies education ph d candidate in electrical engineering stanford university ms electrical engineering stanford university 2003 bs electrical engineering sharif university of technology tehran iran 2001 contact information center for integrated systems 072 via ortega & via pueblo stanford university stanford ca 94305 4070 phone 650 725 4542 email pouya stanford edu ic lab integrated circuits lab cis center for integrated systems stanford stanford university home people projects publications links e mail cis home page ic lab
