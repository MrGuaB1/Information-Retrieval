recursive calls next related work up interprocedural algorithm previous applying a ptf recursive calls we use an iterative approach to handling recursive calls because of calls through pointers we must identify the recursive cycles as the analysis proceeds since we already keep a stack to record the calling contexts we can detect recursive calls by searching back to see if the call target is already on the stack instead of creating a new ptf for a recursive call we just use the summary from the ptf that is already on the call stack on the first iteration the summary may be empty and we may need to defer evaluation of the recursive call as long as there is some path that terminates the recursion however an approximate summary will eventually be provided the iteration then continues until it reaches a fixpoint the ptf at the entry to a recursive cycle is an approximation for multiple calling contexts we combine the aliases and function pointer values from each recursive call site with those recorded in the ptf that may change the input domain for the ptf so that it no longer matches the original non recursive calling context to avoid that problem we record two separate input domains for these recursive ptfs one specifies the original input domain for the call from outside the recursive cycle and the other combines the inputs from all the recursive calls next related work up interprocedural algorithm previous applying a ptf bob wilson
