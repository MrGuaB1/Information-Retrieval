a hardware f buffer implementation a hardware f buffer implementation mike houston arcot preetham and mark segal submitted to graphics hardware 2005 abstract we describe the hardware f buffer implementation featured in the latest ati graphics processors we discuss the implementation choices made in each chip and the various implementation challenges faced like overflow handling the f buffer was originally intended as a solution for multi pass shading we demonstrate this functionality comparing it to traditional multi pass rendering techniques and show performance results given hardware fbuffer support we describe extended uses like order independent blending we also show how a future f buffer implementation might be extended to allow more advanced operations like data filtering paper pdf
