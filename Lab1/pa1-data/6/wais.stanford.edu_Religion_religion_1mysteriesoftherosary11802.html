roman catholic church two new mysteries of the rosary back to index roman catholic church two new mysteries of the rosary tony mahowald writes although the original rosary had 15 decades of ave marias divided into three sets of mysteries the common custom is to make a rosary with only five decades as far as i know only some religious nuns and priests ever had a full rosary with 15 decades the common rosary has been divided into three sets of mysteries the joyful about the birth and early life of jesus the sorrowful about the passion and death and the glorious about the resurrection and afterlife contrary to your statement these mysteries have always been about christ's life not mary's although she figures prominently in the joyful mysteries since the custom is to meditate on the various mysteries while saying the ave marias one of the anomalies noted by many catholics was the absence of a consideration of the public life of christ so it is a welcome change to add a new set of five mysteries on the public life to the previous sets since every rosary sold only has five decades there is obviously no reason for the catholic woman in england to have to purchase a new rosary rh i simply said that the vatican now stresses the three sets of mysteries about the life of jesus rather than the cult of mary which was the theme of all discussions about the rosary in the past ronald hilton 11 8 02 webmaster
