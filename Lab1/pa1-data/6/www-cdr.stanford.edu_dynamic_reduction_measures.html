dynamic design lab projects dynamic desingn lab lab overview research directions people projects testbeds heavy truck safety performance measures braking efficiency the fraction of the available tire road friction that can be used without locking any wheels braking stability a measure of the directional stability of a vehicle under combined braking and turning dynamic load transfer ratio the fractional change in load between left and right side tires in an evasive maneuver effective overhang ratio the distance from the turn center to the rear of the trailer divided by the trailer wheelbase friction demand the tire pavement friction necessary for a truck to turn without jackknifing friction utilization the ratio of braking force to vertical load at each axle high speed steady state offtracking the lateral offset between the path of the first axle and the path of the last axle in a steady turn high speed transient offtracking the lateral overshoot of the last axle with respect to the path of the first axle in an evasive maneuver low speed transient offtracking the lateral offset between the path of the first axle and the path of the last axle in a right angle turn rearward amplification the ratio of the highest lateral acceleration of the last trailer to the highest lateral acceleration of the tractor during evasive maneuver primarily of concern for multi trailer units static rollover threshold the lateral acceleration at which the truck rolls over in a steady turn understeer coefficient a measure of how aggressively a truck responds to a steering input at a given lateral acceleration yaw damping ratio a measure of the attenuation in trailer oscillation initiated by a steering input
