wax property data for wax products produced by m argueso & co water soluble wax general descriptions solu glo&trade water soluble wax offers a safer simpler and less expensive technique for detection of soluble core residue prior to the shelling process it is critical that all of the water soluble core material be dissolved and removed from the pattern material if the water soluble material is not completely removed from the core the residue causes inaccuracy in the finished casting this further leads to reaction between the inorganic residue from the core material and the molten metal as the molten metal enters the mold the reaction results in a scrap casting it is important to inspect the cavity left from the dissolution of the core material to ensure that the cavity is free of residue from the core material such inspection is difficult because of inaccessibility of view areas in the cavity there are no special handling requirements for solu glo&trade it is melted injected and removed like any other standard soluble wax the uniqueness of the fluorescing effect can be incorporated in any argueso soluble wax the modification can be done without affecting the physical properties of the argueso soluble wax solu glo&trade soluble wax is recommended for a wide array of parts which range from simple to complicated internal configurations with narrow passages holes or undercuts property data n a investment casting wax cerita casting waxes general descriptions cerita casting waxes are custom formulated to meet today's complex investment casting needs from automobile rocker arms to jet engine turbine blades when manufacturer's want the best wax for their high precision manufacturing needs they turn to cerita casting waxes cerita waxes are available in flake slab pellet and billet forms property data n a back to material home sdm tutorial biomimetic robotics home cdr home stanford university last updated 11 22 1999
