the supply chain of co2 emissions about the data carnegie institution center for international climate and environmental research the supply chain of co 2 emissions steven j davis glen p peters and ken caldeira view and download data country specific graphics read the pnas paper about the data overview the analysis is based on fossil energy resources of coal oil natural gas and secondary fuels traded among 57 industrial sectors and 112 countries in 2004 narayanan and walmsley 2009 we use the term countries to describe the spatial disaggregation of this data though in some cases we intend collections of related countries co2 emissions produced in each country production emissions are calculated using country sector and fuel specific data of co 2 emissions per unit of energy using trade data these emissions are traced back to the point of extraction even if the extracted fuels were processed in and re exported from an intermediate country extraction emissions the forward link from production emissions to where goods are consumed consumption emissions are based on a global multi regional model that ties sector level economic data with trade data davis and caldeira 2010 the difference between production emissions and extraction emissions represents the net difference in emissions related to traded fuels and therefore equals emissions from imported fuels less emissions from exported fuels emissions from burning of traded fuels are distinct from emissions embodied in traded goods which are the emissions produced during manufacture of the goods the net of emissions embodied in trade represents the difference between production emissions and consumption emissions by combining emissions related to trade in fuels and goods it is possible to examine the difference between extraction emissions and consumption emissions and follow the supply chain of emissions from where fuels are extracted to where dependent goods or services are ultimately consumed trade data data on international trade economic input output by sector gdp population energy use and combustion based co2 emissions of each region sector are all taken from version 7.1 of the global trade analysis project gtap which compiles the primary data from voluntary contributions of each region and harmonizes them to remove conflicts and inconsistencies narayanan and walmsley 2009 models details of the multiregional input output model mrio used to calculate consumption emissions and the accounting model we developed to assess extraction emissions are available in the pnas paper and its supplemental information davis peters and caldeira 2011 definition of regions the following list defines the regions of aggregated countries used in our analysis and presentations of the data rest of oceania american samoa cook islands fiji french polynesia guam kiribati marshall islands federated states of micronesisa nauru new caledonia norfolk island northern mariana islands niue palau papua new guinea samoa solomon islands tokelau tonga tuvalu vanuatu wallis and futuna rest of east asia macau mongolia democratic people's republic of korea rest of southeast asia brunei darussalam timor leste myanmar rest of south asia afghanistan bhutan maldives rest of north america bermuda greenland saint pierre and miquelon rest of south america falkland islands french guiana guyana suriname belize rest of central america rest of c america el salvador honduras caribbean antigua and barbuda bahamas barbados dominica dominican republic grenada haiti jamaica puerto rico saint kitts and nevis saint lucia saint vincent and the grenadines trinidad and tobago us virgin islands british virgin islands anguilla aruba cayman islands cuba guadeloupe martinique montserrat netherlands antilles rest of the european free trade association iceland liechtenstein rest of eastern europe republic of moldova rest of europe andorra bosnia and herzegovina faroe islands gibraltar the former yugoslav republics of macedonia monaco san marino and serbia and montenegro rest of former soviet union rest of fss tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan rest of west asia middle east bahrain iraq israel jordan kuwait lebanon occupied palestinian territory oman qatar saudi arabia syrian arab republic united arab emirates yemen rest of north africa algeria libyan arab jamahiriya rest of west africa benin burkina faso cote d ivoire cape verde ghana guinea guinea bissau gambia liberia mali mauritania niger saint helena sierra leone togo rest of central africa central african republic cameroon congo gabon equitorial guinea sao tomo and principe chad rest of south central africa rest of sc africa angola the democratic republic of the congo rest of eastern africa burundi comoros djibouti eritrea kenya mayotte reunion rwanda somalia sudan seychelles rest of south african customs union lesotho namibia swaziland about the data contact us carnegie institution
