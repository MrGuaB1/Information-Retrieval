smt 2012 general tiebreaker and solutions february 18 2012 1 compute 12 22 32 182 192 202 answer s page 1 smt 2012 general tiebreaker and solutions february 18 2012 1 compute 12 22 32 182 192 202 answer 210 solution note that 2n 1 2 2n 2 2 4n 3 therefore the sum is equivalent to 9 i 0 2i 3 2 9 10 30 210 2 reimu and marisa are playing a game with 2012 coins reimu flips all 2012 coins and then is permitted to flip any subset of the 2012 coins exactly once more after this reimu pays marisa $2 for every head on the table whereas marisa pays reimu $1 for every tail on the table who is more likely to earn a profit and what is the expected profit for that person in dollars answer reimu $503 solution we compute the expected profit for a game using 1 coin and then multiply this by 2012 we are allowed to do this by linearity of expectation if reimu flips the coin and gets a tail then she receives $1 guaranteed if reimu flips the coin and gets a head instead she then reflips the coin and gets $1 with probability 1 2 and loses $2 with probability 1 2 therefore reimu expects to win 1 1 2 1 4 2 1 4 0.25 dollars multiplying by 2012 reimu expects to win $503 3 we define n to be a squarefree integer if for every prime p p2 does not divide n let f n be the sum of the reciprocals of all the divisors of n we define n to be an amazing integer if f n 2 how many squarefree amazing integers are there answer 1 solution note that f n  n n k i 1 pi 1 pi in order for f n to be integral the only primes that can divide n are 2 and 3 since those are the only consecutive primes note that f 6 2 but 1 2 and 3 do not satisfy this constraint therefore there is exactly 1 squarefree amazing integer
