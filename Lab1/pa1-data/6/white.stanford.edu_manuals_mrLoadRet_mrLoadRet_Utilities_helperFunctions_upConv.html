description of upconv home mrloadret utilities helperfunctions upconv m upconv purpose res upconv im filt edges step start stop res synopsis function result upconv im filt edges step start stop res description res upconv im filt edges step start stop res upsample matrix im followed by convolution with matrix filt these arguments should be 1d or 2d matrices and im must be larger in both dimensions than filt the origin of filt is assumed to be floor size filt 2 1 edges is a string determining boundary handling circular circular convolution reflect1 reflect about the edge pixels reflect2 reflect doubling the edge pixels repeat repeat the edge pixels zero assume values of zero outside image boundary extend reflect and invert dont compute zero output when filter overhangs output boundaries upsampling factors are determined by step optional default 1 1 a 2 vector y x the window over which the convolution occurs is specfied by start optional default 1 1 and stop optional default step size im floor start 1 step res is an optional result matrix the convolution result will be destructively added into this matrix if this argument is passed the result matrix will not be returned do not use this argument if you do not understand what this means note this operation corresponds to multiplication of a signal vector by a matrix whose columns contain copies of the time reversed or space reversed filt shifted by multiples of step see corrdn m for the operation corresponding to the transpose of this matrix cross reference information this function calls this function is called by upblur res upblur im levels filt generated on mon 21 sep 2009 23 59 05 by m2html 2005
