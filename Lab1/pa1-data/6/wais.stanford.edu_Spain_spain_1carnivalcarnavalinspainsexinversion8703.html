spain carnival carnaval in spain sex inversion back to index spain carnival carnaval in spain sex inversion john heelan makes a correction and a clarification of his piece about carnival in spain the correction there was an important word i left out when discussing carnival as a safety valve the sentence should have read during carnival the normal mores of a strict society about status sex and gender are relaxed for a short period and then re imposed after carnival time is over this relaxation allows emotions pent up over the year to be safely released with no major risk to the holders of power the clarification i responded solely to your question about sex inversion and carnaval as the message title states not making a general point on transvestism please make that clear to wais rh yes but sex inversion in carnival is only one aspect of the bigger phenomenon ronald hilton 8 7 03 webmaster
