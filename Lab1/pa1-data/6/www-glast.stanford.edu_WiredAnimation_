event displays event displays single event displays showing the detector information in graphical form from four of the many events that passed the nominal gamma ray selection criteria in the early mission engineering data note that the instrument is still undergoing tuning and detailed checkout in preparation for science observations but these events illustrate that the instrument is basically working very well in particular the sensors show very high detection efficiency with very low noise the event reconstruction software is also working well click on a thumbnail picture for a full sized image the green crosses show the detected positions of the charged particles the blue lines show the reconstructed track trajectories and the yellow line shows the candidate gamma ray estimated direction the red crosses show the detected energy depositions in the calorimeter the anticoincidence detector shows no incoming charged particles in these events
