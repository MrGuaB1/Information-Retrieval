tuolomne meadows june 2004 halfway up cathedral peak chuck and i ran into marshall polly joe whom i hadn t seen in at least 6 months and matt lappe who had just returned from chile the night before what a surprise cathedral was a zoo and each party got to choose their own adventure on the network of cracks we had 3 ropes crossing at one point and i accidentally cleaned one of marshall's cams sorry 4 5 pitches in all rated 5.6 on top of cathedral eikhorn pinnacle with matt lappe as the speck on top eikhorn pinnacle is one 5.4 pitch on the back side but it's very exposed with a long vertical drop below if you fell on the traverse around to the backside while following you would pendulum a lot if the lead fell at any time and the belayer were not anchored as the one's i saw weren t the belayer would go flying sideways and then down which would leave both climbers in an awkward dangling position if not injured if the lead fell before placing pro they could both end up several thousand feet below on the valley floor on top of eikhorn pinnacle cathedral in the background chuck on sunday we climbed hermaphrodite flake on the stately pleasure dome very cool weird chimney and the flake you crawl under seems like it could fall in the next earthquake 2 pitches rated 5.4 free web page hit counter
