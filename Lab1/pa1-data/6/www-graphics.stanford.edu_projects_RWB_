responsive workbench responsive workbench the responsive workbench is a 3d interactive workspace originally developed by wolfgang krueger at gmd computer generated stereoscopic images are projected onto a horizontal tabletop display surface via a projector and mirrors system and viewed through shutter glasses to generate the 3d effect a 6dof tracking system tracks the user's head so that the user sees the virtual environment from the correct point of view a pair of gloves and a stylus also tracked by the system can be used to interact with objects in the tabletop environment our current research involves extending the workbench environment to more efficiently support interaction visualization and collaboration to support interaction we have been researching techniques for two handed manipulation developing workbench tools or widgets and investigating various other interface metaphors appropriate for the workbench to support collaboration we working with fakespace have developed a two viewer version of the system the two viewer version is capable of simultaneously tracking the head position and displaying a stereo pair of images for two users to test the effectiveness of using the workbench for visualization we are currently exploring several different application areas including architecture scientific visualization and medicine we are also researching basic issues involved in building environments such as the workbench hardware calibration and rendering people maneesh agrawala andrew beers bernd frohlich pat hanrahan others have contributed in major ways cary kornfeld design of the original rwb sean anderson 3d stylus and sketching interface jeffrey feldgoise and julie dorsey architectural applications larry cutler two handed input martin fischer production planning steve bryson virtual windtunnel and yeva fineberg modeling the responsive workbench is a cooperative project between stanford university and gmd this project was supported by a grant from interval research corporation additional support for particular visualization applications is provided by darpa visualization of complex systems and cife contructions planning and in the past nasa ames virtual windtunnel equipment donations have been provided by silicon graphics computer systems and fakespace inc talks the responsive workbench two handed input and two user output presented by bernd frohlich at the 1997 immersive projected technology workshop two handed direct manipulation on the responsive workbench presnted by larry cutler and bernd frohlich at the 1997 symposium on interactive 3d graphics papers the two user responsive workbench support for collaboration through individual views of a shared space maneesh agrawala andrew c beers bernd frohlich and pat hanrahan stanford university ian macdowall and mark bolas fakespace inc proc siggraph 97 two handed direct manipulation on the responsive workbench lawrence d cutler bernd frohlich and pat hanrahan proc 1997 symposium on interactive 3d graphics related projects gmd's responsive workbench nrl's responsive workbench fakespace's immersive workbench uiuc evl's immersadesk ciemed's virtual workbench mit rle vett's virtual workbench nasa's virtual windtunnel virtual design studio unc grip project two user protein interactive theater pit last modified tue 16 jun 1998 rwb graphics stanford edu
