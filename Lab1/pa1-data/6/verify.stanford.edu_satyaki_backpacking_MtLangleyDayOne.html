the hike to the cottonwood lakes the hike to the cottonwood lakes saturday afternoon we started from the parking lot the last time we were here there was 6 of snow on the ground this time it was actually quite warm oh what a difference only a few months make after posing for the customary before the hike picture we were off the first day's hike would take us to the cottonwood lakes and would entail an elevation gain of about 1000ft so on the most part it was quite pleasant we hiked through a sparsely wooded forest with great views of the sierras in the distance the only slightly hard part was crossing a couple of narrow bridges and the mosquitos which seemed to be following us but we were well stocked with bug repellant so the latter was hardly a problem we saw quite a few people on horseback in fact the climb to mt langley is so easy that one could actually do the whole thing on horseback after the initial climb the last stretch was on an alpine meadow with majestic views of the high sierras we followed about the same route last time too but don t recall seeing the hut we came across this time we couldn t figure out what its purpose was soon we were skirting past the cottonwood lakes there are six of them and they are named cottonwood lake 1 thru 6 quite unimaginative if you ask me soon we found a suitable place to camp and cooked dinner over our little stove next mtlangleydaytwo satyaki das last modified tue jul 6 22 41 50 pdt 2004
