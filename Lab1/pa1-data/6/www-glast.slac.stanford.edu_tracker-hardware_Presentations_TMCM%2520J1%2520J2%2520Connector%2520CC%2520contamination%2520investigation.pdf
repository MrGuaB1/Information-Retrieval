tmcm j1 j2 connector conformal coat flow analysis page 1 tmcm j1 j2 connector conformal coat flow analysis this presentation illustrates an effort pursued by the tmcm quality team at glast slac to find cause of conformal coat flow and contamination into the mating surfaces of the j1 j2 connectors p n lat ds 00898 s n sn11016 a non flight unit was inspected for evidence of conformal coating flow beneath connector bodies and selected because it exhibits what has become a typical reject trend observed while performing incoming inspection as received from vendor the j1 j2 connector body were destruct lifted from the surface of the pwb solder joints left intact for this investigation for the purpose of this report when referring to j1 j2 connectors the term front side is used when viewing the connector from the circuit side backside is used when viewing from the connector saver hookup side page 2 tmcm j1 j2 connector conformal coat flow investigation j1 pwb smt front side view purple luminescence is caused by the use of uv light j1 pwb smt view2 page 3 tmcm j1 j2 connector conformal coat flow investigation j1e pwb smt view note flow of conformal coat and where it stopped smts are shadowed by connector body page 4 tmcm j1 j2 connector conformal coat flow investigation j2 edge beneath connector body pwb j2 connector body bottomside to pwb page 5 tmcm j1 j2 connector conformal coat flow investigation j2 bottomside to pwb no uv j2 pwb smt view page 6 tmcm j1 j2 connector conformal coat flow investigation j2e backside beneath connector body j2w backside beneath connector body
