csli interface lab interface laboratory these projects constitute a concerted effort at csli to address human computer interface problems emerging in the world of telecommunications information processing and consumer electronics brain research patrick suppes computational learning lab the computational learning laboratory carries out basic and applied research in machine learning including adaptive user interfaces data mining and learning for intelligent agents patrick langley computational semantics laboratory our lab is interested in applying research results to real world problems such as information retrieval natural language processing dialogue systems machine translation programming languages and cooperating software agents stanley peters disfluencies in speech what disfluencies tell us about speaking the disfluency project is investigating the many ways in which spontaneous speaking differs from idealized speaking we assume that speakers mark local features of their speech disfluencies to signal delays approximations mistakes changes of mind and other issues that come up in planning what to say our investigations are aimed at uncovering these features and their functions herbert h clark graphic displays how do people use space to convey spatial and abstract ideas how do people construct and comprehend graphic displays barbara tversky interactivity laboratory the interactivity lab is dedicated to research on human computer interaction our goal is to develop new devices techniques and theories that support the design of fluent interaction in a ubiquitous computing environment terry winograd linguistic grammars online the lingo linguistic grammars online project has developed natural language technology to support broad coverage precise processing for analysis and generation current research areas include organization of the lexicon incorporation of statistical techniques and discourse models and dialect variation ivan sag and dan flickinger lilac john perry the metaphysics research lab in this lab philosophers at stanford and elsewhere are collaborating on 1 a formal ontology project edward n zalta is collaborating with bernard linsky u alberta hannes leitgeb u bristol f jeffry pelleter simon fraser otavio bueno u miami and michael nelson u california riverside on developing a systematic theory of abstract objects such numbers sets properties physically possible objects etc 2 a computational metaphysics project zalta is collaborating with branden fitelson u california berkeley and paul oppenheimer csli to bring automated reasoning techniques to prove theorems in the metaphysics of abstract objects possible worlds complete concepts etc 3 the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy project the sep is a dynamic reference work in which professional philosophers around the world collaboratively maintain a refereed reference work that stays current because the authors and editors produce asynchonous vetted updates to track new research edward zalta natural language processing the natural language processing group is interested in getting computers to process and understand natural human languages particular interests include probabilistic models of natural language probabilistic parsing and grammar induction word sense disambiguation and deep semantic processing machine translation and clustering chris manning openproof the openproof project is developing theoretically informed tools to support reasoning problem solving and design tasks that employ multiple forms of representation for example graphical and textual the long term goal of the investigators is to implement and refine a newly developed architecture for recording structured reasoning and design rationales resulting from typically collaborative problem solving john etchemendy the spoken syntax lab the spoken syntax lab provides resources for collaborative work on syntax using multiple sources of evidence and modern statistical models the lab is developing repositories of aligned phonetic parsed and contextualized data as well as advanced search and analysis tools joan bresnan team coordination and collaboration larry leifer virtual theater project the virtual theater project studies the creation of intelligent automated characters that can act either in well defined stories or in improvisational environments barbara hayes roth home research publications affiliates events people information copyright 1995 2010 the board of trustees of the leland stanford junior university all rights reserved inquiries about csli may be directed to csli csli stanford edu comments about or corrections of the web pages may be directed to csli webmaster csli stanford edu last modified fri sep 22 14 41 04 pdt 2006 by emma csli stanford edu
