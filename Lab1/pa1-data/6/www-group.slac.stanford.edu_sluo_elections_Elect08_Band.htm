henry band henry band university of wisconsin i am a senior scientist at the university of wisconsin and have been resident at slac for many years i work currently work on babar as the ifr system manager with the sid detector r&d group on the advisory committee and outside of slac have just joined the daya bay experiment my past experiments include sld the slc polarization group several of the end station a polarized fixed target experiments e142 e154 and the mac experiment at the original pep as babar analysis winds down the composition and size of the hep user community will change dramatically over the next few years slac will need to balance the needs of the particle physics astrophysics and photon science communities it is important that babar and slac maintain appropriate resources in computing and office space for the full exploitation of the huge babar data set in addition to hosting atlas collaboration activities i believe that slac can play a useful role in supporting increased detector r&d for the next generation electron accelerator the sluo executive board should promote the needs of the hep users within slac while helping the lab to obtain the needed resources
