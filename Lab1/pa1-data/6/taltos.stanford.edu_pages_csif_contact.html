csif people and contact director jon mulholland 725 7532 e mail jwm stanford edu jon mulholland joined the beckman center's csif in 2001 and establised the new electron microscopy core while expanding existing fluorescent microscopy resources prior to joining the csif he worked for many years in the laboratory of dr david botstein starting at mit then genetech inc and finally stanford his research in the botstein lab focused on the ultrastructural biology of the yeast actin cytoskeleton and membrane vesicle trafficking while in the botstein lab he successfully applied immuno em methodologies which enabled the first immuno em study of the actin cytoskeleton in yeast he has expertise in both light and electron microscopy reseach interests continue to be centered upon improved light and electron imaging techniques for studying protein localization in yeast and other micro organisms fluorescence microscopy core staff kitty lee 723 2449 e mail microscopy stanford edu kitty has been taking care of the csif confocal microscopes and their users since 2002 she's a hong kong native who moved to the states in 1994 as a double major in chem and bio with minors in education and computer science kitty's college years were spent mostly outside her beloved dorm room split between cold computer room creepy bio lab nasty chem lab smelly animal facility busy student health clinic etc etc she spent some years at a neurobio lab that specializes in olfactory research a computational chem lab that seeks the least poisonous cancer ridding chemical conformation a cognitive psych lab that tests human response to image stimulus and a pet scan research that compares human brain images some of which scored her authorship in a journal publication or two her addiction to tantalizing csif users stems from her years of tutoring college students and helping clinic nurses handling patients latest interest for kitty outside csif includes ta ing wilderness first aid class was once emt certified and enjoys playing with fake blood telemark skiing snowcamping kayaking and hiking backpacking and shopping for all these activities kitty is an avid fencer who enjoys fencing foil and playing with epees please feel free to challenge her to a duel after your confocal imaging sessions she has a spare saber as well electron microscopy core staff john perrino 723 3462 e mail jperrino stanford edu lydia joubert 723 3462 e mail lydiaj stanford edu after majoring in mathematics and botany lydia obtained her phd in plant sciences and did post doctoral research on endophytic cyanobacteria eukariotic plant symbiosis subsequent research on lignocellulolytic fungal enzymes led to an interest in degradative microbial consortia and research in microbial ecology environmental engineering studying biofilms as complex microbial communities whose phenotypic plasticity affords the emergence of novel and superior competitive properties visualization with light and electron microscopy has been a central part of all her research and minimizing sample processing as enabled by variable pressure sem became a focus point due to the hydrated nature and delicate 3d architecture of biofilms application of wet sem techniques for nanotechnology application cryofixation for sem and correlative light and electron microscopy are currently being developed and applied she is also interestd in techniques for preserving and characterizing bacterial and yeast biofilms academic interests include earth systems theory and application of games theory as well as non linearity complexity and fractality to study biofilm behavior hobbies include lots of books and music photography jogging skiing hiking piano playing and her family
