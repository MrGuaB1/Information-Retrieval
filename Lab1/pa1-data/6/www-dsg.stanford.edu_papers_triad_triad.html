triad a scalable deployable nat based internet architecture next next introduction triad a scalable deployable nat based internet architecture david r cheriton mark gritter computer science department stanford university cheriton mgritter dsg stanford edu abstract network address translation nat has become an important technology in the internet supporting scalable addressing addressing autonomy concealed endpoint identity and transparent redirection however nat currently lacks a well specified scalable architecture and interferes with end to end security and reliability in this paper we present triad as a nat based architecture that solves these problems the key ideas of triad are i basing all identification on dns names not end to end addresses supported by a router integrated directory service ii providing end to end semantics with a name based transport level pseudo header and iii using a simple shim protocol on top of ipv4 to extend addressing across ipv4 realms localizing this extension to inter realm gateways we claim that triad solves the problems with nat is incrementally deployable and eliminates the need to make the painful transition to ipv6 triad a scalable deployable nat based internet architecture david r cheriton mark gritter computer science department stanford university cheriton mgritter dsg stanford edu introduction triad overview end to end semantics wrap transparent and opaque relaying multicast secure communication virtual private networks vpn policy based routing extended forwarding path check implementation and performance triad directory services security mobility name based routing implementation and evaluation wrapid gateways triad deployment advantages of triad related work future work concluding remarks references ipv6 deployment challenges and risks about this document mark geoffrey gritter wed mar 8 14 44 36 pst 2000
