ozonenews page 1 how to dry your microarray slides and keep your cy5 signal by robert marinelli this protocol is based on our good cheap kludge 1 ozone free room plans and the use of an eppendorf centrifuge model 5804 to dry microarray slides please see the ozone annihilator 2 for a detailed explanation of how ozone can destroy the cy5 dye our centrifuge is on a rolling cart about an hour before your washes make sure the centrifuge is in the ozone free room while you are there find the blueair purifying system with ozone catalyst and rotate the switch to max airflow 1 1 available at http cmgm stanford edu pbrown protocols ozonenewsvol1 pdf 2 available at http cmgm stanford edu pbrown protocols ozone_prevention pdf using our ozone free room you can now do your final wash and drying steps in a re laxed manner with no dan ger of losing cy5 signal due to ambi ent ozone ozonenews april 20 2007 page 2 verify that you feel air blowing out the front top and back of the air cleaner position air cleaner so it circu lates air around room as you leave the room be sure the door closes securely optional turn on teledyne ozone monitoring meter if it is in the room wash slides on bench as usual bring final wash bucket with slides submerged in wash solution and a set of matching balance slides if needed into ozone free room and place final wash bucket on bench turn on eppendorf 5804 centrifuge green power button lower left of front panel press blue open button on centri fuge lift cover press speed button until it shows a and a number when speed shows something like 70 that means 70 rcf which is the same as 70g if it does not show 70 then press speed until it shows something and then use the up and down arrows to make the number 70 note that you want the or you will be seeing rpm instead of rcf next press the time button press it a few times and you will notice that there are three indications for ramp up ramp down and time we are using a ramp up of 5 a ramp down of 5 and a duration of 5 minutes so press time a few times if any of the choices are not 5 use the up and down arrows so they are all set to 5 this gives you a ramp up of 5 a ramp down of 5 and a duration of 5 minutes next you have a choice you can load the centrifuge in place or you can lift the centrifuge buckets out and load them on the bench then transfer back into the centrifuge be sure the stain less trays are in each bucket to avoid spraying liquid in either case you will first fold some paper towels to fit each tray then when all is ready quickly transfer your slide rack from the final wash into the centrifuge bucket place in centrifuge be sure that you have good bal ance same racks same number of towels same number & position of slides close centrifuge press start button watch speed display it will start up and reach 70rcf in a while after 5 min it will slow down and it will beep when done after you hear the beep press the open button and carefully lift out ei ther the bucket slides or just your slides which ever you find easier place slides in a closed box and take them to your microarray scanner which should be in an ozone free en closure see the ozone annihilator please also turn off catalyst blower and centrifuge when all done 2
