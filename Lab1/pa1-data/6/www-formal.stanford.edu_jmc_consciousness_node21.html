humans and robots next up previous contents next a conjecture about human up making robots conscious previous non knowledge as failure humans and robots human consciousness is undoubtedly more complicated than the design we propose for robots but it isn t necessarily better the main complication i see is that human self observation like human vision is spotty i pursue the analogy because much more is accssible to observation and experiment with vision than with self observation subjectively a person feels that he has a visual field with everything in the field accessible with approximately equal resolution we also feel that colors are associated with points in the visual field in fact a person has a blind spot resolution is much better in the small fovea than elsewhere the perceived color of an object in the field has no simple relation to the light striking a corresponding point on the retina all this is because nature has evolved a vision system that finds out as much as possible about the world with very limited apparatus for example the usual objects have colors that can be recognized under varied lighting conditions as being the same color we have much less ability to observe human consciousness however it would be too good to be true if it consisted of a definite set of observable sentences a conjecture about human consciousness and its consequences for robots robots should not be equipped with human like emotions john mccarthy mon jul 15 13 06 22 pdt 2002
