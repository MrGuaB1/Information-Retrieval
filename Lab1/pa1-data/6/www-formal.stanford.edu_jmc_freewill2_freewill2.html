simple deterministic free will next next the informal theory simple deterministic free will john mccarthy from may 16 2002 until november 6 2005 abstract a common feature of free will is that a person has choices among alternative actions and chooses the action with the apparently most preferred consequences in a determinist theory the mechanism that makes the choice among the alternatives is determinist the sensation of free will comes from the fact that the mechanism that generates the choices uses a non determinist theory as a computational device and that the stage in which the choices have been identified is introspectable the present formalism is based on work in artificial intelligence ai we present a theory of simple deterministic free will sdfw in a deterministic world the theory splits the mechanism that determines action into two parts the first part computes possible actions and their consequences then the second part decides which action is most preferable and does it we formalize sdfw by two sentences in situation calculus a mathematical logical theory often used in ai the situation calculus formalization makes the notion of free will technical according to this notion almost no animal behavior exhibits free will because exercising free will involves considering the consequences of alternative actions a major advantage of our notion of free will is that whether an animal does have free will may be determinable by experiment some computer programs eg chess programs exhibit sdfw almost all do not at least sdfw seems to be required for effective chess performance and also for human level ai many features usually considered as properties of free will are omitted in sdfw that's what makes it simple the criterion for whether an entity uses sdfw is not behavioristic but is expressed in terms of the internal structure of the entity the informal theory situation calculus formulas for sdfw a generalization of sdfw knowledge of one's free will and wanting more or fewer choices philosophical issues praise and blame a possible experiment with apes comparison with dennett's ideas summary and remarks bibliography about this document next next the informal theory john mccarthy 2005 11 06
