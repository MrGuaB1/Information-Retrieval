vision & perception neuroscience lab stanford university home people research publications links photos internal our research utilizes functional imaging fmri computational techniques and behavioral methods to investigate visual object recognition and other high level visual processes for humans object recognition is a natural effortless skill that occurs within a few hundreds of milliseconds yet it is one of the least understood aspects of visual perception we are interested in investigating the underlying representations and cortical mechanisms that subserve recognition and the relation between these neural processes and our visual perception of the world object selective regions in the human brain here you can see visual areas in the human cortex that are selectively activated when people look at objects in the world and are involved in object recognition these regions include the lateral occipital complex that is located bilaterally extending ventrally into temporal cortex the images were acquired from mri scans in which we scanned both the brain's anatomic structure and functional activations current projects neural basis of face representation nick davidenko development of high level visual cortex golijeh golarai top down modulations of category learning rubi hammer temporal dynamics of face recognition corentin jacques spatiotemporal learning of novel objects moqian tian fine scale functional organization of face and limb selective regions in human high level visual cortex kevin weiner relationship between memory and perception nathan witthoft older projects prior knowledge and learning in object perception david remus figure ground segmentation joakim vinberg position and category effects in high level visual cortex rory sayres free page hit counter
