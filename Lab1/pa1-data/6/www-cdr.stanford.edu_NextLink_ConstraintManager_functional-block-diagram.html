constraint based system functional block diagram given constraints and preferences the system will perform constraint propagation to filter out inconsistent domain values then using predefined preferences the decision maker will make decisions continuously until consistent solution s is found with backtracking and consistency check their primary objective is design automation therefore the system should be tightly integrated to maximize efficiency however tight integration makes the system not so much useful for incremental revision support under dynamic constraints and preferences heecheol jeon jhc cdr stanford edu
