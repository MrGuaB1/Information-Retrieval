government bureaucracy and the parliamentary system back to index government bureaucracy and the parliamentary system john wonder writes i find the comparison of the spanish bureaucracy of philip ii and the present us bureaucracy ominous and i used to warn my classes about it i pity poor tom ridge and i don t quite know why he accepted the job how can he coordinate those agencies and whip them into shape without adequate authority it sounds impossible to me at least without the complete cooperation of congress which is very problematic have we reached the point where our whole government is in jeopardy because of bureaucratic clog and self interest i am afraid the answer is yes and i see no hope unless the people wake up which is also very problematic john the british have managed to keep their government in somewhat better shape is it the parliamentary system if so we should adopt it and do away with the mess my comment an interesting question perhaps larry diamond or someone can tell us if there is a study of the comparative efficiency of different regimes one problem is that us governments tend to solve problems by creating a new commission the great weakness of the us system is that money plays such a large rule in it how does that affect government efficiency ronald hilton 11 1 01 webmaster
