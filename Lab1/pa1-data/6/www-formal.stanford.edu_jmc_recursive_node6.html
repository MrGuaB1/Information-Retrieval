flowcharts and recursion next up previous next acknowledgments up recursive functions of symbolic previous another formalism for functions flowcharts and recursion since both the usual form of computer program and recursive function definitions are universal computationally it is interesting to display the relation between them the translation of recursive symbolic functions into computer programs was the subject of the rest of this report in this section we show how to go the other way at least in principle the state of the machine at any time during a computation is given by the values of a number of variables let these variables be combined into a vector consider a program block with one entrance and one exit it defines and is essentially defined by a certain function that takes one machine configuration into another that is has the form let us call the associated function of the program block now let a number of such blocks be combined into a program by decision elements that decide after each block is completed which block will be entered next nevertheless let the whole program still have one entrance and one exit figure 5 we give as an example the flowcart of figure 5 let us describe the function that gives the transformation of the vector between entrance and exit of the whole block we shall define it in conjunction with the functions s and t which give the transformations that undergoes between the points s and t respectively and the exit we have given a flowchart with a single entrance and a single exit it is easy to write down the recursive function that gives the transformation of the state vector from entrance to exit in terms of the corresponding functions for the computation blocks and the predicates of the branch in general we proceed as follows in figure 6 let be an n way branch point and let be the computations leading to branch points let be the function that transforms between and the exit of the chart and let be the corresponding functions for we then write figure 6 next up previous next acknowledgments up recursive functions of symbolic previous another formalism for functions john mccarthy 2006 08 13
