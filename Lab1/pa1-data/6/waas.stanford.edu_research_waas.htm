waas information from the stanford gps lab people publications resources jpals laas waas loran news home wide area differential gps wadgps the wide area differential gps wadgps laboratory is a subgroup of the gps laboratory at stanford university and is closely affiliated with the local area augmentation system lab our research focuses on gps navigation aids for aviation in all phases of flight we re located on campus so stop by durand 060 for a visit what is wide area augmentation late in 2003 the faa will declare the wide area augmentation system waas operational this system will monitor the gps constellation to provide differential corrections and more importantly a certified level of integrity the corrections will improve the accuracy of the system from ten or more meters to just one or two it is the integrity however that will open the doors for widespread aviation use although gps does have a strong track record it has not yet been generally approved for the most demanding of aviation applications gps was not designed for these applications and lacks the necessary real time monitoring previously aviation has had to use raim a technique exploiting redundant satellites to provide sufficient integrity this technique requires good geometry and wide margins as such it is suitable for en route flying and non precision approach however precision approach which brings airplanes within a few hundred feet of the ground has more stringent needs waas will enable aircraft to conduct varying levels of precision approach additionally the instrumentation required to use waas is substantially less expensive than today's suite of equipment although waas is not yet certified there is an operational test signal that is available for use and there already are several commercial waas capable receivers because it incorporates nearly all the elements of the final monitoring algorithms this experimental signal has a higher level of integrity than your typical differential system it is finding widespread use in agricultural and other applications more and more non aviation users are discovering the benefits of this free signal it offers the great advantage that the differential corrections come in the same antenna that the gps signals do there are no additional antennas to install no local reference stations to set up and no additional communication channels to maintain just turn it on and use it anywhere in the united states similar systems are also being developed in europe and japan over time the level of service is expected to improve in 2003 the first level of service lnav vnav will be offered for aviation instrument approach use in later phases better availability and lower decision heights will become possible current research areas ionospheric estimation signal integrity and availability antenna design backup navigation systems evil waveforms air traffic control applications highlights juneau ak flight testing 1 15 august 1998 creating the waas correction messag e waas nstb performance triangle charts scripts available gps clock sa anomaly top people publications resources jpals laas waas loran home copyright 2004 stanford university site design academic web pages site suggestions by the education online team
