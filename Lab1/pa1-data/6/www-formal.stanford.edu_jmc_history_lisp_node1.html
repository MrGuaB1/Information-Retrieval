introduction next up previous next lisp prehistory summer up history of lisp previous history of lisp introduction this paper concentrates on the development of the basic ideas and distinguishes two periods summer 1956 through summer 1958 when most of the key ideas were developed some of which were implemented in the fortran based flpl and fall 1958 through 1962 when the programming language was implemented and applied to problems of artificial intelligence after 1962 the development of lisp became multi stranded and different ideas were pursued in different places except where i give credit to someone else for an idea or decision i should be regarded as tentatively claiming credit for it or else regarding it as a consequence of previous decisions however i have made mistakes about such matters in the past and i have received very little response to requests for comments on drafts of this paper it is particularly easy to take as obvious a feature that cost someone else considerable thought long ago as the writing of this paper approaches its conclusion i have become aware of additional sources of information and additional areas of uncertainty as a programming language lisp is characterized by the following ideas computing with symbolic expressions rather than numbers representation of symbolic expressions and other information by list structure in the memory of a computer representation of information in external media mostly by multi level lists and sometimes by s expressions a small set of selector and constructor operations expressed as functions composition of functions as a tool for forming more complex functions the use of conditional expressions for getting branching into function definitions the recursive use of conditional expressions as a sufficient tool for building computable functions the use of expressions for naming functions the representation of lisp programs as lisp data the conditional expression interpretation of boolean connectives the lisp function eval that serves both as a formal definition of the language and as an interpreter and garbage collection as a means of handling the erasure problem lisp statements are also used as a command language when lisp is used in a time sharing environment some of these ideas were taken from other languages but most were new towards the end of the initial period it became clear that this combination of ideas made an elegant mathematical system as well as a practical programming language then mathematical neatness became a goal and led to pruning some features from the core of the language this was partly motivated by esthetic reasons and partly by the belief that it would be easier to devise techniques for proving programs correct if the semantics were compact and without exceptions the results of cartwright 1976 and cartwright and mccarthy 1978 which show that lisp programs can be interpreted as sentences and schemata of first order logic provide new confirmation of the original intuition that logical neatness would pay off next up previous next lisp prehistory summer up history of lisp previous history of lisp john mccarthy fri jul 26 22 37 29 pdt 1996
