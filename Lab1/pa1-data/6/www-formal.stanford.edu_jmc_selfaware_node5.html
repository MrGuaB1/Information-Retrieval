interrupts programming languages and self awarenes next up previous next formulas up machine self awareness previous machine self awareness interrupts programming languages and self awarenes consider a persistent program driving a car that is subject to observation and modification by a higher level program we mentioned the human example of noticing that cigarettes are wanted and available the higher level program must observe and modify the state of the driving program it seems that a clock interrupt activating the higher level program is all we need from the hardware we need considerably more from the software and from the programming languages a cursory glance at the interrupt handling facilities of c ada java and forth suggests that they are suitable for handling interrupts of high level processes by low level processes that buffer the transfer of information lisp and smalltalk can handle interrupts but have no standard facilities my opinion subject to correction is that self awareness of the kinds proposed in this note will require higher level programming language facilities whose nature may be presently unknown they will be implemented by the present machine language facilities however one feature of lisp that programs are data and their abstract syntax is directly represented is likely to be necessary for programs that examine themselves and their subprograms this feature of lisp hasn t been much used except in macros and has been abandoned in more recent programming languages in my opinion mistakenly next up previous next formulas up machine self awareness previous machine self awareness john mccarthy 2004 04 11
