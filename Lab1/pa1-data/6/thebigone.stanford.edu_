stephen quake's group stanford university home people papers news foundry contact links welcome to stephen quake's group at stanford university physics has a great tradition of precision measurement whose origin is widely credited to galileo the lesson that has been learned time and time again is that by measuring fundamental physical phenomena with increasing precision one can make amazing discoveries and even sometimes stumble across new laws of nature my research seeks to bring this tradition to biology we have pursued two main avenues of technology development in order to improve biological measurement techniques the first has been to develop the biological equivalent of the integrated circuit microfluidic large scale integration lsi we routinely fabricate chips with thousands of micromechanical valves each enabling exquisite control over its biological contents these devices allow us to take advantage of the unusual physics of fluids in small volumes which sometimes lend themselves to experiments which have no benchtop analogue the second technology avenue we have pursued for precision measurement is the development and application of ultra high throughput dna sequencing technology my work in single molecule biophysics led to the first demonstration of single molecule sequencing and my research in this field has led me to become deeply involved in human genetics immunology and the development of new clinical diagnostics applied physics bioengineering biological sciences bio x engineering medicine physics stanford university copyright 2005 stanford university all rights reserved
