profiling the x protocol profiling the x protocol john danskin and pat hanrahan abstract this paper describes a system for tracing the x window system protocol we have analyzed these traces by breaking the protocol down into discrete instructions or messages and analyzing the frequency and network resource requirements of these messages this analysis has resulted in preliminary results in 4 areas the relative importance of x messages how x usage changes during different application stages differing application idioms for accomplishing similar tasks and the size distributions of x messages and groups of x messages some of these results have architectural implications for network protocols and implementations additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper 664k back up to papers index
