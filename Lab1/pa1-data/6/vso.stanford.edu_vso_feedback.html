vso feedback help us improve vso if the current vso search interfaces aren t useful because of the way you search for data please let us know what we can do to improve our site please note all data provided is voluntary if would prefer not to answer some questions there is no need to we appreciate any and all feedback you are willing to give us email address only if you expect a reply how often do you search for new solar data almost constantly daily weekly rarely never how many different data sources do you search on a regular basis none one two three 4 6 7 10 more than 10 how would you describe your interest in vso i m a professional solar physicist i m a professional in a related field i m a student performing research i m interested in the data topology for a similar project i just like the pictures do you have a specific field of interest within solar physics please classify the following types of data in how important you believe it is to be able to use them to identify data sets of interest uses may include searching filtering sorting drilling down or other such operations as they are implemented in the future useless you see no reason in ever needing to use this data type unknown you don t know or don t care about uses for this data type maybe you can t think of immediate use but have a vague feeling that there might be slight you can see some occassional uses for this data type moderate you can think of reasons to use this data type on a regular basis very you would have a hard time describing data sets without this data type data type example useless unknown maybe slight moderate very observation time between 2004 01 01 and 2004 01 02 includes 2004 01 01 14 00 observation duration one hour or less more than 6 hours time series information cadence greater than than 60 seconds observation type intensity or line strength in situ spectral irradiance detector general location terrestrial spacecraft useless unknown maybe slight moderate very detector specific location soho big bear argentina detector or instrument name eit hxs mof 60 detector or instrument purpose observes interplanetary lyman alpha radiation collecting emission measures of hot plasma detector age all detectors commissioned in 2004 detector resolution better than 1 megapixel 128 channel counter useless unknown maybe slight moderate very observed area full disk corona specific sun location general spectral band high energy near visible radio specific spectral range infrared between 10 and 50 kev includes 60hz spectral sampling narrowband broadband helioseismic information useless unknown maybe slight moderate very global acoustic mode sampling known events within one hour of a cme people pi or observer is bob smith spatial sampling data format ascii fits jpeg graphs pictures useless unknown maybe slight moderate very data location gsfc sha noaa esa data size smaller than 10mb level of processing only level0 data data quality greater than 0.5 if you believe we are missing something please use the comment area below do you have any suggestions criticisms or other comments about the current vso privacy statement this policy establishes how we will use information we gather about you from your visit to our web site the privacy of our customers is of utmost importance to us if you read or download information we may collect and store information for statistical purposes for example we may count the number of visitors to the different sections of our site to help us make them more useful to visitors send us an e mail or comment by sending us a message you may be sending us personal information eg name address e mail address we may store the name and address of the requester in order to respond to the request or to otherwise resolve the subject matter of your message regardless of the information being transmitted to us we will protect all such information consistent with applicable law
