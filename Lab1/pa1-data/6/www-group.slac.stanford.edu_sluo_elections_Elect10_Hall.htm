jeter hall jeter hall i am a postdoc in the fermilab center for particle astrophysics my career has been focused on dark matter searches using both gamma ray telescopes and low background nuclear recoil detectors besides dark matter analysis my work is focused on instrumentation for these experiments i worked on trigger electronics for veritas and i am now managing the electronics and data acquisition for the supercdms snolab experiment i have just recently started collaborating with slac on the supercdms experiment slac is a new group but i have hopes that slac can help lead detector development bringing the unique skills of a national laboratory to bear on one of the most challenging aspects of the experiment as slac focuses more on applied physics i feel it is important that basic science both in particle physics and in astrophysics should remain a core part of the scientific program as a member of the sluo executive committee i will strive to communicate the importance of slac research to the public particle physics is typically a diverse field due to the international nature of the large accelerator and neutrino collaborations and i would try to maintain this diversity of culture through the transition that slac is making finally i believe my employment at fermilab is an opportunity to strengthen the connection between the two national laboratories in the parts of the scientific programs that overlap
