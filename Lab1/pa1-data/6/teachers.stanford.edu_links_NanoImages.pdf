nanoscale images page 1 nanoscale images all the images in these slides were created using scanning tunneling microscopes stms or atomic force microscopes afms these images are computer generated from measurements of electric current stm or electrostatic forces afm between the sample and the microscope tip these are not optical images atoms cannot be seen with visible light also the colors are computer generated to make the images more appealing page 2 images of atoms carbon atoms image is 1 nanometer wide page 3 images of atoms gold atoms image from dr michael green topometrix corpora on page 4 images of atoms manganese atoms on terraced copper and copper nitride image is 28 nm wide image originally created by ibm corpora on page 5 images of atoms carbon atoms in graphite pencil lead page 6 images of atoms cesium atoms on gallium arsenide page 7 images of crystals layers of silicon atoms in a crystal structure image prof max lagally university of wisconsin madison page 8 images of crystals sodium chloride nacl crystal structure image created by r carpick and r cannara univ of wisconsin madison and z wang rhk technology page 9 images of crystals sodium chloride nacl crystal structure page 10 images of crystals sodium chloride nacl crystal structure image is 3.9 nm wide image created by dr hj hug b s efel a moser pja van schendel o knauff s mar n and h j guntherodt university of basel page 11 images of atoms xenon atoms on nickel image originally created by ibm corpora on page 12 images of atoms carbon monoxide molecules on pla num image originally created by ibm corpora on page 13 images of atoms iron atoms on copper the kanji characters for atom literally original child image originally created by ibm corpora on page 14 images of atoms carbon buckyballs on a carbon surface the buckyballs were moved back and forth like the beads on an abacus click on the image for a movies of the abacus in ac on image originally created by ibm corpora on
