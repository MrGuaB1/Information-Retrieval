wavelet methods for radiance computations wavelet methods for radiance computations peter schroder and pat hanrahan eurographics workshop on rendering june 1994 abstract this paper describes a new algorithm to compute radiance in a synthetic environment motivated by the success of wavelet methods for radiosity computations we have applied multi wavelet bases to the computation of radiance in the presence of glossy reflectors we have implemented this algorithm and report on some experiments performed with it in particular we show that the convergence properties of basis functions with 1 4 vanishing moments are in accordance with theoretical predictions as in the case of wavelet radiosity we find higher order bases to have advantages however the cost scaling due to the higher dimensionality of the problem is such that the higher order bases only become competitive for very high precision requirements in practice we rarely go beyond piecewise linear functions additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper 430k figure 8 figure 9 left figure 9 right figure 10 figure 10 top left figure 10 top right back up to papers index
