lisa kaufman lisa kaufman university of maryland i am a post doctoral researcher at the university of maryland as a graduate student i worked on accelerator based experiments at both jefferson lab in virginia and slac currently i am based at slac working on the enriched xenon observatory exo which is an experiment to study neutrinoless double beta decay and is located in the underground facility wipp in new mexico this is certainly a time of change and great opportunity for many of us at slac as we shift from having a local accelerator based experiment as a focus of our particle physics community to one that utilizes the cosmic accelerators the world's newest and largest man made accelerator and underground laboratories this is a unique time in our field as the particle physics and astrophysics communities come together in our search for knowledge the slac user's organization sluo must serve the growing need of our community as we become more diverse in the types of experiments and theoretical approaches we pursue as a member of the sluo executive committee i would work to promote slac's scientific research goals with public outreach and outreach to our government this is a crucial time for scientists and especially the high energy physicists to reach out to the government and our community the funding and support of high energy physics in the us has been declining as we could feel in last year's budget cut and subsequent layoffs at slac it is now a more important time than ever for the physics community to reach out to the public to educate them about the importance of our current and future achievements this can be achieved through slac's public lecture series and with public tours of the slac lab the outreach to government is imperative as we welcome a new administration to the white house in the new year the physics community must be able to communicate to the administration the achievements needs and role the physical sciences play in the future of the united states i was able to participate in the 2007 sluo trip to washington dc in order to talk about the accomplishments and future goals of science to our legislators it was an enlightening and challenging experience the dialogue between scientists and their elected officials is necessary in order to continue the support of the physical sciences in the us this support comes about because of our ability to communicate the excitement interest and benefits that come from the research we do as physicists if elected i would continue to promote the science efforts at slac through outreach to our local community by continuing the public lecture series program and increased public tours i would also promote support for the physical sciences by the us government by continuing to communicate the importance of science to congress not only in times of urgency but at all times through letter writing and travel to our elected officials offices in washington dc
