sumo symposium the tensor maximum principle page 1 sumo symposium wednesday january 19 5 45 6 30 pm 380 380w the tensor maximum principle connor mooney abstract the maximum principle is a property of solutions to many differential equations that arise in mathematics and physics such as the heat equation roughly it states that the quantity of interest improves over time maximum principle arguments are central to study of geometric flows such as the ricci flow a heat type equation which tends to simplify geometric objects that may be complicated to begin with when working with in dimension three or greater standard maximum principle techniques are not enough we need a maximum principle for systems of equations ie a tensor maximum principle in the talk we will introduce the standard maximum principle and sketch a proof of the tensor maximum principle due to hamilton 1982 with a focus on applications to geometric flow problems
