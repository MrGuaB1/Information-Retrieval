sluo physics lectures supersymmetry physics lectures september 1996 february 1997 during 1996 and early 1997 sluo sponsored in cooperation with the nlc physics group a set of weekly lectures on supersymmetry for the slac experimental community the transparencies from these lectures are available at the sluodesk for you to copy introduction to supersymmetry michael peskin introduction and overview spin mass and helicity supersymmetric models with fermions and scalars more about models with fermions and scalars supersymmetric models with gauge fields the superparticle mass spectrum slepton pair production an illustrative supersymmetry reaction supersymmetry electroweak symmetry breaking and naturalness supersymmetry at colliders the minimal unified supersymmetric model james wells production and decay of supersymmetric particles scott thomas susy searches at e e colliders scott thomas supersymmetry searches at the tevatron and lhc james wells virtual effects of supersymmetry supersymmetry in b decays joanne hewett precision electroweak measurements and supersymmetry damien pierce supersymmetry at the nlc studies for snowmass 96 david wagner physics prospects for the nlc david wagner supersymmetry parameter determination susy parameter determination beyond the minimal framework jonathan feng susy measurements at the large hadron and next linear colliders a critical comparison jonathan feng the series has continued with the phenomenology of leptoquarks joanne hewett and tom rizzo we hope to have helen quinn start a series on cp violation in the summer of 1997
