content layer overhead next up previous next improved performance with inrp up implementation and analysis previous implementation and analysis content layer overhead we measured an overhead of 0.5 milliseconds total for both request and response for going through a single hop of the content routing layer on a name routing table of 5 million entries stored entirely in memory the 5 million names were randomly generated second level domain names with 80 in com and 10 in each of org and net a uniform distribution of name lengths between 3 and 17 was used these names were divided into aggregates of 15000 measurements done on the 1.7 million name database from our aggregation experiment show no significant difference in overhead profiling information shows that most of this time is spent doing packet processing measurements on the actual routing table show that route lookup takes as little as 6 microseconds our implementation can easily sustain a throughput of 650 requests second without any degradation of response time and peak throughput of 1600 requests second the total amount of memory used by the content router for a 5 million entry table was 344mb while that on a similarly generated 100000 entry but unaggregated table was 20mb this leads to an estimate of 69 bytes per routing table entry we can extrapolate that a 30 million entry database would require nearly 2gb of memory while large this is not an infeasible amount of dram costing only about $4000 it is worth noting that name lookups which must go to the dns root already encounter a database lookup of approximately this size mark geoffrey gritter fri jan 19 09 19 43 pst 2001
