induction in the situation calculus next up previous next formalizing oscillations up extensions of the formalism previous branching time and linear induction in the situation calculus several kinds of mathematical induction seem to be required for example one may want to prove a proposition by showing that it is true for s and is preserved by the events that occur between s and a related kind of induction is needed to prove that something is true for all situations arising in the operation of a buzzer the simplest case of the induction might be to show that a block unmoved by each of a sequence of events is in the same position in the simplest situation calculus is reiter's rei01 the formula is here are two formulas 47 is appropriate when is defined when is not defined as in the buzzer case we can use to mean that s is a distant successor of s and have the axiom john mccarthy fri feb 8 17 29 20 pst 2002
