linac coherent light source page 1 linac coherent light source the linac coherent light source at slac national accelerator laboratory is the world's most powerful x ray laser the lcls's highly focused beam which arrives in staccato bursts one tenth of a trillionth of a second long gives researchers the intensity needed to probe complex ultra small structures and the ultrafast pulses required to freeze atomic motions thus shedding light on the fundamental processes of chemistry drug development technology and life itself world's first hard x ray laser for nearly 50 years slac's linear accelerator has produced high energy electrons for cutting edge physics experiments now scientists continue this tradition of discovery by using the slac accelerator to drive the lcls producing pulses of x rays more than a billion times brighter than other x ray sources the ultrafast x ray pulses enable scien tists to observe matter and molecular interactions revolutionizing our view of the atomic world one snapshot at a time breakthrough innovation science magazine selected the lcls as of one of its top ten breakthrough innovations because it takes a qualitative stride far beyond its predecessors by providing exceed ingly bright x ray light driving applications in energy and environmental sciences drug development and materials engineering slac national accelerator laboratory menlo park ca operated by stanford university for the us dept of energy http lcls slac stanford edu lcls printed april 2011 general handout page 2 physics 31 materials sciences 24 chemistry 14 biological and life sciences 14 methods and instrumentation 9 high density science 5 optics 2 environmental sciences 1 users by field lcls facts 380 total lcls staff 359 scientists who conducted experiments in 2010 3 number of experimental stations in 2010 6 number of experimental stations by end of 2011 3346 operating hours in 2010 parsing proteins viewing the 3 d structures of proteins that generate energy for life and play key roles in disease is surprisingly difficult experiments with the lcls beam however will lop years off the time it takes to map proteins speeding our understanding of how these versatile molecules function in all living things viewing viruses the first images of an intact virus in its natural state were taken in late 2009 using the lcls's brilliant pulses of x ray light this work paves the way for similar portraits of microbes molecules and living cells studies that seek to expose the internal living struc ture of these biological entities harnessing nature's energy experiments at the lcls are studying parts of the photosynthetic system found in nature understanding how nature converts sunlight to energy could lead to the technology we need to safely and efficiently power the future upcoming lcls experiments will make the first atomic scale movies of molecules in action these movies will help scientists understand how a catalyst enables a chemical reaction allowing the design of more efficient catalysts for energy production and spur ring revolutionary new ways to make use of our energy resources the linac coherent light source is operated by stanford university for the us department of energy
