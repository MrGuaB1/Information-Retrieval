capillary surface interfaces the stanford university mathematical organization presents capillary surface interfaces a talk by professor robert finn the mathematical ideas underlying capillarity theory were introduced almost two centuries ago the elegant formal simplicity of the equations is deceptive and seeming experimental anomalies have led to questioning of their physical adequacy this talk will describe new studies that show discontinuous dependence of solutions on the boundary data symmetry breaking failure of existence under physical conditions and failure of uniqueness under conditions for which solutions exist some of the predictions have been verified in space experiments and the experimental confirmations offer convincing evidence in support of the physical correctness of the equations as originally formulated the predictions are suggestive for applications notably for fluid management under low gravity conditions professor finn has been a member of the stanford faculty since 1959 in addition to permanent positions he has held numerous visiting professorships in germany italy and taiwan he has also been a consultant to the european space agency for the design of space experiments and an investigator for nasa space shuttle experiments he was twice awarded the guggenheim award once in 1958 and another time in 1965 tuesday may 25 5 30 pm room 380 380c free pizza and drinks http www stanford edu group sumo sumo99 list lists stanford edu
