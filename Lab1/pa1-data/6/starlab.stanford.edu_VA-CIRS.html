cartilage interpolant response surface indentation testing is commonly used to test cartilage material properties using a bi phasic material model the determination of three material constants aggregate modulus poisson's ratio and permeability from the test results requires an optimization or curve fitting approach to determine a solution that best matches the experimental creep or stress relaxation sr data our group has developed a fast and easy way using matlab to calculate the best fit bi phasic constants based on input from a standardized indentation test this method involves creating a multi dimensional interpolant response surface map from a large number of solutions obtained from finite element analyses and then searching this surface map for the closest solution interpolant response surface maps were generated for a range of different testing conditions and saved as mat files these files are available for download below and we will continue to update this site as we produce more surface maps covering a wider range of experimental conditions instructions for running this matlab code are also here which contains more detailed documentation of the method instructions for running va squish va squish user guide pdf and all of the appropriate matlab files and routines can be downloaded from our project page on simtk
