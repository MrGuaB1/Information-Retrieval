cs348b final project proposal final project proposal kok wei koh xinru ng woo cs348b spring 2001 for our final project we would like to simulate an image of a ladybug on a flower here are two such images we chose this scene because we feel that images of nature are especially challenging to simulate while it is relatively simple to create plastic looking flowers making them look realistic and life like is another story the first challenge is to simulate the soft petals of the flower to achieve this we would like to implement subsurface scattering we will be looking at the paper reflection from layered surfaces due to subsurface scattering by hanrahan and krueger computer graphics proceedings annual conference series 1993 165 174 as the model for our implementation another challenge is the rendering of the yellow pollen of the flower we are looking at implementing texels to do this the following paper will be our main source of guidance rendering fur with three dimensional textures by kajiya and kay computer graphics 23 3 july 1989 271 280 the placement of some background plants beyond the focal plane of the camera depth of field effect will add to the realism of the scene finally if we have time we all a ladybug or two to our scene to simulate the textured surface of the ladybug's body we would like to implement bump mapping
