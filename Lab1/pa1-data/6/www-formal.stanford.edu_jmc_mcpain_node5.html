proof of theorem 1 next up previous next remarks up correctness of a compiler previous the compiler proof of theorem 1 the proof is accomplished by an induction on the expression e being compiled we prove it first for constants then for variables and then for sums on the induction hypothesis that it is true for the summands thus there are three cases i isconst e we have ii isvar e we have iii issum e in this case we first write using the relation between concatenating programs and composing the functions they represent now we introduce some notation let so that further let so that outcome compile and we want to prove that we have and now and next here we again use the induction hypothesis that s2 e is compiled correctly in order to apply it we need c loc map for each variable which is proved as follows now we can continue with finally this concludes the proof john mccarthy wed sep 29 13 40 01 pdt 1999
