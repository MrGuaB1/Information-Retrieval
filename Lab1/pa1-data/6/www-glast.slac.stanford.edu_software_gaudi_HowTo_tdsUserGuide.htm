users guide to the glast tds users guide to the glast tds purpose this document will describe what's available in the glast transient data store tds in addition to describing how to get data into and out of the tds what is the tds the gaudi transient data store is a mechanism to share data among multiple algorithms an algorithm may take as input any data that is currently available on the tds and then generate new data that is then stored on the tds for other algorithms to use consider it a shared memory mechanism similar in function to fortran common blocks what is available no data is always available in the glast tds what is in the tds is dependant upon what algorithms are run and what they do there is data that pertains to monte carlo raw detector data and reconstruction data here is a description of the glast event model used to define the structure of our tds how to get objects out dataobject pnode 0 sc eventsvc retrieveobject event calrecon pnode if sc isfailure sc eventsvc registerobject event calrecon new dataobject if sc isfailure log msg error could not create calrecon directory endreq return sc smartdataptr caladclogs m_calrawlogs eventsvc event calrecon caladclogs before you can get an object out of the tds you need to make sure that the tds subdirectory has been created putting objects into the tds when putting objects into the tds it's also important that the subdirectory has been created as above check to see if you can retrieve the sub directory and if not create a dummy data object and register it to the tds sc eventsvc registerobject event calrecon calreclogs m_calreclogs back to glast gaudi home back to glast software home h kelly last modified 2002 03 19 14 52 00 0800
