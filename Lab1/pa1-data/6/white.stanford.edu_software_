vista software vista logo vista software this code involves the work of many people from the wandell heeger and grill spector labs this code was developed as an undisciplined growth so it may contain little problems and is not always easy to follow although we use it every day and have great confidence in the core routines we are also familiar with its limitations we are constantly working on revisions and improvements and just plain bug fixes there is a lab wiki page that serves as a user guide also in some of the packages there is a readme file that describes some of the basic functionality of the software and brief installation notes unless otherwise noted all our code is released under the gpl the authors of the code retain all copyrights by downloading our code from the links below or from our cvs repository you agree to be bound by the terms of the gpl contents mrvista the main analysis tools are packaged as mrvista includes cvs modules mrloadret 3.0 mrdiffusion anatomy filters mrflatmesh and mralign mrdiffusion our diffusion imaging analysis and visualization package requires several components from mrvista thus this package is included in the entire vistasoft distribution itkgray our branch of the itksnap segmentation tool we ve added most of functionality from mrgray to this app and are using as a cross platform replacement for the aging mrgray which is a windows only app the windows version currently only runs under cygwin see the wiki page for installation instructions the linux version is compiled under 32 bit fedora core 4 but it runs well on most modern version of 32 bit and 64 bit linux we ve tested 64 bit fc8 and 32 and 64 bit ubuntu 7.10 it can be compiled under mac osx but we haven t had the time to set up the proper build environment for this if you d like to get the source code and try to build it under your favorite platform just contact bobd at stanford dot edu mrgray the mrgray windows application for white gray segmentation and 3 d viewing the mrgray source code is also available mrgraysrc zip you can also get a sample dataset for mrgray mrgray_sampledata zip note mrgray is being replaced by the new project itkgray vistadisp we have ported our experimental control code to run under the psychtoolbox on os x the new expttools2 and some sample applications are available in vistadisp software downloads the zip files below contain snapshots sometimes nightly of the software that we use in the vista labs note that some of the zip files below are compiled the moment that you download them this means that you are getting the most recent version of the software up to the second it also means that the download will take a few moments to start quench quench_macos_10_6 zip 2010 dec 07 5.6 mb quench_linux32 zip 2010 sep 28 6.46 mb quench_linux64 zip 2010 sep 28 5.28 mb quench_linux64_ubuntu_10_4 zip 2010 aug 29 7.04 mb quench_win32 zip 2010 sep 28 2.55 mb stimulus presentation vistadisp_hourly zip 2012 mar 17 237.53 mb vistasrc source code buildmesh zip 2008 aug 20 30.72 mb dtivis2_080902 zip 2008 sep 02 669 kb itkgraysrc_hourly zip 2012 mar 17 2.91 mb mrmeshsrc_hourly zip 2012 mar 17 52.1 mb quenchsrc_hourly zip 2012 mar 17 13.11 mb fmri and dti analysis mrdata_081129 zip 2008 nov 29 1.3 mb mrvista_hourly zip 2012 mar 17 148.92 mb itkgray itkgray_080128_fc4 tgz 2008 jan 29 6.35 mb itkgray_080128_win32 zip 2008 jan 28 6.73 mb itkgray_win32 zip 2009 mar 20 4.05 mb itkgray_080803_glx32 zip 2008 aug 03 6.72 mb itkgray_080803_glx64 zip 2008 aug 03 6.94 mb mrgray mrgray zip 2003 aug 07 532 kb mrgrayexamples zip 2006 may 08 17.68 mb mrgraysrc_2003 04 17 zip 2003 apr 17 3.92 mb quench doc data downloads for testing software quench_sampledata zip 2009 jun 23 29.7 mb mrdiffusion_sampledata zip 2009 jun 23 81.14 mb mrgray_sampledata zip 2008 dec 03 19.57 mb mrmesh zip 2010 mar 16 29.06 mb mrvistaanatomy zip 2007 may 13 6.81 mb mrvistaglmsession zip 2008 dec 03 151.6 mb mrvistaprfsession zip 2009 nov 19 689.9 mb mrvistasampledata_030421 zip 2008 dec 03 113.61 mb mrmviewermeshes zip 2008 aug 29 10.05 mb you can also browse the svn repository where we keep track of the software and modifications older code projects can be found in the cvs repository image systems engineering toolkit iset we have written a set of software tools matlab to simulate the encoding of light in cameras and the eye this iset software source included is available freely for 30 day evaluation this code is not available for cvs download
