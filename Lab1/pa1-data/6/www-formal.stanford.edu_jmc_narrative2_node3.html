non interacting events next up previous next detail of events up elaboration tolerant reasoning previous elaboration tolerant reasoning non interacting events allowing the addition of a description of a second phenomenon that doesn t interact with the first in this case the conclusions that can be drawn about the combined narrative are just the conjunction of the conclusions about the component narratives to infer the obvious consequences of events we need to assume that some other events do not occur in this paper a major novelty is that we do not assume that no other events occur we only state that there are no events that would cause an event in our narrative to fail thus a narrative about stacking blocks will state that the only block moving actions gif are those mentioned a block stacking narrative will not say that no traveling events occur nor will a narrative about traveling makes claims about what block stacking events happen this allows non interacting narratives to be consistently conjoined previous proposals could not conjoin two narratives as they either assumed that the events that happened were picked out by the result function or they assumed that the only events that occurred were those mentioned detail of events john mccarthy thu jul 8 18 10 07 pdt 1999
