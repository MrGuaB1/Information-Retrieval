iraq deaths under saddam hussein back to index iraq deaths under saddam hussein tom grey answers david crow's request the empirical basis for his statement on the number of dead under saddam hussein see http www gbn org articledisplayservlet srv aid 2400&msp 1242 here is an excerpt along with other human rights organizations the documental centre for human rights in iraq has compiled documentation on over 600000 civilian executions in iraq human rights watch reports that in one operation alone the anfal saddam killed 100000 kurdish iraqis another 500000 are estimated to have died in saddam's needless war with iran coldly taken as a daily average for the 24 years of saddam's reign these numbers give us a horrifying picture of between 70 and 125 civilian deaths per day for every one of saddam's 8000 odd days in power but such facts are not enough because for him the true question is whether civilians killed by the war are unnecessary i need to ask whether he thinks the civilian deaths were necessary or not i clearly believe they were necessary to oust saddam and save the lives he would have murdered to free the children from prison etc in fact more necessary than the atomic bombs to force japan's surrender if mr crow is willing to accept muslim fanatic terrorists with wmds or muslim theocracy rather than fight for western christian capitalist freedom then indeed comparing death rates doesn t mean much ronald hilton 4 25 03 webmaster
