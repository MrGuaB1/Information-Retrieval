function magnitude in theory physical quantities function magnitude defined in theory physical quantities source code physical quantities lisp slots on this function documentation the magnitude of a constant quantity is a numeric value for the quantity given in terms of some unit of measure for example the magnitude of the quantity 2 kilometers in the unit of measure meter is the real number 2000 the unit of measure and quantity must be of the same physical dimension and the resulting value is a dimensionless quantity the type of the resulting quantity is dependent on the type of the original quantity the magnitude of a scalar quantity is a real number and the magnitude of a vector quantity is a numeric vector in general then the magnitude function converts a quantity with dimension into a normal mathematical object units of measure are scalar quantities and magnitude is defined in terms of scalar multiplication the magnitude of a quantity in a given unit times that unit is equal to the original quantity this holds for all kinds of tensors including real numbers and vectors for scalar quantities one can think of the magnitude as the ratio of a quantity to the unit quantity see the definition of the multiplication operator for the various sorts of quantities the properties of that hold for all physical quantities are defined in this theory there is no magnitude for a function quantity instead the value of a function quantity on some input is a quantity which may in turn be a constant quantity for which the magnitude function is defined see the definition of value at arity 3 axioms nth domain magnitude 3 dimensionless quantity nth domain magnitude 2 unit of measure nth domain magnitude 1 constant quantity forall q unit mag and constant quantity q unit of measure unit dimensionless quantity mag defined mag q magnitude mag q unit mag magnitude q unit magnitude q unit mag and constant quantity q unit of measure unit dimensionless quantity mag compatible quantities q unit defined mag unit mag unit q notes example height fred 2 yards magnitude height fred feet 6
