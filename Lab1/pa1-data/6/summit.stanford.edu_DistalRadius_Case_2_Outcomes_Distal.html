title goes here outcomes research distal radius instruments several studies have demonstrated that degenerative changes on radiographs have little correlation with patient functional outcome to date none of the disease specific instruments have been validated for distal radius fractures the lack of this validation step should not discourage the accumulation of data since the charge is upon us to prove the efficacy of our treatment to outside agencies and carriers several centers are accumulating large series of dash outcome scores for distal radius fractures how the dash will compare with traditional objective scores short on the comprehensive and prospective end will be a fascinating study dash disability of the arm shoulder and hand the dash outcome instrument includes twelve questions culled from the sf 36 general health questionnaire a validated and sensitive instrument to accompany the functional portion of the dash it is the shared property of the institute for work & health and the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons aaos for specific information and permission to use the dash visit http www iwh on ca pages research dash htm view the dash instrument in pdf format requires adobe acrobat reader dash collection of this additional data will allow further comparative testing between measures of general health and functional limitations collection of data concerning general health is important to define and control for confounding medical issues as well as anxiety depression and motivational factors recently a shorter patient questionnaire has been introduced the michigan hand questionnaire mhq its 37 questions incorporate aspects of known tests to evaluate patient's function adls pain work performance aesthetics and satisfaction shown to be a both reliable and valid test from one site it may prove useful in our quest for better evaluation of distal radius fractures page 49 of 50
