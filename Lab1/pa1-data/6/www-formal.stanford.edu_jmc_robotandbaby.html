the robot and the baby 24 oct 2006 the robot and the baby this is the first science fiction story i have put up for the public to look at while it was written just as a story it partly illustrates my opinions about what household robots should be like in my article making robots conscious of their mental states i argued that robots should not be programmed to have emotions or to behave so as to have emotion ascribed to them cindy mason in her emotional machines home page expresses a different point of view the movie ai illustrates one disadvantage of having robots with emotions or which elicit human emotions unless you make them really human they will not fit into human society better just make them suitable as a kind of tool there is no more of the science of ai in the movie than there is in the pinochio story of more than 100 years ago one should also not take seriously any of the ideas of the movie of what robots might really be like household robots are still several scientific discoveries away those who predict their arrival by some definite date are just speculating the story also illustrates some mildly cynical opinions about how near future institutions might react to the events of the story there are html dvi postscript and pdf versions of this story up to my john mccarthy's main page send comments to turn on javascript to see the email address i sometimes make changes suggested in them john mccarthy
