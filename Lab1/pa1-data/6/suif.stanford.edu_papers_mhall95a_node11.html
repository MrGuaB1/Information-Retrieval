selective procedure cloning next up previous next interprocedural framework up interprocedural analysis issues previous region based flow sensitive analysis selective procedure cloning with the region based analysis approach described above precision may still be lost as compared to full inlining in the second pass when deriving the calling context for a procedure the analysis must represent the conservative approximation of information contributed by all program paths to the procedure such approximations can affect the precision of analysis if a procedure is invoked along paths that contribute very different information to avoid this loss of precision we incorporate into the calling context analysis a technique called selective procedure cloning where the compiler replicates analysis results for a procedure to determine its data flow information along paths in the program that contribute significantly different calling contexts 5 because the replication is done selectively according to the unique data flow information it exposes we manage the analysis costs and can usually obtain the same precision as full inlining saman amarasinghe fri sep 15 09 15 06 pdt 1995
