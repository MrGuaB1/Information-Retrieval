fast algorithms for volume ray tracing fast algorithms for volume ray tracing john danskin and pat hanrahan abstract we examine various simple algorithms that exploit homogeneity and accumultaed opacity for tracing rays through shaded volumes most of these methods have error criteria which allow them to trade quality for speed the time vs quality tradeoff for these adaptive methods is compared to fixed step multiresolution methods these methods are also useful for general light transport in volumes additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper 664k back up to papers index
