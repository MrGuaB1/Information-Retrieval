hi robert hi robert i tested a long treq and multi tack situation for gtrc 7 fpga with a command sequence illustrated below i sent three tack signals during one treq high with a duration of 10000 clock cycles 500 us and a tack signal at the treq falling edge clk 0 1000 10000 treq __ _______ tack ____ ___________ _______ ________________________ ______ 1st 2nd 3rd 4th token______ _______________________ ______ _____________ ____ 1st 2nd 3rd 4th i received data like following 1st data correct hit strip data with tot 1000 2nd data correct hit strip data with tot 2044 0x11111111100 3rd data correct hit strip data with tot 2044 4th data correct hit strip data with tot 0 the tot value of 2044 looks something like error code the response time for every token signal was less than 1000 clock cycle that should be correct behavior i also tried all possible patterns of event tag number and checked that the response does not depend on the event tag number please ask me if you have any questions mutsumi
