csif courses intro to confocal intro to deconvolution intro to electron microscopy photoshop note courses are not currently offered but we are working on it however individual training can be arranged by following the arrange training link on the microscopy cores main page individual training is required to use any csif microscope system regardless of experience introduction to confocal microscopy next course date tba target audience investigators who have fluorescently tagged samples that are difficult to interpret using standard fluorescent microscopy techniques confocal microscopy allows the visualization of fluorescent markers at high resolution in a single optical plane of a sample while rejecting out of focus fluorescence that lies above or below the plane of interest without requiring physical sectioning of the material this enables investigators to more exactly determine the location of specific proteins or other tagged molecules within cells as well as more precisely determine whether a set of proteins are colocalized topics covered what samples can be examined is confocal better than standard fluorescence for your sample what do you need to do before using the confocal microscope how to choose the best fluorophore s and prepare samples what kind of analysis can you do on the data how can data files be turned into publishable pictures introduction to deconvolution next course date tba target audience investigators who have fluorescently tagged samples that are difficult to interpret using standard fluorescent microscopy techniques wide field deconvolution microscopy allows the visualization of fluorescent markers at high resolution in a single optical plane of a sample while rejecting out of focus fluorescence that lies above or below the plane of interest without requiring physical sectioning of the material this is an alternative technology to confocal this technology also enables investigators to more exactly determine the location of specific proteins or other tagged molecules within cells as well as more precisely determine whether a set of proteins are colocalized topics covered what samples can be examined what are the specifications of the microscope what is the deconvolution algorithm how to best prepare samples introduction to electron microscopy next course date tba target audience researchers wanting an introduction to the basics of electron microscope image formation and capture photoshop from images to figures next course date tba target audience anyone working with digital image data files photoshop is one of the most powerful graphics packages available on the market the program is available for macs and ibms photoshop can be used to import files from many sources and then to manipulate them as desired images can be cropped adjusted for light color be labelled with text etc almost all of image collection is now done digitally and the ability to use a graphics package is essential training for all scientists topics covered importing images across the network understanding file formats tiff jpeg photoshop pict how to use channels and layers how to do biological image manipulation cropping image size brightness printing to the csif phaser 440 dye sublimation printer
