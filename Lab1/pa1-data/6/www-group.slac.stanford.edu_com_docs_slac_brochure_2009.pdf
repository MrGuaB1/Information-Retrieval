untitled page 1 page 2 the laboratory slac national accelerator laboratory is home to a two mile linear accelerator the longest in the world originally a particle physics research center slac is now a multi program laboratory for photon science astrophysics and accelerator and particle physics research six scientists have been awarded the nobel prize for work carried out at slac and the future of the laboratory promises to be just as extraordinary page 3 accelerator physics particle accelerators are the working engines of much of slac's research advances in accelerator technology at slac will create the tools needed for the next generation of science research in elementary particle physics x ray science and biological and medical studies astrophysics and cosmology slac scientists look to the skies and conduct experiments deep under ground to understand the history and evolution of the universe reveal the mysteries of cosmic objects and search for new fundamental laws of nature elementary particle physics slac scientists study high energy particles to answer fundamental questions about the most basic constituents of matter and the forces between them materials and nanoscience strength flexibility heat resistance and other properties of materials de pend on their nanoscale structures understanding the nanoscale will allow slac researchers to create more useful materials for myriad applications research programs slac's research programs explore the structure and dynamics of matter and the properties of energy space and time at the smallest and largest scales in the fastest processes and at the highest energies through our investigations into how matter behaves on multiple time length and energy scales we address major scientific and technological challenges affecting society at large molecular environmental science researchers at slac are seeking cleaner greener technologies through a better understanding of environmentally important molecular processes structural biology discovering the shapes and structures of basic biological components such as proteins provides a path to understanding how biology works on the molecular level leading to improved pharmaceuticals and other applications ultrafast science by capturing the ultrafast processes of atoms and molecules researchers at slac will better understand the dynamics of matter with a view to controlling the nanoscale in new useful ways page 4 a successful partnership great lab great university great science the 430 acre campus of the slac national accelerator laboratory is located in silicon valley 30 miles southeast of san francisco california on the stanford university campus the success of the lab's research program is a reflection of slac's role as a us department of energy national labora tory and its increasingly close collaboration with its operating institution stanford university institutes jointly located at slac and stanford enable the exceptional scientific vision that characterizes both institutions for more information about slac please visit www slac stanford edu
