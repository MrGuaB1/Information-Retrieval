root and pdr 2001 root and pdr 2001 introduction pdr home pdr faq output ntuple contents reading the ntuple running merit recon tree file reconrootdata reading the recon file root macros rootanalysis root class definitions introduction we will be using root for both i o and analysis for the pdr root i o has now been integrated into our gaudi framework allowing the result of simulations to be output into root files output the root output from pdrapp consists of 2 files 1 root ntuple containing the ntuple elements that were in use during the ao 2 root recon tree file containing more detailed reconstruction data as was available during the 1999 2000 slac test beam root ntuple contents of the root ntuple here is a description of the current contents of the root ntuple reading the root ntuple within root here is a simple example an introduction to accessing the root ntuple a new root macro has been created called ntupleanalysis this macro is designed so that users can customize the macro to apply their own cuts on the ntuple data running merit on the root ntuple merit is a program that we used during the ao to analyze the ascii ntuples producing text output that summarizes the result of applying standard cuts on the output data as well as calculating a psf and the effective area for the run for an example of how to run merit please see the pdr faq root recon tree file this root file has the same structure as was used for the 1999 2000 slac test beam with the addition of a run number being stored with each event the structure is determined by the reconrootdata package which contains the root classes used to fill the recon root file
