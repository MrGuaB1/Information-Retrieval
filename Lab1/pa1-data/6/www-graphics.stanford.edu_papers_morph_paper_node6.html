volume acquisition next up previous next warping up feature based volume metamorphosis previous prior work volume acquisition volume data may be acquired in several ways the most common of which are listed below scanned volumes some scanning technologies such as computerized tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri generate volume data figures 5a and 5c show ct scans of a human and an orangutan head respectively scan converted geometric models a geometric model can be voxelized 10 preferably with antialiasing 20 generating a volume based representation of the model figures 6a 6b 7a and 7b show examples of scan converted volumes interactive sculpting interactive modeling or sculpting 19 7 can generate volume data directly procedural definition hypertexture volumes 15 can be defined procedurally by functions over 3d space last update 11 may 1995 by apostolos toli lerios tolis cs stanford edu
