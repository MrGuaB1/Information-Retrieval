slac national accelerator lab the exo group in the particle physics and astrophysics directorate of slac is seeking applications for a research associate to work on the enriched xenon observatory a campaign to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in xenon enriched in the isotope 136 we are currently operating exo 200 a liquid phase tpc employing 200 kg of enriched xenon the next phase will be a tonne scale detector with an effective neutrino mass sensitivity of order 10 mev our group is deeply involved in the data analysis of the current experiment and in the r&d for the tonne scale detector particular efforts are in techniques for extracting the daughter ba ion from liquid xenon electronics development aimed at electronics in xenon and conceptual design of the full detector the ideal candidate would have broad experimental experience including knowledge relevant to low background experiments additional information on exo is available at www project slac stanford edu exo applicants should send a curriculum vitae a selected bibliography that highlights personal contributions a brief statement of research interests to raadmin slac stanford edu candidates should also ask at least three senior physicists who know their work to provide letters of recommendation please e mail your materials in electronic form pdf and at the same time ask your referees to e mail their letters to raadmin slac stanford edu evaluation of applications will start on january 31 2012 the position will be opened until filled slac is an equal opportunity employer additional information on exo is available at www project slac stanford edu exo
