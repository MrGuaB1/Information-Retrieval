uterus description the uterus is a flattened pear shaped hollow organ comprised of smooth muscle in the middle of the pelvis usually extending acutely antero superior from the vaginal apex it lies between the shallow vesicouterine pouch anteriorly and the deep rectouterine pouch posteriorly it has three parts the cervix connecting with the vagina the body as the major central part and the fundus or upper part lying above the uterine tubes the tubes extend laterally from the upper cornual portion of the fundus adjacent to the tubes anteriorly round ligaments 3 4mm dia extend antero laterally to the inguinal canal through which they descend externaly to the pelvic cavity into the labia major the cervix and the vagina the portio of the cervix protrudes into the upper vagina creating a vaginal fornix that surrounds it and both can be visualized by direct vaginal examination anteriorly the bladder is loosely attached to the cervix and the vagina adjacent to the cervix laterally the transverse cervical cardinal ligament maintains the cervix as the most immobile portion of the organ postero laterally the sacrouterine ligaments condensations of endopelvic fascia attach to the cervix holding it in place posteriorly the flat v shaped cavity within the uterus is the endometrial cavity with the tubal ostea visible supero laterally and the cervical canal inferiorly the canal has crypts into which acinar glands emerge the circulation to the uterus is via the uterine a a branch of the hypogastric a that reaches the uterus at the junction of the body and cervix passing medially in the base of the broad ligament under the ureter to reach the uterus innervation is from inferior hypogastric plexus largely from the uterovaginal plexus in the broad ligament these autonomic fibers are primarily vasomotor with little parasympathetic input
