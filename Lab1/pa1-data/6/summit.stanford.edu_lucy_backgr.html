background background the world around us is filled with objects and structures that have 3 dimensions x y & z coordinates we say in geometric terms from a baby's earliest viewing of its mother's face and hands to a child's learning that the sun is a round celestial body in the sky all animals experience life in 3d viewing our own bodies and all humans in 3d is the most natural method learning the detailed structures of the body the study of human anatomy has always been done best using cadavers as compared with drawings even with those that are shadowed to give the perception of the third dimension surgeons must dissect and repair organs and tissues of the body and must perceive the structures in 3d for the best result this imperative led professor robert a chase surgeon anatomist at stanford university to seek using computer graphics for creating 3d images for learning human anatomy his electric cadaver was the first such effort the development of ct and mri technologies led in the 1970's to images of the body in many planes for viewing regions of clinical interest such images are used today for making 3d models useful in pre surgical planning but nearly a decade ago as these imaging methods were emerging the identity of organs and tissues visualized by them was uncertain this fact prompted professor chase to section the pelvic region of a female cadaver to confirm for his scientist colleague chris constantinou phd in the department of urology the anatomic arrangement of the pelvic floor muscles being visualized in mr images thereafter the slice images were used sparingly in anatomy discussion classes to elaborate the concept of 3d organ models that students were required to build in their minds from many sources of information the human female pelvis is a body region that challenges anatomists and surgeons to integrate an intricate set of structures into a conceptual 3d model for teaching gynecological surgery to medical students and resident physicians in gynecology and obstetrics professor wm leroy heinrichs could use cadavers for teaching normal anatomy but those with pathological anatomy were very scarce he was searching for improved teaching tools beyond the usual videotapes and diagrams of pathological organs muscles and supporting ligaments and fascias finding the underutilized slices in the division of anatomy and the skilled expertise of dr parvati dev and colleagues in summit stanford university medical media and information technologies was a bonanza professor heinrichs dedicated over a year of personal time to learn and make 3d models using emerging software made available by wm lorensen phd at general electric corporation this set of models he called lucy 2.0 the namesake of lucy the first hominid biped of over three millennia ago institute of human origins from the slices of the stanford visible female dr heinrichs created lucy 2.0 as the first digital female soon thereafter came the visible human male and female sponsored by the national library of medicine in bethesda maryland usa top of page
