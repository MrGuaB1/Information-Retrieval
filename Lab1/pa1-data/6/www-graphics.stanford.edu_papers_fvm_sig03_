finite volume methods finite volume methods for the simulation of skeletal muscle joseph teran stanford university silvia blemker stanford university victor ng thow hing honda r&d americas inc ronald fedkiw stanford university to appear in 2003 symposium for computer animation abstract since it relies on a geometrical rather than a variational framework many find the finite volume method fvm more intuitive than the finite element method fem we show that the fvm allows one to interpret the stress inside a tetrahedron as a simple multidimensional force pushing on each face moreover this interpretation leads to a heuristic method for calculating the force on each node which is as simple to implement and comprehend as masses and springs in the finite volume spirit we also present a geometric rather than interpolating function definition of strain we use the fvm and a quasi incompressible transversely isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model to simulate contracting muscle tissue b spline solids are used to model fiber directions and the muscle activation levels are derived from key frame animations paper pdf
