judaism and pork back to index judaism and pork ed jajko says i would contest the statement that the taboo against eating pork is disappearing among jews rh i know at least one jew who eats pork but that does not prove much the pig was first domesticated in china about 7000 bc and china is still the leading producer it came much later to the west the words pig and pork do not occur in the king james bible but there ae some references to swine eg matthew 2 30 there was an herd of many swine feeding so the demons besought him saying if thou cast us out permit us to go away into the herd of swine and he said unto them go and when they went into the herd of swine behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a step place into the sea and perished in the waters and they that kept them fled this passage implies that pigs were being bred as meat perhaps their keepers were not jews possibly the pharisees did not take to this newly arrived animal perhaps the jews did not cook pork enough got trichinosis and decided that pigs were unclean and that pork should not be eaten when did the christians start eating pork ronald hilton 6 22 03 webmaster
