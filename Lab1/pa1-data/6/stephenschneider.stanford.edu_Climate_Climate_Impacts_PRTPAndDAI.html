relationship between prtp and dai figure the modeled relationship between the prtp a factor determining the discount rate and the probability of dai in 2100 increasing the prtp and therefore the discount rate reduces the present value of future climate damages and increases the probability of dai x as indicated where x is the percentile from the dai cdf derivable from the adaptation of the ipcc reasons for concern figure the solid lines indicate the percentage of outcomes above the stated threshold for dai x for any given level of prtp or dai percentile threshold x at our median threshold dai 50 thicker black line the probability of dai 50 rises from near zero with a 0 prtp to 30 with a 3 prtp as originally specified in the dice model source mastrandrea and schneider 2004
