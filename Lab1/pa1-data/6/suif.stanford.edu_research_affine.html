the stanford suif compiler group affine transformations affine transformations for optimizing parallelism and locality an affine partitioning theory it is well known that many loop transformations can be used to improve parallelization as well as the memory subsystem performance for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems many transformations have been proposed in the past including unimodular transformations interchange skew and reversal fusion fission reindexing scaling and statement reordering we have developed a new transformation framework called affine partitioning that unifies all the above transformations affine partitioning based algorithms developed an algorithm that finds the optimal affine partitioning that maximizes the degree of parallelism while minimizing the degree of synchronization developed an algorithm that maximizes parallelism and minimizes communication between processors developed an algorithm that uses affine partitioning to improve the data locality of uniprocessor and multiprocessor programs introduced the concept of distributed blocking a generalization of blocking from perfect to arbitrary loop nestings developed an algorithm that integrates affine partitioning with blocking developed an algorithm that uses affine partitioning to maximize the opportunity of array contraction experimental results the affine partitioning algorithm has been prototyped in the suif2 compiler infrastructure data locality optimizations have shown to triple uniprocessor performance on some programs a combination of affine transformations to improve parallelization and locality has allowed a speed up of 20 times on a 32 processor which represents over a three fold improvement over the previously best results publications improving parallelism and data locality with affine partitioning aw lim ph d thesis stanford university computer science department september 2001 also available in gzip ed postscript format blocking and array contraction across arbitrarily nested loops using affine partitioning aw lim s w liao and ms lam proceedings of the acm sigplan symposium on principles and practice of parallel programming june 2001 cache optimizations with affine partitioning aw lim and ms lam proceedings of the tenth siam conference on parallel processing for scientific computing portsmouth virginia march 2001 an affine partitioning algorithm to maximize parallelism and minimize communication aw lim gi cheong and ms lam proceedings of the 13th acm sigarch international conference on supercomputing june 1999 maximizing parallelism and minimizing synchronization with affine partitions aw lim and ms lam parallel computing vol 24 issue 3 4 may 1998 pages 445 475 also available in pdf format maximizing parallelism and minimizing synchronization with affine transforms aw lim and ms lam conference record of the 24th annual acm sigplan sigact symposium on principles of programming languages january 1997 finding affine partitions that maximize parallelism and minimize synchronization aw lim and ms lam proceedings of the sixth workshop on compilers for parallel computers aachen germany december 1996 communication free parallelization via affine transformations aw lim and ms lam proceedings of the 7th workshop on languages and compilers for parallel computing august 1994
