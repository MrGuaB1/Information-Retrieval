religion and poverty back to index religion and poverty bienvenido macario the philippines sends me long and well documented pieces denouncing the corruption of the catholic church there he asks in the next wais conference may we have a session on religion entitled religion the root cause of poverty i just noticed that here and in the philippines the bigger the churches and cathedral the poorer the people i do not want to have anything to do with the god of these religions this viewpoint is typical of anti clericals throughout the hispanic world at the wais conference we are devoting most of the first day to a discussion of religion we mentioned religion as a cause of war it would be quite proper to bring up the question of religions and poverty i defend churches because they are for the people to whom they offer a quiet refuge for contemplation consolation and hope my grievance is historically against palaces i hate versailles and in the modern world against the spending on arms which may cause the world to blunder into another war ronald hilton 4 25 01 webmaster
