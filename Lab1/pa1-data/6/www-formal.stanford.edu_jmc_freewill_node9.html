a minimal example of introspective free will next up previous next representing more about an up formalism for introspective free previous formalism for introspective free a minimal example of introspective free will the following statement by suppes suppes 1994 provides a good excuse for beginning with a very simple example of introspective free will there are it seems to me two central principles that should govern our account of free will the first is that small causes can produce large effects the second is that random phenomena are maximally complex and it is complexity that is phenomenologically in many human actions that are not constrained but satisfy ordinary human notions of being free actions my emphasis i don t agree that complexity is essentially involved so here's a minimal example that expresses i can but i won t because the agent is reasoning about its own actions as is common in situation calculus formalization the agent is not explicitly represented making the agent explicit offers no difficulties if an action a is possible in a situation s then the situation result a s that results from performing the action is achievable if a situation result a s is achievable and every other situation that is achievable is less good then the action a should be done here means not so good as actions leading to situations inferior to what can be achieved won t be done this is reasonably close to formalizing it can but it won t except for not taking into account the distinction between but and and as truth functions but and and are equivalent uttering p but q is a different speech act from uttering p and q but this article is not the place to discuss the difference john mccarthy sun nov 21 23 39 43 pst 1999
