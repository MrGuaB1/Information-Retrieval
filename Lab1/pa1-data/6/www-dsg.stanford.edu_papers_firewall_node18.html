protocol design issues next up previous next tcp back channels up designing an academic previous user acceptance protocol design issues given current application protocol design we do not believe that it is possible to implement a pure request response firewall policy for example we cannot deploy request response filters for ftp rsh and other protocols that require back channel connections udp based services in general are also not filterable packet filters do not maintain state information about previous packets and without that state the filter cannot ascertain whether a given udp packet is a response to an outstanding request we address these protocol limitations in our currently deployed firewall by either dropping packets and causing application level failure or by providing application level gateways on bastion hosts we believe that in the medium term protocols will have to change to address problems like spoofing and connection hijacking as well as accommodate ipv6 we therefore examine what additional protocol changes would allow a realistic packet filter to implement a pure request response policy tcp back channels connectionless protocols multicast traffic sandeep singhal thu nov 30 01 58 58 pst 1995
