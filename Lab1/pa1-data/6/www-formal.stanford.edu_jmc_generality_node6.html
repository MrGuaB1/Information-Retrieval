reification next up previous next formalizing the notion of up generality in artificial intelligence previous nonmonotonicity reification reasoning about knowledge belief or goals requires extensions of the domain of objects reasoned about for example a program that does backward chaining on goals used them directly as sentences eg on block1 block2 ie the symbol on is used as a predicate constant of the language however a program that wants to say directly that on block1 block2 should be postponed until on block2 block3 has been achieved needs a sentence like precedes on block2 block3 on block1 block2 and if this is to be a sentence of first order logic then the symbol on must be taken as a function symbol and on block1 block2 regarded as an object in the first order language this process of making objects out of sentences and other entities is called reification it is necessary for expressive power but again leads to complications in reasoning it is discussed in mccarthy 1979 john mccarthy wed may 15 13 24 43 pdt 1996
