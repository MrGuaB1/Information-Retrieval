network integrated content routing next up previous next content lookup up an architecture for content previous the content routing problem network integrated content routing our approach to the content routing problem is to view it as literally a routing problem clients and users desire connectivity not to a particular server or ip address but to some piece of content specified by name typically a url replicated servers can be viewed as offering alternate routes to access that content as depicted in figure 2 that is the client can select the path through server 1 server 2 or server 3 to reach the content assuming each server is hosting the desired content thus it is the same multi path routing problem addressed in the current internet in routing to a host figure 2 content layer routing network integrated content routing provides support in the core of the internet to distribute maintain and make use of information about content reachability this is performed by routers which are extended to support naming these content routers crs act as both conventional ip routers and name servers and participate in both ip routing and name based routing this integration forms the basis of the content layer not every router need be a content router instead we expect firewalls gateways and bgp level routers to be augmented while the vast majority of routers are oblivious to the content layer content lookup name based routing benefits mark geoffrey gritter fri jan 19 09 19 43 pst 2001
