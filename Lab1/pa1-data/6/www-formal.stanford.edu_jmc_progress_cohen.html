facts from cohen up to energy faq up to sustainability faq facts from cohen and others how long will nuclear energy last these facts come from a 1983 article by bernard cohen nuclear energy assuming breeder reactors will last for several billion years ie as long as the sun is in a state to support life on earth here are the basic facts in 1983 uranium cost $40 per pound the known uranium reserves at that price would suffice for light water reactors for a few tens of years since then more rich uranium deposits have been discovered including a very big one in canada at $40 per pound uranium contributes about 0.2 cents per kwh to the cost of electricity electricity retails between 5 cents and 10 cents per kwh in the us breeder reactors use uranium more than 100 times as efficiently as the current light water reactors hence much more expensive uranium can be used at $1000 per pound uranium would contribute only 0.03 cents per kwh ie less than one percent of the cost of electricity at that price the fuel cost would correspond to gasoline priced at half a cent per gallon how much uranium is available at $1000 per pound there is plenty in the conway granites of new england and in shales in tennessee but cohen decided to concentrate on uranium extracted from seawater presumably in order to keep the calculations simple and certain cohen see the references in his article considers it certain that uranium can be extracted from seawater at less than $1000 per pound and considers $200 400 per pound the best estimate in terms of fuel cost per million btu he gives uranium at $400 per pound 1.1 cents coal $1.25 opec oil $5.70 natural gas $3 4 how much uranium is there in seawater seawater contains 3.3 x10 9 3.3 parts per billion of uranium so the 1.4 x10 18 tonne of seawater contains 4.6 x10 9 tonne of uranium all the world's electricity usage 650gwe could therefore be supplied by the uranium in seawater for 7 million years however rivers bring more uranium into the sea all the time in fact 3.2 x10 4 tonne per year cohen calculates that we could take 16000 tonne per year of uranium from seawater which would supply 25 times the world's present electricity usage and twice the world's present total energy consumption he argues that given the geological cycles of erosion subduction and uplift the supply would last for 5 billion years with a withdrawal rate of 6500 tonne per year the crust contains 6.5 x10 13 tonne of uranium he comments that lasting 5 billion years ie longer than the sun will support life on earth should cause uranium to be considered a renewable resource here's a japanese site discussing extracting uranium from seawater comments cohen neglects decay of the uranium since uranium has a half life of 4.46 billion years about half will have decayed by his postulated 5 billion years he didn t mention thorium also usable in breeders there is 4 times as much in the earth's crust as there is uranium there's less thorium in seawater than there is uranium he did mention fusion but remarks that it hasn t been developed yet he has certainly provided us plenty of time to develop it the main point to be derived from cohen's article is that energy is not a problem even in the very long run in particular energy intensive solutions to other human problems are entirely acceptable cohen's web site contains links to many of his articles he's a particular expert on radiation hazards his 1990 book the nuclear energy option is on the web page its chapter on solar energy is especially interesting in its description of the 1990 hopes for solar energy up to energy faq bernard cohen is professor emeritus of physics at pittsburgh university he is former president of the health physics society the main scientific society concerned with radiation safety he has written several books on nuclear energy several of cohen's papers are reproduced on russ paielli's nuclear page up to sustainability faq send comments to mccarthy stanford edu i sometimes make changes suggested in them john mccarthy the number of hits on this page since 1996 feb 12
