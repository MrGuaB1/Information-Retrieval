lws helioseismology workshop 2012 lws workshop local helioseismology data analysis modeling and comparisons tucson arizona march 27 30 2012 the goal of the workshop is to discuss recent advances and new problems in the exploration of the structure and dynamics of the solar interior the workshop will focus on the analysis of common helioseismology data sets and shared artificial simulation data on the verification and testing of local helioseismology results and on improving the data analysis and inversion methods the hmi instrument of nasa's solar dynamics observatory sdo mission is providing a large amount of high resolution helioseismic data which are complemented by the ground based gong helioseismology network two carrington rotations cr 2100 and cr 2104 and two active regions ar 11092 and 11093 have been selected for comparison in addition the workshop will focus on systematics b angle center to limb variation etc these systematics will have to be understood and taken into account in order to make progress with the evolution of active regions and large scale flows determined with local helioseismic techniques the third focus topic of the workshop is the analysis of artificial data for magnetic regions and deep interior which will help to validate helioseismic techniques new observational and theoretical approaches eg wave form tomography multi wave length helioseismology seismology of sunspots and emerging active regions physics of solar oscillations sunquakes etc will be also discussed at the workshop the workshop will be hosted by the gong team at the national solar observatory for further information about the workshop please contact rudi komm rkomm nso edu or alexander kosovichev sasha sun stanford edu deadline for registration and abstract submission march 1 2012 registration form http sun stanford edu lws2012 registration html abstract form http sun stanford edu lws2012 abstract html there is no registration fee domestic travel support will be available for qualified scientists if you are interested in obtaining financial support please submit an abstract and send a 1 page cv and a request letter to haruko makitani makitani stanford edu before 1 march 2012 air transport tucson international airport ground transport arizona stagecoach http www azstagecoach com hotels airport hotels many to choose from see map at http www flytucsonairport com includes media docs tia_vicinity_map_hotel_restaurant_aug2010 pdf area hotels distance from nso most hotels range between $119 to $150 government rate is $103 windmill suites st philips plaza 4250 n campbell 4 miles towneplace suites marriott williams centre 384 south williams blvd 5.3 miles four points by sheraton 1900 e speedway 76 miles sheraton tucson hotel & suites 5151 e grant road 5 miles radisson suites tucson 6555 e speedway blvd 5.72 miles comfort suites at sabino canyon 7007 e tanque verde 7.5 miles doubletree by hilton hotel tucson reid park 445 s alvernon way 3.51 miles lodge on the desert 306 n alvernon way 3.19 miles holiday inn express tucson mall 620 e wetmore road 4.56 miles parking parking is very limited at our location therefore you should plan to park at one of two university of arizona parking garages 1 second street garage or 2 cherry avenue garage fee is $8 per day if you have any questions about visitor parking at the ua please contact ua parking and transportation at 520 621 3710 click here for a campus parking map
