chromosome segregation the straight lab chromosome segregation and cell division members research publications software protocols microscopes fun links contact us chromosome segregation chromosome segregation we are studying the process of chromosome segregation in eukaryotic cells accurate chromosome segregation is critical to ensure that cells are duplicated without genome loss or damage chromosome segregation mechanisms are conserved from yeast cells to humans chromosomes are replicated during s phase and are then segregated by a microtubule spindle during mitosis we are interested in understanding how the chromosomes attach to the microtubule spindle during mitosis so that each daughter cell receives one and only one of each sister chromatid we study how the forces for chromosome segregation are generated within the mitotic spindle and along the length of the chromosome and the mechanisms cells use to detect and correct errors during mitosis click to go back to straight lab research 2011 the straight lab contact webmistress stanford university
