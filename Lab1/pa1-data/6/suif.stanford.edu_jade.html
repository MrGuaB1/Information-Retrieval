the jade parallel programming language the jade parallel programming language jade is a parallel programming language an extension to c for exploiting coarse grain concurrency in sequential imperative programs jade provides the convenience of a shared memory model by allowing any task to access shared objects transparently jade programmers augment their sequential programs with constructs that decompose the computation into tasks and declare how tasks access shared objects the jade implementation dynamically interprets this information to execute the program in parallel while preserving the sequential semantics if there is a data dependence between tasks tasks run in the same order as in the sequential execution the structure of parallelism produced by the jade program is a directed acyclic graph of tasks where the edges between tasks are the data dependence constraints because the constructs for declaring data accesses are executed dynamically this task graph can be dynamic and can therefore express data dependent concurrency available only at run time jade has been released as part of the sam distributed memory system publications on the jade programming language
