an example of doing the circumscription next up previous next simple abnormality theories up applications of circumscription previous the blocks world an example of doing the circumscription in order to keep the example short we will take into account only the following facts from the earlier section on flying their conjunction is taken as a ab flies this means that what entities satisfy ab and what entities satisfy flies are to be chosen so as to minimize which objects are birds and ostriches are parameters rather than variables ie what objects are birds is considered given we also need an axiom that asserts that the aspects are different here is a straightforward version that would be rather long were there more than three aspects we could include this axiom in a ab flies but as we shall see it won t matter whether we do because it contains neither ab nor flies the circumscription formula is then which spelled out becomes a ab flies is guaranteed to be true because it is part of what is assumed in our common sense database therefore 42 reduces to our objective is now to make suitable substitutions for and so that all the terms preceding the in 43 will be true and the right side will determine ab the axiom a ab flies will then determine flies ie we will know what the fliers are is easy because we need only apply wishful thinking we want the fliers to be just those birds that aren t ostriches therefore we put isn t really much more difficult but there is a notational problem we define which covers the cases we want to be abnormal appendix a contains a complete proof as accepted by jussi ketonen's 1984 interactive theorem prover ekl ekl uses the theory of types and therefore has no problem with the second order logic required by circumscription next up previous next simple abnormality theories up applications of circumscription previous the blocks world john mccarthy sat jun 1 13 54 22 pdt 1996
