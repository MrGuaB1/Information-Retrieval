class scalar quantity in theory scalar quantities class scalar quantity defined in theory scalar quantities source code scalar quantities lisp slots on this class documentation a scalar quantity is a constant quantity whose magnitude is a real number an important property of scalar quantities is that they form a field with respect to the addition and multiplication with proper subclass restrictions the class of scalar quantities forms a partial order with the less than relation since is a relation extended to quantities and is defined over the reals the relation is not a total order over the class of scalar quantity since elements from some subclasses such as length quantities are incomparable to elements from other subclasses such as mass quantities subclass of constant quantity partial order superclass of real number axioms scalar quantity q and constant quantity q forall u and unit of measure u compatible quantities u q real number magnitude q u
