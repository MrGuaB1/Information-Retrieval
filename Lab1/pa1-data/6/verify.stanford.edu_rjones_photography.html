robert b jones photography photography robert jones photography has been a hobby for me since high school i started with nikon manual focus equipment and print film my first slr was an fg i later moved to an f3hp upon the introduction of children into my life i found that my manual focus system had serious shortcomings in the right hands of course a manual focus camera with moving targets is not a problem for my hands i decided that i needed to switch to autofocus in mid 2000 i purchased a nikon f100 and started purchasing autofocus lenses i also started into digital photography with the acquisition of a film scanner after much frustration with dust and scratches i discovered the magic of digital ice and purchased a nikon coolscan iii as i learned more about photography i realized that i needed to start trying to use slide film scanning print film is tricky properly exposing slides is trickier in 2002 i purchased a nikon coolscan iv that was a significant step up from the coolscan iii the current model is the coolscan v i was getting better but found myself frustrated with the amount of time it took to properly scan a single frame of film in 2001 my wife and i discovered the instant gratification of digital photography with a kodak 4800 digicam in early 2003 i purchased my first digital slr the nikon d100 i ve never looked back while the d100 doesn t have the same autofocus performance and build quality as my f100 it takes fantastic photographs in fact i have not shot a single frame of film since the purchase of the d100 i still can t bring myself to part with my f100 but i m getting closer printers are another long story but i ll make it very brief after varying experiences with 3 different photo printers i settled on an epson 1270 the current model is the epson 1280 it produces incredible prints up to 13x19 my favorite paper is epson heavyweight matte but i use a lot of epson glossy photo paper because i can buy it on the cheap at costco e bay is a wonderful thing it's what has enabled me to try different cameras lenses scanners printers and in a couple of cases software if you buy equipment on e bay you can usually sell it for close to the same amount yes there is fraud and you have to be careful but so far i ve been fortunate to avoid any major problems if you are buying equipment new i recommend your local proshop or one of the reputable mail order houses i ve had good experiences with b&h photo and adorama digital photography requires specialized software the packages i have found most useful are qimage printing paint shop pro editing imatch database management and vuescan scanning all of these packages cost less than $100 have downloads for free trials and have large vibrant web based user communities the authors of qimage imatch and vuescan participate directly in the web forums paint shop pro and imatch both provide a full api for scripting python for psp and visual basic for imatch this is an incredibly useful feature that i use extensively below are a few of my favorite photographs i d like to put more on the web but 1 i need some time to create a real gallery and 2 i should find a place other than david dill's stanford machines to serve the pages from all photographs are copyright 1999 2004 robert b jones absolutely no reproduction or copying is permitted without prior consent orchids 2003 technical data nikon d100 nikkor 24 85mm f3 5 4.5 g afs gitzo tripod sunrise spofford lake new hampshire 2003 technical data nikon d100 nikkor 24 85mm f3 5 4.5 g afs banana frond at sunset sea of galilee israel 2003 technical data nikon d100 nikkor 70 180mm f4 5 5.6 afd moonrise mount of olives jerusalem 2003 technical data nikon d100 nikkor 12 24mm f4 0 dx g afs sunset louvre museum paris 2001 technical data nikon f100 nikkor 20 35mm f2 8 afd kodak supra 100 sunset arcadia state beach oregon 2001 technical data nikon f100 nikkor 20 35mm f2 8 afd fuji velvia 50 gitzo tripod leicester square london 1999 technical data nikon f3hp nikkor 50mm f1 4 fuji superia 400 clamp tripod on iron fence robert jones rjones ichips intel com last modified 20 january 2004
