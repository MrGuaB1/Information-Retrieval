glast likelihood calculations page 1 glast likelihood calculations my poster paper from the head meeting in honolulu november 2000 page 2 i wrote an 8 page paper about glast likelihood calculations a revision of a document that i worked on about a year ago it has lots of equations lots of opinions no graphs and a few soft numbers it's available on the net at httpd giants stanford edu pln glastlike paper pdf page 3 teaser at a workshop the night before i got to present a very brief talk with these points each photon event is complex the psf and energy dispersion vary with angle and type of event thus the instrument response functions are large multidimensional objects perhaps 100 gb total most observations will be in zenith scanning mode so the response to any point source is dynamic the wide fov means that there will always be many interesting sources in view the wide psf means that there will be a lot of source confusion any analysis requires fitting multiple sources and stitching together separate parts of the data stream chi squared can t be used for most sources because there are not many photons spread over too many bins in the observing space poisson likelihood must be used
