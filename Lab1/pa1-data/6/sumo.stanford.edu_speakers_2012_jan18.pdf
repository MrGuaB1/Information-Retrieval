the sumo speaker series for undergraduates poncelet's porism page 1 the sumo speaker series for undergraduates food provided wednesday january 18th 4 15 5 05 room 380c poncelet's porism arnav tripathy abstract consider a triangle whose vertices all lie on some large circle c and whose sides are all tangent to some smaller circle c then starting with any other point p on c one can find q and r also on c such that pq and pr are tangent to c we now have the amazing fact that qr is always tangent to c so that we get a whole family of triangles with the same circumscribed and inscribed circles i shall present a proof of this charming observation in purely synthetic euclidean geometry and if time permits a natural three dimensional analogue of course the proof given shall not be within purely synthetic euclidean geometry rather i hope to also provide a gentle introduction to some elementary but beautiful aspects of classical algebraic geometry sumo stanford edu speakers
