finite groups of matrices over infinite fields page 1 finite groups of matrices over infinite fields pizza provided wednesday december 7th 4 15 5 05 room 380c professor brian conrad abstract the collection of all rigid motions of space preserving the origin eg rotation around a line reflection through a plane is an example of a matrix group a non empty collection of matrices stable under composition and inversion the matrices that arise as rigid motions can be described by a simple explicit system of equations in the matrix entries and they form an infinite group but this infinite group contains interesting finite subgroups the determination of such finite groups is closely related to the classification of platonic solids after discussing some of that story we discuss how to use number theory to give an upper bound on the size of a finite subgroup of a group of matrices with rational entries and the optimality of such bounds sumo stanford edu speakers
