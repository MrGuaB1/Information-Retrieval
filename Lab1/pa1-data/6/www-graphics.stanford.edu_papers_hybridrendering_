realistic reflections and refractions on graphics hardware with hybrid rendering and layered environment maps realistic reflections and refractions on graphics hardware with hybrid rendering and layered environment maps ziyad s hakura and john m snyder to appear in the 12th eurographics workshop on rendering 2001 abstract we introduce hybrid rendering a scheme that dynamically ray traces the local geometry of reflective and refractive objects but approximates more distant geometry by hardware supported environment maps ems to limit computation we use a greedy ray path shading model that prunes the binary ray tree generated by refractive objects to form just two ray paths we also restrict ray queries to triangle vertices but perform adaptive tessellation to shoot additional rays where neighboring ray paths differ sufficiently by using layered parameterized ems that are inferred over a set of viewpoint samples to match ray traced imagery we accurately handle parallax and view dependent shading in the environment we increase robustness of ems by inferring them simultaneously across multiple viewpoints and including environmental geometry that is occluded from the viewpoint sample but is revealed in nearby viewpoints we demonstrate realistic shiny and glass objects with a user controlled viewpoint additional information available paper pdf 2mb this page copyright 2001 by ziyad hakura the paper copyright 2001 by springer verlag zsh graphics stanford edu
