projects dexterous manipulation laboratory robust event detection for dextrous manipulation the detection of events uses a combination of tactile sensors and context as shown in the figure below the context consists of information about the phase only certain kinds of events are feasible in each phase class and information about the commanded motions forces etc this information is combined to assess the probability that a particular event has occurred as explained following the figure features are derived from the sensor and context information and clustered in a feature space the example shown below is a two dimensional feature space various events are shown as subspaces event confidence functions are computed from the feature space clusters and used to determine i which events could be occuring and ii which event s probably have occured by definition a new phase begins as soon as an event is committed to and a new context information then applies as explained in the framework project description a prepatory action deceleration begins when a contact event confidence exceeds an alert threshold the contact phase begins when the contact event confidence exceeds a commitment threshold the following figure shows the results for several events during an object manipulation task in each case the real event is listed at the top of the plot the correct events are quickly identified althoug in some cases another event briefly exceeds an alert threshold details on the event detection scheme can be found in tremblay and cutkosky 1995 using sensor fusion and contextual information to perform event detection during a phase based manipulation task 1995 ieee rsj intl conference on intelligent robots and systems marc tremblay's phd thesis back to the dextrous manipulation lab home page or projects page marc tremblay and mark cutkosky may 1995 sub_heading sub_heading
