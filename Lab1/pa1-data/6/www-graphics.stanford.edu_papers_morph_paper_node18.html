octree subdivision next up previous next implementation up performance and optimization previous piecewise linear approximation octree subdivision usually contains large empty regions that is regions which are completely transparent the warp will map these parts of into empty regions of scan conversion as described above need not take place when a warped grid cell is wholly contained within such a region by constructing an octree over we can identify many such cells and thus avoid scan converting them last update 11 may 1995 by apostolos toli lerios tolis cs stanford edu
