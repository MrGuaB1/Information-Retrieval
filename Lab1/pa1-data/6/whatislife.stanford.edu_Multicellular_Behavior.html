multicellular behavior rosanna chau how do multicellular structures arise behavioral differences between cells are influenced by genetic and biochemical factors as well as by physical interactions both with other cells and with the external environment these processes mediate the organization and specialization of single cells in a community using the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp pcc6803 which exhibits phototaxis directed motion towards a light source we aim to further our understanding of motility across single and multicellular length scales the phototactic motility of synechocystis has been shown to depend on the intensity of light shining on it the wavelength of that light and also the complex polysaccharides secreted by other cells in cultures of synechocystis light induced motility can drive the creation of finger like projections that span over hundreds of microns with each projection containing a sub community of cyanobacteria with a minimal biophysical model we have succeeded in reproducing this finger like pattern in silico the formation of fingers is shown to be directly correlated with basic parameters such as polysaccharide concentration and initial cell density further studies will include the inclusion of more complex interactions into our biophysical model we are also developing an optical control tower to create an optically controlled and spatially structured platform for precise quantification of the wavelength spatial and time dependences of synechocystis phototaxis back to research main page 2 d cultures of synechocystis form finger like projections multicellular behavior the experimentally observed finger like projections are also realized in the simulations above kchuang lab 318 campus drive west clark center e372 stanford ca 94305
