the blocks world next up previous next nonmonotonic reasoning situation by situation up actions and other events previous two elaborations of the the blocks world assume enough unique names axioms the blocks world involves the frame problem in a more significant way than do the buzzer and the stuffy room scenarios we use the predicate prevents p e s to say that a move is prevented by there being a block on top of the block to be moved or on the destination unless the destination is the table we thereby skip the use of the fluent clear x prevalent in many blocks world sitcalc theories here's the effect axiom for moving a block and here are the axioms for prevention we adopt the usual way of emphasizing the frame problem by introducing the action of painting a block a certain color thus or using object valued ie non propositional fluents the change axioms for the blocks world are the nonmonotonic reasoning associated with the blocks world will be discussed after the section dealing with nonmonotonic reasoning in situation calculus in general john mccarthy fri feb 8 17 29 20 pst 2002
