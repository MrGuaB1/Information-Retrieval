region based analysis next up previous next phase 1 transfer up support for array previous representation symbolic maps region based analysis we obtain absolute value maps describing variable values at every program point in two passes as a region based data flow analysis a bottom up pass through the program derives the transfer function for each region as a relative value map that describes variable values at each immediate subregion in terms of entry variable values a subsequent top down pass through the program propagates to each region a symbolic context an absolute map describing actual variable values on region entry in terms of enclosing loop indices and invariants phase 1 transfer functions phase 2 symbolic calling contexts cloning saman amarasinghe mon oct 2 11 00 22 pdt 1995
