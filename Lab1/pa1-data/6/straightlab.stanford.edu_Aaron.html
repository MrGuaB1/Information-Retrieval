aaron straight ph d the straight lab chromosome segregation and cell division members research publications software protocols microscopes fun links contact us aaron straight ph d our work is directed at understanding the mechanisms that ensure high fidelity genome maintenance and segregation in eukaryotes we use a wide variety of experimental systems ranging from yeasts and flies to frogs and humans in order to address biophysical biochemical and cell biological questions in chromosome biology we are particularly interested in how cells accurately segregate chromosomes to daughter cells during mitosis and meiosis to produce viable daughters and gametes so that an organism can grow develop and proliferate our research has focused on understanding how the chromosomal centromere and kinetochore function to link the chromosomes to the mitotic spindle that segregates chromosomes during division we are also interested in how chromosomes are organized within the interphase nucleus and mitotic chromosome so that the genome can be actively transcribed replicated and segregated and yet accurately maintained and packaged within the nucleus and cell aaron's publications click here to go back to lab members page 2012 the straight lab contact webmistress stanford university
