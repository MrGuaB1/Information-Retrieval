the suif 1 x compiler software distribution the suif 1 x compiler system the suif stanford university intermediate format 1 x compiler developed by the stanford compiler group is a free infrastructure designed to support collaborative research in optimizing and parallelizing compilers table of contents overview of the suif compiler the suif software distribution the suif documentation suif related mailing lists contributions by other research groups research using suif at stanford and elsewhere overview of the suif compiler independently developed compilation passes work together by using a common intermediate format to represent programs the system includes the following components fortran and c front ends suif suif fortran and c data dependence analysis a basic parallelizer a loop level locality optimizer a visual suif code browser the suif software distribution suif 1.3 0.5 release this is a release of the suif1 retroactive bug fixes distribution 1.3 0.5 as you may know the suif group has moved its development effort on from suif1 to suif version 2 some of you may have obtained the basesuif 2.0 0 alpha 38 release which contained a version of suif1 modified to work in concert with an early release of suif2 various symbols were renamed suif1_ to not conflict with the same name in suif2 since the naming scheme has changed in more recent suif2 code this conflict is no longer a problem we undid the name changes so that the only name changes visible to the user should be libsuif1 and suif1 h this release should work with the new release of suif2 conversion passes are already working see the suif 1x web pages for more documentation we have incorporated all the bug fixes people sent us about 1.3 0 1 4 plus a few more please let us know if you find more problems if it is a machine configuration problem please try to figure out some patches yourself since we don t have a lot of time to polish this more thanks basesuif package basesuif 1.3 0.5 the base suif system required before any of the other packages can be used it untars itself into a directory called suifhome other packages these should be untarred in the directory suifhome src suifbuilder 1.3 0.5 a library built on top of suif providing another interface for building suif code requires basesuif baseparsuif 1.3 0.5 the basic suif parallelization system requires basesuif and suifbuilder fortback 1.3 0.5 a suif to fortran converter to convert to a combination of fortran and c to improve performance over conversion to c alone requires basesuif suifcallgraph 1.3 0.5 a call graph library for suif requires baseparsuif and basesuif suifvbrowser 1.3 0.5 the suif visual browser a graphical user interface to view suif files and their relations to input and output source code requires suifcallgraph baseparsuif and basesuif and also requires tcl tk a pair of packages that are available independently of suif suifcookbook 1.3 0.5 an introduction to construction of suif passes in cookbook form going through several examples requires basesuif suifbuilder and baseparsuif simplesuif 1.3 0.5 a simplified interface for suif for teaching compiler courses requires basesuif most likely broken since this was tied to the suif2 0.0 alpha 38 suif1_ renaming and hasn t been tested recently suifps 1.3 0.5 suif to postscript support verisuif 1.3 0.5 verilog transformations built on suif an earlier post mortem package please mail bugs and or fixes to suif talk suif stanford edu for discussion and review by those still using suif 1 click here to see who wrote what the suif documentation an overview of the suif system suif parallelizing compiler guide how to compile and run parallel programs with suif the suif cookbook a guide to creating suif passes a series of examples the suif library a set of core routines for manipulating suif data structures the builder library a tool to construct or modify suif code within the suif compiler the suifmath library a set of routines for the manipulation of matrices and linear inequalities the dependence library a set of routines for analyzing dependences between array references the transform library a set of general loop transformation routines the simple suif compiler guide a simple interface to suif for compiler courses the suif man pages suif related mailing lists information on the suif mailing lists can be found here contributions by other research groups harvard hube research group machsuif a suif subsystem to support machine dependent optimization branch instrumentation in suif university of toronto compiler group a sparc code generator uc berkeley brass research group the tcovsuif profiling system for suif on sparc workstations los alamos national laboratory reconfigurable computing group streams c stream oriented c programming for fpgas research using suif at stanford and elsewhere proceedings of the suif compiler workshops web pages of research groups using suif
