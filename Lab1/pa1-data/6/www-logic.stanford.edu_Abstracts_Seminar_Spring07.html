mathematical logic seminar mathematical logic seminar abstracts spring 2007 douglas bridges university of canterbury constructive aspects of gleason's theorem and unbounded operators following a brief outline of the contrast between classical mathematics and constructive mathematics mathematics with intuitionistic logic i sketch richman's proof of gleason's theorem i then discuss the first main theorem of pour el and richards in particular i focus on the wild claim that the first main theorem establishes the impossibility of a constructive theory of unbounded operators patrick girard stanford university mathematics behind ceteris paribus preference logic the modal logic for ceteris paribus preference logic raises interesting mathematical questions in this talk we first discuss the completeness of baisc and ceteris paribus logic we then take a more general standpoint and investigate how ceteris paribus logic is related to basic and infinitary modal logic we finally investigate its expressive power and compare it to pdl and the mu calculus tomohiro hoshi stanford university parameterization of monadic constraints a logical formula f x p can be treated as an equation to be satisfied by the solutions x_0 p with the expressions p as parameters for the expression x if there is such solutions in parameterizing models of propositional calculus formulas j mccarthy takes up this problem from a slightly different angle ie the parameterization of the models of formulas and gives the general solutions in propositional logic he suggests a further investigation on the parameterization problem for other logics in this talk i will investigate the general solutions for the formulas in monadic first order predicate logic
