svc example formulas examples the following are examples of svc formulas shostak function ineq array record bitvec shostak the example below is from shostak's 1984 paper titled an algorithm for reasoning about equality the formula has been converted into scv syntax or z f x 1 y x zy y x 1 f fz function congruence closure is required in order to determine the validity of this formula ite and f f f f fx x f f fx x fx x true ineq this examples uses intrepreted linear arithmetic and linear inequalities the variables are defined as common sub expressions and are subsequently referred to by their expression number true or not 4 3 $450 v450 4 3 $451 v451 $452 v452 or 2 $453 v453 2 3 $453 $454 v454 or not $452 $454 not $453 $450 $451 array this is an example that requires reasoning about unbounded arrays the read and write expressions are interpreted write s1 a1 v1 write s2 a2 v2 and b a1 b a2 read s1 b read s2 b record this is an example that uses records recupdate record a rat b rat r b 1 record a recselect r a b 1 bitvec this is an example that uses bit vectors bitcat bitsel bitplus bitvec 32 bv3 bitvec 32 bv2 31 16 bitsel bitplus bitvec 32 bv3 bitvec 32 bv2 15 0 bitplus bv3 bv2 svc verify stanford edu
