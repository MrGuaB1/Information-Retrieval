homework 3 page 1 cs356 homework 3 handout 3 may 3 2004 this is due in one week may 10 2004 the last problem asks you to use a bdd calcula tor visualizer called ddcal that is installed on the epic systems see instructions for use on the cs356 web page however may nd ddcal helpful with some of the other problems for checking or even discovering your answers especially those that call for examples 1 prove the following algebraic properties the proofs can be done either by the geometric interpretation of constrain or by induction on number of variables in the bdd choosing the right approach to your proof can make the it simple a g f g f g b f g h f h g h in fact distributes over all boolean operators 2 shannon decomposition works with generalized cofactor as well as cofactoring on a single variable in other words f ite g f g f g g f g _ g f g prove it hint we found it useful to prove the lemma g f g f g rst 3 find two functions f and g where the bdd for f g is bigger than the bdd for f 4 please email me a le with the appropriate de nitions and commands using ddcal com pute the range of the three functions from input variables x 1 x2 and x 3 to output variables y1 y2 and y3 the functions are f 1 x 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 where is xor and f 3 x 1 _x2 _ x 3 a build a relation for the functions then existentially quantify the x variables b do co domain co factoring manually to compute the image then compare them some hints write a le with all the de nitions you need for this you can make it manageable by de ning names for interesting expressions you should display the bdds for both parts below using the displaying multiple functions feature note that the names of the functions must be simple identi ers not formulas you can inspect individual functions and expressions by typing them into the statement box at the bottom of the program here is how my le started for part a f1 x1 x2 f2 x1 x2 x3 f3 x1 x2 x3 y1 f1 y2 f2 y3 f3 for co domain co factoring i did g2 f2_f1 g3 f3_f1 ddcal is not all that reliable if you are getting funny results kill it and start over set the no complement edges option before loading a le 1
