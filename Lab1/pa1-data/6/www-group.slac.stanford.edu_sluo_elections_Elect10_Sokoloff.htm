michael sokoloff michael sokoloff i am an experimental particle physicist and a professor of physics at the university of cincinnati the focus of my research for the past 20 years has been flavor physics first at fermilab more recently at slac i have worked on babar for the past 15 years and i have been working on the proposed superb project since its inception in addition i started working on calibration simulations for the lsst a few years ago while the lsst will address a broad spectrum of issues in astronomy and cosmology my primary interest is in using weak lensing to study the distribution of dark matter in the universe slac's mission has changed substantially in the past 5 years while its primary focus is now photon science the laboratory should continue to play leading roles in accelerator science particle physics cosmology high energy astrophysics and detector r&d sluo can help sustain these efforts by working with laboratory management to identify how to foster coherent interference between slac scientists and the broader user community sluo has participated in lobbying efforts in conjunction with other hep user groups these efforts will become even more important as budgets are scrutinized by the newly elected congress on a more intellectual level sluo should create a set of cross disciplinary seminars to help unify the user community perhaps even courses to be taught using video conferencing and other distance learning technologies i am convinced that slac should remain a nexus for particle physics cosmology high energy astrophysics and accelerator science working on the sluo executive committee will give me an opportunity to help make this happen
