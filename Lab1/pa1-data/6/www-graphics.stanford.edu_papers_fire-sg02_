physically based modeling and animation of fire physically based modeling and animation of fire duc nguyen stanford university and industrial light and magic ronald fedkiw stanford university and industrial light and magic henrik wann jensen stanford university to appear siggraph 02 abstract we present a physically based method for modeling and animating fire our method is suitable for both smooth laminar and turbulent flames and it can be used to animate the burning of either solid or gas fuels we use the incompressible navier stokes equations to independently model both vaporized fuel and hot gaseous products we develop a physically based model for the expansion that takes place when a vaporized fule reacts to form hot gaseous products and a realted model for the similar expansion that takes place when a solid fuel is vaporized into a gaseous state the hot gaseous products smoke and soot rise under the influence of buoyancy and are rendered using a blackbody radiation model we also model and render the blue core that results from adicals in the chemical reaction zone where fuel is converted into products our method allows the fire and smoke to interact with objects and flammable objects can catch on fire pdf 605kb
