dc1 planning dc1 planning the planned kickoff date for dc1 is mid september 2003 the collaboration meeting in rome in order to get there we need want the following gleam validate subsystem geometry perform validations as deemed necessary decide on what is needed for further g4 validation and do it upgrade system tests for better diagnostics include the fsw onboard filter into gleam implement fluxes to create one day's data in orbit arrive at understanding on how to handle exposure complete background rejection analysis include classification tree and mechanism to use insightful miner output complete performance evaluation and parameterization make sure it is possible to enable failure modes in all subsystems add event classification algorithm and output define and implement final analysis ntuple level 1 database create an analysis platform for the event based analysis processing pipeline & related tools be able to generate the dc data via the pipeline and populate the database create web interface to show available data create tools to prune and concatenate the output datasets science tools readiness decide which tools will be applied to this challenge implement access to l1 gleam output documentation and tutorial document tds & root output classes document installation and use of analysis platform document installation and use of gleam prepare sample analysis prepare user tutorial for the collaboration meeting r dubois last modified 2003 04 20 15 29 28 0700
