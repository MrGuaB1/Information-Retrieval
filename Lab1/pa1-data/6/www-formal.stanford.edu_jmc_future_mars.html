moving mars closer to the sun 28 mar 2004 moving mars closer to the sun mars is unpleasantly cold for human habitation it would be easier to terraform mars if it were at the earth's distance from the sun either opposite the earth or perhaps in a trojan orbit relative to that of the earth moving mars with rockets would take unpleasantly long hundreds of millions of years according to some preliminary calculations if it were feasible at all here's how to do it in a some tens of thousands of years the orbit of an asteroid that crosses the orbits of jupiter mars earth and venus would be chaotic ie small deviations in initial course have large effects chaotic systems are inexpensively controllable if one is in a position to provide external forces our tame asteroid passes by jupiter mars and venus repeatedly it transfers energy and angular momentum between mars and these planets we need both venus and jupiter because both energy and angular momentum must be conserved the orbit is supposed to be such that only very very small delta v s must be infrequently be applied to the asteroid to keep it in the desired orbit if you like analogies with fundamental physics you can regard the asteroid as the carrier of an exchange force among mars jupiter and venus i d be surprised if the analogy turned out to be more than metaphorical how small the forces have to be depends on how long in advance you apply them here's how to get a lower bound on the time required ceres the largest asteroid has a mass about 1 1000 that of mars the delta v of the asteroid at an encounter with mars is at most twice the escape velocity from mars which is about 5 km sec therefore mars itself can experience a delta v of at most 0.01 km sec if we want a total 10 km sec we need at least 1000 encounters the time for an orbit is at least about the period of jupiter ie about 12 years this give 12000 years which must be multiplied by an inefficiency factor maybe 5 maybe 50 maybe 500 here are some questions 1 does a suitable orbit for the asteroid exist that can be maintained with small forces 2 if so what is the inefficiency factor how do we tame ceres in the first place preliminary calculations suggest that it would be expensive unless we can make jupiter do most of the work in connection with the idea of moving the earth a billion years from now to get farther from an increasingly hot sun korycanski laughlin and adams propose using a kuiper belt asteroid to carry energy and angular momentum this is a better idea than using an asteroid belt asteroid because the kuiper belt asteroids being much farther away from the sun are much easier to get started on a suitable trajectory see the detailed paper mentioned below for a full reference it looks like it would be easier to use a kuiper belt asteroid rather than a main belt asteroid because a very small delta v out there produces a large change in course when the asteroid comes in also there are asteroids bigger than ceres in the kuiper belt the price is that instead of the 12 year jupiter orbit we are dealing with hundreds of years i ve done some of the mathematics specifically that having to do with conservation of energy and angular momentum there are html dvi postscript and pdf versions of a more detailed paper q isn t a project taking tens of thousands of years ridiculous on the face of it a no present humanity only a few tens of years into space technology won t initiate such a project however conditions on earth can be kept suitable for humanity for a few billion years when humanity is 100000 years into the space age moving mars won t look ridiculous just from the time it would take if speculation on a large scale offends you too bad for you up to my john mccarthy's futurist page up to my john mccarthy's main page send comments to jmc cs stanford edu i sometimes make changes suggested in them john mccarthy the number of hits on this page since 1998 august 3
