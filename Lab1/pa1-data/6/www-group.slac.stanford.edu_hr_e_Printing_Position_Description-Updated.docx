ssrl postdoctoral associate for in situ diffraction during printing the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl has an opening for a postdoctoral associate to develop a printing setup that allows in situ investigation of thin film crystallization and formation printing is one of the key future technologies for the fabrication of inexpensive flexible organic circuitry including flexible organic solar cells we are looking for a postdoctoral associate who is interested in this subject in this position she he will study the mechanics and physics of the printing process with small molecule organic semiconductor inks specifically addressing the questions of how the printing process impacts the molecular packing and the film morphology and how those correlate with the electrical performance of printed thin films in organic solar cells and organic field effect transistors qualifications a ph d in either material science experimental applied physics electrical engineering or chemical engineering received no more than 3 years ago is required the candidate must have experience in independently developing and building experimental setups solution processing techniques and thin film preparation and characterization a basic knowledge of organic electronics and x ray scattering techniques is desirable but not required contact mannsfel slac stanford edu
