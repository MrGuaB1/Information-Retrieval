the return trip the return trip and so it began first we must descend a few hundred feet from the hills where we had camped then we followed a dry creek with occasional pools of water it was surprising to see little fish and frogs in the water chandra came across a rattle snake too then we hiked up poverty flat for quite some time the continuous ascent combined with very little shade to protect us from the relentless sun was quite an enervating experience the end of the trek back was surprisingly easy as we hiked through a forest with plenty of shade and then we were back at the visitor center where it all began we promptly got some fruit juice to celebrate our return prev coemorning satyaki das last modified wed sep 10 13 30 42 pdt 2003
