integration movies integration movies here are some animated gifs made from fred event display pictures of cosmic rays taken during different phases of integration and test of the lat instrument the blue lines are the reconstructed tracks the green lines or crosses are the tracker clusters and the red cubes are crystals in the calorimeter the yellow line is the extrapolation of the reconstructed track so you can see which acd tile the particle crossed the red square in an acd tile is the center of the acd tile with the smallest doca the color of the acd tiles depends on the threshold the signal in that tile passed red for veto and purple for the zero suppression threshold please remember to thank riccardo mr fred giannitrapani if you use these movies lat cosmic ray run with fsw run 077001260 for this particular run the run and event id are not available in the event display also note that the acd is turned off lat svac muon run run 135005345 lat the first events from an acd cpt run the yellow line is the extrapolation of the reconstructed track so you can see which acd tile the particle crossed the filled red square is the center of the acd tile with the smallest doca we are working on adding all the tiles that are hit sixteen towers without the acd muons all views rotated view eight towers muons and photon candidates six towers this is a test run with the two most recent cals not calibrated four towers the instrument is now calibrated four towers not everything looks like a muon four towers this is a test run with four towers in the grid the instrument is not completely calibrated which can be seen as increased noise in the calorimeters the tracks were required to through three towers which means that they barely touch the calorimeter two towers made from a series of short non calibrated test runs single event in 360 degrees and a series of events
