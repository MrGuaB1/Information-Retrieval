robert wiser's research page stagger tuned rf filtering faculty bruce wooley student robert wiser research summary a flat filter passband can potentially be obtained at ghz frequencies by combining q enhancement and staggered tuning on multiple isolated resonators precise control of each resonator's center frequency and q is required in order to shape the overall filter response to specification automatic tuning will be utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of an rf stagger tuned filter and the subsequent easing of tolerances on down stream circuitry education ph d candidate electrical engineering stanford university mse electrical engineering case western reserve university cleveland oh august 2002 bse electrical engineering case western reserve university cleveland oh may 2002 contact information center for integrated systems 077 via ortega & via pueblo stanford university stanford ca 94305 4070 phone 650 725 3719 email rwiser stanford edu ic lab integrated circuits lab cis center for integrated systems stanford stanford university home people projects publications links e mail cis home page ic lab
