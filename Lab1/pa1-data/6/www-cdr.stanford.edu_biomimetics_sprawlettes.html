the sprawlettes the sprawlettes a small family of biomimetic siblings body usage highlights sprawlette 01 sprawlette body 01 is currently equipped with modular legs that allow easy alterations to the stiffness it also has been outfitted with an analog compass which unfortunately does not work well on our lab floor due to magnetic fields below 2 light sensors and beacon mounting posts for leds using in overhead video capture sprawlette 02 sprawlette body 02 has also been outfitted with an analog compass 2 light sensors and beacon mounting posts for leds using in overhead video capture in addition to these sensors body 02 has a body length antenna sensor that is being used to follow walls similar to cockroaches sprawlette 04 porta sprawl sprawlette body 04 has been equipped with compliant legs that were designed based on adams dynamic simulations with added payloads it carries a basic stamp controller and rf receiver along with a battery pack to become near autonomous only a line for a compressed air supply is required to run the robot it can be controlled remotely by a key fob transmitter for more information on the design of the bodies click here
