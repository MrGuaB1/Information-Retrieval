3d painting on scanned surfaces maneesh agrawala maneesh pepper stanford edu andrew c beers beers cs stanford edu marc levoy levoy cs stanford edu abstract 1 introduction 2 system configuration 3 data representation 4 methods 4.1 object mesh registration 4.2 painting 4.3 brush effects 4.4 combating registration errors 5 results 6 future directions 7 conclusions we have developed an intuitive 3d interface for painting on 3d computer models using the sensor of a polhemus 6d tracker as a paintbrush the fundamental feature of our system is that a physical object provides a force feedback guide for painting our system is fast enough to paint a mesh in real time as the sensor is moved over the physical surface giving the user a sense of directly painting on the mesh with this system there is no need to perform a transformation from 2d input space to the 3d mesh surface as is required by other 3d painting systems that use a 2d input device also unlike other 3d painting systems the meshes we paint do not need to be parameterized in any way with our system an artist who is experienced with painting on 3d physical objects can almost directly apply that experience to painting on surface meshes 8 acknowledgments
