7th international workshop on tau lepton physics tau02 home the seventh international workshop on tau lepton physics tau02 was held on the uc santa cruz campus from tuesday september 10 through friday september 13 2002 the workshop was organized by the santa cruz intitute for particle physics scipp and the stanford linear accelerator center slac at the workshop the full range of physics accessible through the study of the tau lepton and its neutrino was systematically explored this includes physics from the b factories based on very high integrated luminosity running as well as results based on the full data sample from lep also precision physics topics where the tau data have an impact for example g 2 r and the running of a were presented and discussed a full session covered the status of neutrinos and their oscillations as with previous tau workshops significant time was allowed for people to talk with each other about the physics its implications and how the experiments can make the most of the large data samples to be accumulated in the future important proceedings now available on econf email tau02 scipp ucsc edu
