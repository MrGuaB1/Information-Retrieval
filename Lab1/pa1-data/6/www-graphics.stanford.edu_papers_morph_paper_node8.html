feature based 3d warping using fields next up previous next individual feature elements up warping previous warping feature based 3d warping using fields the purpose of a feature element is to identify a feature of an object for example consider the x 29 plane of figure 6b an element can be used to delineate the nose of the plane in feature based morphing elements come in pairs one element in the source volume and its counterpart in the target volume a pair of elements identifies corresponding features in the two volumes ie features that should be transformed to one another during the morph for instance when morphing the dart of figure 6a to the x 29 plane the tip of the dart should turn into the nose of the plane in order to obtain good morphs we need to specify a collection of element pairs which define the overall correspondence of the two objects these element pairs interact like magnets shaping a pliable volume while a single magnet can only move turn and stretch the volume multiple magnets generate interacting fields termed influence fields which combine to shape the volume in complex ways sculpting with multiple magnets becomes easier if we have magnets of various kinds in our toolbox each magnet generating a differently shaped influence field the elements in our toolkit are points line segments rectangles and boxes in the following presentation we first describe individual elements and discuss how they identify features we then show how a pair of elements guarantees that corresponding features are transformed to one another during the morph finally we discuss how multiple element pairs interact last update 11 may 1995 by apostolos toli lerios tolis cs stanford edu
