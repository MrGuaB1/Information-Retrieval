democracy the party system back to index democracy the party system every victorious power tries to impose its system whether it be communism fascism or democracy each trumpets the merits of its system in the west the us is especially vocal in promoting its variety even those many think there are better democratic systems one obvious shortcoming of our form of democracy is the party system in which each party tries to score points not to solve problems people were born into either republican or democratic families almost like an inherited religion americans are getting tired of the abuses of the party system and more and more are declaring themselves independent ie mugwumps the party system with its inheritance features is a very old story as gilbert and sullivan say in iolanthe when in that house mps divide if they ve a brain and cerebellum too they ve got to leave that brain outside and vote just as their leaders tell em too no man can view with equanimity that every boy and every gal that's born into the world alive is either a little liberal or a little conservative margaret mackenzie tells us that the syme family are well known passionate supporters of the party of the democrats in rarotonga and that the george family are equally longtime advocates of the cook islands party politics is a zealous sport in rarotonga and everyone including any longterm visitor to a family is interpreted as belonging to the party to which the family is affiliated should families split in their political affiliations there is severe internal family trouble everyone on the island reads the newspaper for the relish of interpreting who is controlling what and whichever party is in power has a very strong hand in what is published with the democrats advocating a stronger position about freedom of the press rarotongans do not believe that anyone is capable of objectivity so they take for granted that we all have interests whether we state them or not ronald hilton 6 20 01 webmaster
