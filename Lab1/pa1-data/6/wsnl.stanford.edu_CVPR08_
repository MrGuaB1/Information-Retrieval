cvpr 2008 short course distributed vision processing in smart camera networks ieee conference on computer vision and pattern recognition cvpr 2008 short course distributed vision processing in smart camera networks anchorage alaska monday june 23 2008 lecturers hamid aghajan stanford university usa andrea cavallaro queen mary university of london uk scope lectures interesting links contact scope distributed vision networks is a multi disciplinary research field that defines rich conceptual and algorithmic opportunities for the fields of computer vision signal processing pervasive computing and wireless sensor networks it also creates opportunities for design paradigm shifts in these fields given its emphasis on distributed and collaborative fusion of visual information enabling researchers in the named areas to participate in the creation of novel smart environment applications that are interpretive context aware and user centric in nature technological advances in the design of image sensors and embedded processors have facilitated the development of efficient embedded vision based techniques design of scalable network based applications based on high bandwidth data such as images requires a change of paradigm in the processing methodologies instead of streaming raw images to a powerful central processing unit in the new paradigm each network node utilizes local processing to translate the observed data into features and attributes which are shared with other network nodes to make a collaborative deduction about the event of interest building upon the premise of distributed vision based sensing and processing many novel application areas in smart environments such as patient and elderly care ambient intelligence multimedia and gaming can be enabled design based on access to a networked set of sources of visual information provides researchers in the vision processing discipline with novel research opportunities not only through introducing the notion of spatial collaboration in data fusion among the network nodes but also in considering the effective ways of network wide collaboration and levels in which data can be exchanged between the nodes in such a framework data fusion can occur across the three dimensions of 3d space multiple views time and feature levels joint estimation and decision making techniques need to be developed taking into account the processing capabilities of the nodes as well as the network bandwidth limits and application latency requirements spatiotemporal data fusion algorithms employing information obtained by the network across the dimensions of space time and feature levels and the impacts of the various cost and efficiency tradeoffs need to be examined against the requirements of the application in addition deductions produced by collaborative processing in the network can be used as feedback to each camera node to enable active vision techniques by instructing each camera as to which features may be of importance to extract in its view the target audience for the course consists of researchers active in the various vision based interpretive applications such as human presence and gesture analysis as well as graduate students involved in vision algorithm design research the course offers a perspective of the various methodologies based on the flexibilities and tradeoffs introduced by distributed vision sensing and processing as a result of providing such perspective the course aims to encourage participation of vision researchers in developing novel algorithms based on the potentials of distributed smart cameras lectures part i vision for smart environments smart cameras case study spatial fusion case study human pose analysis case study occupancy services interfacing vision part ii filtering and annotation localization algorithms multi camera analysis sensor fusion event detection interesting links acm ieee int conf on distributed smart cameras icdsc eccv workshop on multi camera and multi modal sensor fusion algorithms and applications m2sfa2 contact for further inquiry about the special session program please contact aghajan at stanford edu andrea cavallaro at elec qmul ac uk
