li erp home october 23 25 2002 stanford california laser issues for electron rf photoinjectors proceedings photoinjectors are increasingly the system of choice for modern electron accelerators primarily because they can produce a low emittance beam in particular the performance of low emittance rf photoinjectors is crucial for sase fels the requirements for the associated injector laser systems have a number of common yet critical features concerning intensity uniformities and stabilities that altogether can approach the limit of what is commercially available this workshop is designed to explore these features and to seek solutions to important outstanding problems slac logo contact paul bolton for more information
