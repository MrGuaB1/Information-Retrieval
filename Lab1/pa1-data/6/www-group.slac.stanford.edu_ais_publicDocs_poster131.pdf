progress and prospects page 1 advanced instrumentation seminars guest speaker mark bautz mit the impressive progress of observa tional high energy astrophysics over the past decade owes much to technology developed in the 1980's and 1990's i will review the ccd detector technol ogy at the heart of current x ray obser vatories describe the most recent advances in x ray ccd performance and discuss the fundamental limitations of these detectors i ll then survey efforts at mit and elsewhere to surmount these limitations by adapting active pixel sensor architectures to the needs of x ray astronomy including our development of a three dimensionally integrated x ray imager i will also describe recent progress at mit's space nanostructures laboratory towards blazed transmission gratings for high resolution dispersive spectrographs for x ray astronomy i ll conclude with a discussion of the capabilities these technologies will ultimately provide for the high energy astrophysical observatories of the 2020s http www group slac stanford edu ais june 9 2010 1 30 pm 1st floor kavli auditorium progress and prospects for high resolution imaging & dispersive spectroscopy for x ray astronomy
