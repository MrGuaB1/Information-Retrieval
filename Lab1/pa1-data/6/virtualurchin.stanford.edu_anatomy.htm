start primary programming by colin truousdale csumb capstone project additional programming by jason hodin explore the internal and external anatomy of the sea urchin male female nerve ring gonads water vascular system digestive system aristotle's lantern spines and pedicellaria tube feet test check your knowledge spines & pedicellaria the spines are the urchin's primary mode of defense against hungry predators the spines are used by some species to burrow into rock by slowly scraping away an enclosure to further protect themselves the spines are controled by two rings of mucles and are covered with a layer of epithlium at the base of the sea urchin's spines are the pedicellaria which are small pinching appendages explore the internal and external anatomy of the sea urchin urchin anatomy male female nerve ring gonads water vascular system digestive system aristotle's lantern spines and pedicellaria tube feet test check your knowledge digestive system along with the five gonads the digestive tract takes up most of the internal space of the sea urchin urchins are most known for eating kelp but will eat sponges and other invertebrates as well waste is expelled though the anus located at the top of the body explore the internal and external anatomy of the sea urchin urchin anatomy male female nerve ring gonads water vascular system digestive system aristotle's lantern spines and pedicellaria tube feet test check your knowledge tube feet the tube feet are the primary means of locomotion for the sea urchin lateral movement is accomplished by means of paired muscles in the tube foot itself and extension and retraction by muscles in the hydraulic bulb behind each tube foot while each foot may seems weak and ineffective the large numbers of feet make up for their size explore the internal and external anatomy of the sea urchin urchin anatomy reset help x find the organ or structure that corresponds to the description below roll over the pictures to reveal the name of the organ or structure select the correct organ or structure and drag it to the correct location don t forget the insets at left some of the organs or structures belong there continue until you have reconstructed the urchin good luck help go back unlike their cousins the vertebrates which have circulatory systems of blood sea urchins have this system for moving fluids around the body urchin organ test do you know your urchin anatomy male female nerve ring gonads water vascular system digestive system aristotle's lantern spines and pedicellaria tube feet test check your knowledge nerve ring sea urchins have no brain as we think of it instead they have a nerve ring near the hydraulic system that powers the tube feet explore the internal and external anatomy of the sea urchin urchin anatomy
