cdr projects share view a share overview of cdr projects project strategy cdr provides share with a balance of three strategic types of design engineering results services tools that can be used theory about the design process practice of design engineering the services depend upon the theory and both use practice as a testbed forming the interacting strategic triangle above all of the cdr projects fit within this triangle to provide deliverables an electronic notebook perspective cdr projects contribute enabling technology to future electronic design notebooks a major entry point into use of the internet for design and engineering note electronic design notebook edn is a registered trademark of the pgc cdr is not building such a notebook our research complements explicit notebook efforts particularly the dice mece project cdr's deliverables are unique technologies that result from our study of the design process it is however very useful to say what future electronic design and engineering notebooks should do and how they should interact with designers and engineers we have attempted to do so partially by characterizing cdr projects in terms of their contributions to the share project some of these projects are developing the technolgy we need to interact with such electronic notebooks in a way that will be useful to engineers and designers this subcollection of cdr projects we group together as electronic design notebook foundations another subcollection of projects can be seen to be developing the enabling technologies for notebook functions these electronic design notebook resources can be characterized according to a matrix of functions and interactions more detail is available about this rationale for a share view of cdr projects which contains further detail on the electronic design notebook foundations and resources including detail on functions and interactions search the cdr wwweb pages with keywords of your choice charles petrie
