description of binpixel home iset sensor pixel binning binpixel m binpixel purpose apply pixel binning algorithm to voltage image synopsis function sensor binpixel sensor bmethod description apply pixel binning algorithm to voltage image sensor binpixel sensor bmethod the voltage image should already have shot noise dark current and etendue factored in it should not have read noise or the fixed pattern noises factored in there are several different vendor methods for pixel binning we start with one implementation kodak others will follow see the wiki page notes http white stanford edu pdcwiki index php pixel_binning some of the binning methods require digital calculations after quantization these are handled in the related routine pixelbin2 current algorithms kodak2008 adds columns in voltage digitizes averages digital rows addadjacentblocks adds voltage values of all the r g b pixels in a 4x4 region averageadjacentdigitalblocks averages digital values of all the r g b pixels in a 4x4 to create a 2x2 shrinking the image size by a factor of 4 maybe this belongs in a complete post processing algorithm that would compete with sensor binning that group would blur and sub sample like this this one blurs with a tophat function there is also the issue of doing this prior or post demosaicking see also binpixelpost binsensorcompute binsensorcomputeimage cross reference information this function calls this function is called by generated on tue 10 jan 2012 21 55 33 by m2html 2005
