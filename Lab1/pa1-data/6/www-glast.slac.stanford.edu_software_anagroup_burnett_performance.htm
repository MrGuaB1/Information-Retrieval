glast sensitivity presentation glast sensitivity estimates toby burnett analysis group presentation 11 oct 04 updated 10 oct 2004 19 17 0700 all of these plots and numbers are preliminary for glast internal use only with exception below previous analysis group presentations on this subject 24 may 04 19 july 04 13 sept 04 detailed documents recently updated am 04355 a simple functional representation for the glast psf introducing the following very successful function with detailed analysis of its properties for point source detection and localization am 04356 lat effective area and point spread function an evaluation of post dc1 performance with fits to the psf parameters s g in 8 energy x 8 angle bins for both front and back sections am 04369 sensitivity for point source detection combining the psf analysis with a simplified model to the psf and aeff functional dependence to predict point source sensitivity what is new psf function analysis of point source localization see the 13 sept 04 presentation plots of 68 and 95 percentile points g p is the gamma parameter defined above effective area and psf analysis create a fit to measured average aeff 0 66 0 that does not droop note average is defined by an integral over the sphere point source sensitivity now uses the logistic functional form of aeff constant above 10 gev see above adjust assumed background to srd figure from 1.57 to 1.50 emphasize that times are all live time not elapsed time new plot to show sensitivity for specific energies this plot or the data it displays has been approved for general release if labeled preliminary new plot to calculate the morselli integral sensitivity used to compare with other missions and ground based detectors
