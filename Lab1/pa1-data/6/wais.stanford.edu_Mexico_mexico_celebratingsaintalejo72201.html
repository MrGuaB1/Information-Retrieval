mexico celebrating saint alejo back to index mexico celebrating saint alejo alejo orvananos reports yes i celebrated my saint's day as i have all my life in some families it is a more important day that birthdays yes in my case alejo is from alexis i was named after my father who was named after his grandfather alexis who was born in ahinoa a little town have in the french pyrenees near biarritz my oldest son and now his new baby are also alejos in many communities according to local traditions people are named after and dedicated to the saint who is officially celebrated on the day they are born so in fact their saint s day and birthday coincide a complementary explanation for odd names specially in small towns involves several families that share the same last name but are not related they want their children to be unique and distinguishable from others in the community ie to avoid the confusion of there being in town a number of people named juan perez parents become creative and name them differently from traditional names i once met a man named fridiaire gonzalez in san critobal chiapas my comment i suppose that means frigidaire a novelty in san cristobal a similar custom exists among american blacks all these alejos puzzle me it must be hard to arrange for all of them to be born on the saint's day if you have seven alejos shout alejo and all seven come running adopt my system alejo 1 2 3 etc another problem i can t imagine all these alejos imitating the saint's way of life but that is the theory ronald hilton 7 22 01 webmaster
