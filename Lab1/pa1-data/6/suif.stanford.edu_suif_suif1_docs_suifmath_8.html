the suifmath library row math go to the previous next section row math many of the mathematical functions that are available for matrices are also applicable to a single row of integers in the following list the symbols a and b are of the class integer_row and x i and j are integers and o is a boolean x a i a i y read and modify the i th element of the row a o a b are rows a and b are identical is also available c a b add the corresponding elements of the two rows a and b and put the results in c c a b subtract the corresponding elements of the two rows a and b and put the results in c c a b multiply the corresponding elements of a and b and put the results in c c a add the corresponding elements of a to the row c c a subtract the corresponding elements of a from the row c c a multiply the elements of c by the corresponding elements of a c a x add the integer x to each element of a and put the results in c c a x subtract the integer x form each element of a and put the results in c c a x multiply each element of a by the integer x and put the results in c c a x divide each element of a by the integer x and put the results in c c x add the integer x to each element of c c x subtract the integer x from each element of c c x multiply each element of a by the integer x c x divide each element of a by the integer x go to the previous next section
