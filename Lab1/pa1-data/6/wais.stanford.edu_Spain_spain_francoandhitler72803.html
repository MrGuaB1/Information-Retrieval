spain franco and hitler back to index spain franco and hitler christopher jones says churchill supports his assertion about franco's frustrating hiler's plans it seems that modern scholarship has drafted winston churchill into the franco propaganda machine maybe because churchill was a tory at any rate in winston churchill's the second world war vol 2 their finest hour pages 519 530 the wartime british prime minister wrote that hitler's juggernaut was stopped by franco it is fashionable at the present to dwell on the vices of general franco and i am glad therefore to place on record this testimony to the duplicity of his dealings with hitler i shall presently record even greater services which general franco rendered the allied cause it is true that franco moved spain from strict neutrality to non belligerency but spain reclaimed strict neutrality in 1943 i am not at home at the moment so i made a small mistake the hitler franco meeting took place in october 1940 not 1941 which makes franco's refusal to join hitler even more astounding i wonder how these respected scholars explain franco's help to sephardic jews fleeing nazi persecution it has been well documented even in wais ronald hilton 7 28 03 webmaster
