bfem root class definitions root class definitions date of last update 10 31 02 this page gives an overview of the content of the raw digi recon and housekeeping root files note that the root classes have the same internal structure for both the bfem and full flight instrument simulations for the pdr raw corresponds to the fields that are filled with raw data information recon corresponds to the fields that are filled with data that has already been processed by recon hsk corresponds to fields that are filled with data from housekeeping mctruth corresponds to the fields that are filled with monte carlo data that is available from the geant4 bfem simulation class diagrams raw recon raw data the raw digi data is stored in root files using the structure defined by the digirootdata classes raw digi root files are designed to store detector data here is a full description of the digirootdata package a description of the functions in the digirootdata package is available here here is the logical structure of the raw digi root files reconstruction data the reconstruction data is stored in root files using the structure defined by the reconrootdata classes reconstruction root files are designed to store all of the details of the reconstruction output here is a full description of the reconrootdata package recon getreconflags getcalrecon gettkrrecon getcalcluster getlogene getsiclusters gettracks getgamma geteventid getcallog geteminus getcenterstrip getchi2 getlocator getrunid getcsialpha geteplus getid getenergydet gettracks hasrecon getcsilambda getid getlayer getenergyinput hastkrrecon getcsistart getnumstrips getfirstlayer hasgamma getdirection getposition gethits hasmanytracks getecorr getxy getid hascalrecon getenelayer getzposition getlocator hascalgood getesum getmother hascalfair getfitenergy getnumclusters hascalpoor getid getquality hascalnoenergyrecon getposition getresidual getprofchisq gettracktype getxlayer getylayer here is the logical structure for the reconstruction files
