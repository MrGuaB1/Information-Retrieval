egse concept for lat egse software go backward to development schedule go up to top egse software the egse software can be segmented into four primary components realtime system command and control software data acquisition quality verification archive and distribution data visualization and analysis the first area of support is for the realtime system which runs in the em1 pci crate or in the em2 qu and fu sis crate this software will probably run under the vxworks operating system and will be responsible for acquiring data from the tem or t&df and sending commands to the tem or t&df in the sis the software will also service the cots i o board analogs and discretes which includes control signals to the siu for power control these systems are similar in complexity to the balloon interface unit biu flight software and will probably be developed from that system the remaining software is resident on the egse workstations the command and control software will probably be a cots product with some tailoring candidates include os comet scs21 scl and epoch2000 the data acquisition and handling software may also be a cots product although it will require substantial tailoring for our applications each of the previously mentioned system provide some data handling other candidates include sets and datahub both generated at stanford the data visualization and analysis software may well involve more than one cots product candidates are root idl matlab and the above mentioned commercial products which also provides data displays scott williams stanford edu
