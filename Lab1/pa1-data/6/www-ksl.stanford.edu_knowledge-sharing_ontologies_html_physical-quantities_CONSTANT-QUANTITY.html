class constant quantity in theory physical quantities class constant quantity defined in theory physical quantities source code physical quantities lisp slots on this class documentation a constant quantity is a constant value of some physical quantity like 3 meters or 55 miles per hour constant quantities are distinguished from function quantities which map some quantities to other quantities for example the velocity of a particle over some range of time would be represented by a function quantity mapping values of time which are constant quantities to velocity vectors also constant quantities all real numbers and numeric tensors of higher order are constant quantities whose dimension is the identity dimension ie the so called dimensionless or dimensionless quantity all constant quantites can be expressed as the product of some dimensionless quantity and a unit of measure this is what it means to say a quantity has a magnitude for example 2 meters can be expressed as 3 meter where meter is defined as a unit of measure for length all units of measure are also constant quantities subclass of physical quantity axioms constant quantity x and physical quantity x not function quantity x notes example constant quantity height fred why not associate a fixed unit of measure with a quantity assume that quantities have a property like q unit then define two quantities q1 the quantity 10 centimeters and q2 the quantity 0.1 meters clearly q1 q2 but q unit q1 centimeters and q unit q2 meters this is a contradiction why include numbers as quantities this allows one to commit to the engineering math ontologies without having to handle all the units and dimensions the theory can include all of normal math as a special case
