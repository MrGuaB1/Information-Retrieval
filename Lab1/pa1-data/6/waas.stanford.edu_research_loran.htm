loran information from the stanford gps lab people publications resources jpals laas waas loran news home long range navigation loran the long range navigation radionavigation system loran is a terrestrial high power hyperbolic navigation system operating in the 90 to 110 khz frequency band the loran system became operational in 1958 and has been in service since then primarily serving the maritime community loran is well suited for the role of back up to gps it is a terrestrial low frequency navigation system that utilizes whose signal pulses are high powered and not line of sight dependent hence it is not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities as gps while being able to provide similar capabilities in both navigation and timing frequency services one drawback for aviation is that loran has never been certified for approaches and prior attempts in the late 1980s to certify loran for approach failed due to several deficiencies in the system new technology and upgrades to the system has mitigated or eliminated all of the noted deficiencies the faa has chartered the loran integrity performance panel loripp to determine if loran can meet the aviation requirements for non precision approach npa in light of new technology and reasonable system changes stanford university plays a prominent role in the leadership of the loripp as well as the research conducted by this group the loran efforts at stanford university are focused on developing loran for aviation this work provides additional redundancy to gps in safety or economically critical applications particularly aviation this helps create a safe and robust infrastructure for aviation and other navigation and timing applications based primarily on gps primary areas of work are system design system integration atmospheric noise analysis of groundwave effects hazard analysis researchers faculty prof per enge staff sherman lo students lee boyce summary the aeronautics and astronautics department at stanford university is internationally recognized for academic and research excellence and the gps laboratory plays an increasingly important role in developing and demonstrating new capabilities for space based navigational systems in addition to fundamental advances in positioning and navigation technologies the lab plays a critical role in the operational readiness of the wide area and local area augmentation systems waas and laas the gps lab includes recipients of the charles stark draper prize 03 the johannes kepler award 91 and 00 and the thurlow award 86 and 96 in the area of loran it includes recipients of the international loran association ila william polhemus 00 and ila president's award 03 for further information on stanford university's gps laboratory please contact prof per enge for information on loran research please contact dr sherman lo primary cooperating groups peterson integrated geopositioning llc dr benjamin peterson capt uscg retired booz allen hamilton capt g thomas gunther uscg retired capt robert j wenzel uscg retired northrop grumman information technology dr peter morris united states coast guard capt richard hartnett uscg academy cdr gordon weeks cdr john macaluso lt kevin carroll ohio university dr david diggle sponsor federal aviation administration faa mr mitchell narins loran c evaluation program manager faa top people publications resources jpals laas waas loran home copyright 2004 stanford university site design academic web pages site suggestions by the education online team
