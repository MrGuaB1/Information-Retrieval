cs348b rendering competition cs 348b rendering competition cs 348b computer graphics image synthesis techniques course description cs 348b teaches the principles of generating images from geometric and optical descriptions of scenes the course covers topics in sampling theory as applied to computer graphics local and global illumination and grayscale and color display theory and technology project and competition since 1992 the central project of the course has consisted of writing a ray tracer which encompasses sampling techniques texture mapping global illumination following the rays through multiple bounces and distribution ray tracing to demonstrate angular variations in surface reflectance in addition the students participate in a render off competition to generate the best image or set of images including animations the winner is selected by a panel of computer graphics experts drawn from industry and academia and receives an all expenses paid trip to siggraph the following summer images from past competitions winter 1992 winter 1993 winter 1994 winter 1995 spring 1996 spring 1997 spring 1998 spring 1999 spring 2000 spring 2001 spring 2002 spring 2003 spring 2004 spring 2005 spring 2006 spring 2007 spring 2008 resources the principal computer resource used in the competition and throughout the course is the stanford graphics instructional lab sgilab the computational and graphics resources of this lab have been upgraded several times during these years in 1992 the lab consisted of 10 silicon graphics personal irises 32 mb 33 mhz r3000 processor in 1994 the lab was upgraded to 15 silicon graphics indigos xzs 64 mb 100 mhz r4000 processor gr2 xz graphics board in 1996 18 indigo extremes 128 mb 250 mhz r4400 gu1 extreme graphics board were added in 1998 the xzs were upgraded to octanes 128 mb 175 mhz r10010 processor si graphics board in 2002 the lab used for this course consisted of 30 pcs running linux 15 equipped with 730mhz piiis and 256 mb ram and 15 with 1000mhz piiis and 512 mb ram the software available for the course has included a simple interactive modeler and a scene composing package which reads in objects designed in the modeler and allows interactive manipulation of viewing and lighting parameters object position and scale in 3 space and surface parameters such as color and shininess the scene composer was built atop sgi's inventor software a 3 d graphics toolkit written in c++ since moving to the linux platform software provided has included lrt a ray tracer developed by greg humphreys and matt pharr and freeware modeling packages like moonlight 3d atelier last update saturday 04 dec 2004 09 29 50 pst
