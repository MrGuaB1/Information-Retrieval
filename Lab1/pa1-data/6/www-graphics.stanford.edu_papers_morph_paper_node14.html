linear cross dissolving next up previous next non linear cross dissolving up blending previous blending linear cross dissolving the pixel cross dissolving of 2d morphing suggests a linear indeed it works well for blending the color information of and however it fails to interpolate opacities in a manner such that the rendered morph sequence appears smooth this is due to the exponential dependence of the color of a ray cast through the volume on the opacities of the voxels it encounters this phenomenon is illustrated in the morph of figure 5 in particular the morph abruptly snaps into the source and target volumes if a linear is used figure 5g shows that at time very early in the morph the empty space towards the front of the human head has already been filled in by the warped orangutan volume last update 11 may 1995 by apostolos toli lerios tolis cs stanford edu
