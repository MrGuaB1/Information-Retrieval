kalman filter validation page 1 kalman filter validation updates 1 correct 3d covariance matrix now in place 2 correct 3d 2 calculation now in place ref data analysis tech in hep by fruthwirth et al validation concept test covariance correlated errors against monte carlo and end to end approach procedure use muons at 1 gev over all angles tell the fitter the exact energy turn off plane by plane energies page 2 expectation 2 distribution with a mean of 1 df 2 distribution not to depend on track direction etc overall distribution note 2 2 this is because in 3d there are 2 meas per ssd plane one poor this factor of 2 has been fixed in the cvs version cuts 1 track found fitted & 11 hits on track page 3 large angle 2 small angle 2 page 4 no  dependence found as well also note that the finding efficiency extends to cos  2 but more on pr next week
