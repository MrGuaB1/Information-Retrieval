sunil golwala sunil golwala slac is at a critical time it is redefining its mission and its role in serving the user community moving from being a lab where particle physics experiments are done and the science happens to being a facility that through its significant resources and stability can play a unique scientific technical and management role in broadly distributed projects covering a wide range of science in response to the interests of its staff and the user community slac is investing a substantial portion of its efforts now in particle astrophysics and cosmology given this one of sluo's primary roles should be to help slac make such investments where they can have the greatest impact technically and scientifically furthermore in the doe environment the labs play a central role not just in the execution of the science but also in the communication to doe headquarters of what science should be pursued sluo is the primary conduit of the interests of the community to slac management and thus plays a crucial role in ensuring doe priorities reflect those of the scientific community it is critical that the labs work together and present a unified message to doe management about what new projects in particle astrophysics and cosmology should be done and how they can be most reasonably be supported by the various labs given their differing expertise and internal structure and sluo can play an important role in ensuring that such coordination is put into place my background is in particle astrophysics and cosmology i work on the supercdms wimp dark matter search and on studies of galaxy clusters using the sunyaev zeldovich effect and instrumentation for these efforts i have also been involved in cmb polarization instrumentation and measurements i am the spokesperson of geodm a proposed ton scale wimp dark matter search at the deep underground science and engineering lab dusel i received my phd from berkeley in 2000 and am currently a professor at caltech i am a new slac user having just begun my interaction with slac with the initiation of a supercdms group led by eduardo do couto e silva in 2009 however my experience with fnal through cdms supercdms with slac and with the nascent dusel provide me with a broad view of how the doe and nsf national labs interact with the scientific community i also have the broad scientific and cultural knowledge of these fields as well as the interest in seeing slac participate fully in them to help the slac user community voice its opinions on this process and to help slac seek out the best opportunities in particle astrophysics and cosmology and communicate those interests to doe
