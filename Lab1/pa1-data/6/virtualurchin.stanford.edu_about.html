about us virtual urchin about us home interactive tutorials fertilization & development microscope measurement anatomy predator & prey microscope tutorial microscope compare specimen compare acid ocean teacher resources useful links about us gametes of sea urchins yield exceptional experiences in the classroom teachers and students alike are riveted by being able to observe fertilization cell division and embryonic development the gametes are easy to use the developmental stages are readily seen with the microscope and the rapidity of fertilization and early cell divisions allows the student to ask questions and obtain answers within the bounds of a normal classroom schedule the utility of urchins for inquiry based science is unrivaled the goal of this project is to make these remarkable embryos readily accessible through development of inquiry based lessons available on an open access website students can then move beyond the early embryo and explore how scientists study sea urchins to understand larval development and metamorphosis community ecology pollution in the marine environment and biological evolution the virtual urchin team consists of principle investigator dr david epel sea urchin biologist dr jason hodin acclaimed teacher pamela miller and educational technology specialist dr camillan huang voss much of the research highlighted on our site has been conducted in dr epel's laboratory at stanford university's hopkins marine station the virtual urchin project is funded by the national science foundation
