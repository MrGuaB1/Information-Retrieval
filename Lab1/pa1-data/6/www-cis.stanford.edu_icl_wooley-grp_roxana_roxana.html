roxana trofin's research page high resolution ultra low power data conversion for neural imaging faculty bruce wooley student roxana trofin research summary the implementation of future instruments for capturing neural activity in the brain requires data acquisition with good noise immunity high resolution and extremely low levels of power consumption a d converters based on sigma delta modulation are especially well suited to achieving the resolution requirements expected for such systems however in array configurations of conventional oversampling modulators the attendant power dissipation seems likely to exceed the requirements foreseen for neural imaging applications the immediate purpose of this research is to find novel architectural techniques for power reduction such as signal multiplexing and stage sharing low power circuit implementations such as those based on subthreshold circuit design will also be investigated education ms electrical engineering stanford university 2004 current ba sc computer engineering university of waterloo canada 2004 contact information center for integrated systems rm 125 via ortega & via pueblo stanford university stanford ca 94305 email rtrofin stanford edu ic lab integrated circuits lab cis center for integrated systems stanford stanford university home people projects publications links e mail cis home page ic lab
