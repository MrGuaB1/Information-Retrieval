fast volume rendering using a shear warp factorization of the viewing transformation philippe lacroute and marc levoy fast volume rendering using a shear warp factorization of the viewing transformation proc siggraph 94 orlando florida july 1994 pp 451 458 abstract several existing volume rendering algorithms operate by factoring the viewing transformation into a 3d shear parallel to the data slices a projection to form an intermediate but distorted image and a 2d warp to form an undistorted final image we extend this class of algorithms in three ways first we describe a new object order rendering algorithm based on the factorization that is significantly faster than published algorithms without loss of image quality the algorithm achieves its speed by exploiting coherence in the volume data and the intermediate image the shear warp factorization permits us to traverse both the volume and the intermediate image data structures in synchrony during rendering using both types of coherence to reduce work our implementation running on an sgi indigo workstation renders a 256 3 voxel medical data set in one second our second extension is a derivation of the factorization for perspective viewing transformations and we show how our rendering algorithm can support this extension third we introduce a data structure for encoding spatial coherence in unclassified volumes ie scalar fields with no precomputed opacity when combined with our shear warp rendering algorithm this data structure allows us to classify and render a 256 3 voxel volume in three seconds our algorithms employ run length encoding min max pyramids and multi dimensional summed area tables the method extends readily to support mixed volumes and geometry additional information available optical scan of paper from acm digital library pdf file color figures tif fig 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 most of the color figures can be found here a few more color images the volpack volume rendering library
