fg08 special session multi sensor hci for smart environments 8th ieee int l conference on automatic face and gesture recognition fg 2008 amsterdam the netherlands september 17 19 2008 special session on multi sensor hci for smart environments scope program panel discussion organizers dates contact scope the 2008 edition of the ieee int l conference on face and gesture will feature a special session devoted to multi sensor hci for smart environments integration of multiple sensors in a distributed hci application embodies new research opportunities in algorithm design methods based on collaborative sensing and processing data fusion event interpretation context extraction and generation of behaviour models moreover developing proper algorithmic interfaces between the quantitative information units in charge of sensing and processing and the high level qualitative information units in charge of context and behaviour models is an area of growing inter disciplinary research interest this special session aims to offer a perspective onto the newest trends in multi sensor hci development for user centric smart environments by including contributions from active researchers in the field covering a variety of recent innovative projects the session provides an insight into the new paradigms employed in the design of such systems and the challenges in making pervasive and unobtrusive interfaces for smart environments a reality through covering topics from sensing to interpretation and application development the special session also aims to instil awareness in different research communities of the various potentials for collaboration in this multi disciplinary topic program friday september 19 2008 14 00 15 55 special session talks 14 00 14 20 anton nijholt meeting behavior detection in smart environments nonverbal cues that help to obtain natural interaction mannes poel ronald poppe and anton nijholt university of twente the netherlands 14 20 14 40 rainer stiefelhagen tracking identities and attention in smart environments contributions and progress in the chil project rainer stiefelhagen keni bernardin hazim k ekenel michael voit universitaat karlsruhe germany 14 40 15 00 daniel gatica perez identifying dominant people in meetings from audio visual sensors daniel gatica perez 1 2 and hayley hung 2 1 epfl and 2 idiap switzerland 15 00 15 20 christopher wren ambient intelligence as the bridge to the future of pervasive computing christopher wren and yuri ivanov merl usa panel discussion 15 20 15 55 interplay of concept and technology in advancing smart environments development historically many applications dubbed as examples of smart environments aka ambient intelligence have been conceptualized by researchers in the computing communities prior to the existence of viable technologies to enable them on the other hand the plethora of novel sensing and interactivity technologies introduced in recent years has ushered in an unprecedented opportunity to create new types of real time applications in daily life for comfort well being and entertainment proliferation of such technologies is setting the stage for development of even more advanced application concepts the panel will explore the interplay of concept and technology in advancing development in this area and aims to provide clues to the research and development directions with the highest potential in shaping the future of smart environments panelists anton nijholt univ ot twente the netherlands rainer stiefelhagen universitaat karlsruhe germany daniel gatica perez idiap switzerland christopher wren merl usa ralph braspenning philips research the netherlands louis philippe morency univ of southern california usa moderator richard kleihorst nxp semiconductor research the netherlands organizers special session chairs hamid aghajan stanford university usa ming hsuan yang honda research usa dates paper submission april 14 2008 review results may 31 2008 camera ready june 28 2008 fg 08 conference september 17 19 2008 paper page limit 6 pages for latex template click here please email the pdf to hamid aghajan at the following address contact for further inquiry about the special session program please contact
