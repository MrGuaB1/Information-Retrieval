the zippack polygon mesh zippering package the zippack polygon mesh zippering package zipper is a program for combining range images into a polygonal mesh it was specifically created to more fully use range images acquired from a cyberware range scanner with appropriate file conversion however there is nothing preventing the use of zipper with range images taken with other scanners the research results from the zipper program are described in the article zippered polygon meshes from range images by greg turk and marc levoy published in the siggraph 94 proceedings the zipper program and its source code are available for research and commercial use free of charge as described at the bottom of this web page the software was written by greg turk this software distribution was prepared by hua grace ge and brian curless if you re interested in this package then you might also be interested in vrippack and scanalyze vrippack uses zipper for aligning meshes but uses a volumetric method for combining them rather than a mesh based method in many cases the volumetric approach is more robust scanalyze is a user interface for vrippack if you re only interested in reading ply files look at the file format section of the stanford 3d scanning repository web page table of contents zippack software distribution zippack sample dataset zipper documentation zipper mailing list stanford computer graphics laboratory home page zippack software distribution the current release of zippack is version 1.14 there are three independent pieces of the release which you can retrieve by clicking on the headings in the following list these items are available by clicking on the links below zipper 1500 k bytes compressed compressed tar file containing the source code and an executable file zipper which is compiled for sgi irix 5.3 save it as zipper 1.14 tar z and type zcat zipper 1.14 tar z tar xf to unpack the source or if your web browser automatically uncompresses files then use cat instead of zcat then look at the readme file in the unpacked source for further instructions ply 31k bytes compressed compressed tar file containing routines for reading and writing the ply polygon file format the zipper program reads individual polygon meshes stored as ply files and writes zippered polygon meshes as ply file as well the software here provides user the ability to read and write the individual and zippered meshes save it as ply 1.1 tar z and type zcat ply 1.1 tar z tar xf to unpack the source or if your web browser automatically uncompresses files then use cat instead of zcat then look at the readme file in the unpacked source for more information zippack is currently unsupported and is offered to the research community as is you are welcome to report bugs to zipper graphics stanford edu but we cannot guarantee that we will fix them in a timely manner another site with information about ply files is the ply file format page of the georgia institute of technology's large geometric models archive zippack sample dataset sample data of a telephone handset and a clay bunny are provided here they are in the ply file format containing both range images and polygon meshes click here for more datasets see the stanford 3d scanning repository zippack documentation zipper user's manual zipper mailing list we welcome questions suggestions comments and bug reports from users of the zippack software however we do not guarantee timely responses to them in particular the developers have long since graduated and left stanford email should be sent to zipper question at graphics dot stanford dot edu distribution notice copyright 1995 the board of trustees of the leland stanford junior university all rights reserved during the period 1995 2007 this software was covered by the stanford computer graphics laboratory's custom written general software license this license is royalty free nonexclusive and nontransferable click here to view its terms and conditions in modification of these terms and conditions users were permitted to distribute or sell derivatives of this software without accounting to stanford or the developers and without payment of royalties to stanford or the developers however title and copyright to the software and documentation remained with stanford and users were required to acknowledge the contribution of stanford in any derivatives as detailed in the license for downloads beginning on august 23 2007 this software is covered by a new general software license which is based on the bsd license last update august 1 2010 12 47 01 pm
