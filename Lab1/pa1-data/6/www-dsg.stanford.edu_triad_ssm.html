single source multicast multi source application support using single source multicast overview ip multicast still faces considerable address allocation and scalability challenges a decade after its inception inhibiting the deployment of large scale multimedia applications such as internet tv explicitly requested single source express multicast is a recent proposal that addresses many of these issues but it removes multi source multicast primitives from the network layer many multicast applications are multi source even those that logically have a single sender because of the use of rtcp and thus are not directly supported by the express model the premise of this work is that large scale multi source multicast sessions can be supported efficiently in a network with only single source multicast primitives through the use of application level relays these relays subsume the functionality of network level rendezvous points and since they exist at the application layer application level knowledge can be used to determine the placement of relays on a per session basis determine the specific relay s to be used on a per client basis and allow relay points to enforce dynamic floor control decisions
