introduction methodology results lessons learned discussion page 1 the frosh effect rd cases introduction basics in order to accommodate the demand for first year students to live among members of their incoming class stanford moved to a frosh clustering model for academic year of 2009 2010 this resulted in over two thirds of the freshmen class living in either wilbur hall or stern hall the move has since left some wondering what if any changes have resulted in the frosh experience due to frosh clustering will first year students behave differently now that they are clustered in wilbur and stern hall if so how this project explored one small component of the broader construct called the freshman experience background what follows outlines the changes in number and kind of residence dean cases as documented in the rd database for houses that transitioned from housing members of all four classes to exclusively housing first year students residence dean cases include any instances related to managing student crisis or conduct methodology overview the residence dean database houses over 9000 case files from academic year 2001 to the present the database is shared by all residence deans including those that work with graduate students via the graduate life office with the help of joyce li student affairs system software developer we were able to query the database directly and download a summary of all existing cases this helped us avoid errors associated with running complex searches via the existing web interface this large csv file was then formatted and standardize to adjust for human error associated with data entry this task involved separating undergraduate student cases from graduate student cases using incident dates to drive aggregates for academic years quarters and collapsing redundant case types like roommate issues conflicts and housing roommate issues conflicts the graphs on the left represent a summary of all cases related to the six houses that transitioned from four class to all frosh between academic years 2008 2009 and 2009 2010 results 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 01 02 02 03 03 04 04 05 05 06 06 07 07 08 08 09 09 10 number of rd cases academic year sep aug burbank serra twain arroyo soto trancos all frosh 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 01 02 02 03 03 04 04 05 05 06 06 07 07 08 08 09 09 10 number of rd cases academic year sep aug academic financial aid leave of absence alcohol drugs housing roommate issues conflicts medical psychological personal all frosh lessons learned effect on quantity from 2001 2002 to 2008 2009 the average number of rd cases in these six houses ranged from 11 18 with a standard deviation from 3 6 cases per year in 2009 2010 only one house burbank saw a significant difference in total number of rd cases there the number of cases dropped from 17 the previous year to 7 two standard deviations away from the mean in sum the change from four class to all frosh did not seem to have a significant impact on the volume of rd cases effect on kind there were two significant changes in the kind of cases seen in these houses with the change from four class to all frosh first there was a significant increase in the number of alcohol drug related cases with an average of 10 cases per year and a standard deviation of 3 cases the jump in 2009 2010 to 24 cases is almost 4 standard deviations away from the mean second there was a significant decrease in the number of medical psychological personal cases with an average of 31 per year and a standard deviation of 7 cases the drop to 15 is significant discussion questions for further exploration given the increase in alcohol drug cases and the decrease in medical psychological personal cases what factors are at play what about this housing configuration seems to simultaneously promote healthy habits in one dimension and unhealthy habits in another what other indicators might provide us insight with the impact of all frosh housing on the experience of our students will these patterns persist over time or was 2009 2010 an anomaly are there other patterns among houses based on the class make up of their residents what happens in houses that end up being majority seniors for example or more broadly do houses with younger students struggle with particular issues more than their older counter parts created by cisco barron residential education
