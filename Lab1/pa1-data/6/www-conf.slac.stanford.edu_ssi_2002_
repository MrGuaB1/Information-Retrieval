secrets of the b meson ssi2002 home past summer institutes why are there three generations what mechanisms underlie the pattern of quark masses mixing angles and cp violation the b meson's relatively large mass yet long lifetime gives it a special role in unraveling these mysteries as well as many other aspects of flavor physics and physics beyond the standard model recently b mesons have begun to be produced copiously at both e e and hadron colliders leading to the establishment of cp violation in b decays and a wealth of additional results the 2002 slac summer institute will review the basic physics the rapid recent progress and the exciting future prospects for studies of b mesons charmed particles and kaons which complement each other very nicely general information the 30th slac summer institute was held in the panofsky auditorium at the stanford linear accelerator center from august 5 16 2002 the institute began with seven days of pedagogical lectures designed for beginning post doctoral experimentalists and theorists and advanced graduate students it concluded with a three day topical conference the daily schedule consisted of lectures each morning and study and discussion sessions every afternoon social activities and student poster sessions were planned for the evenings and there was a tour to lick observatory mid institute the slac summer institute is hosted by stanford university and co sponsored by the us department of energy and the stanford linear accelerator center slac is located west of the stanford campus and approximately 33 miles south of san francisco the proceedings is available from the econf proceedings archive contact maura chatwell ssi 2002 coordinator stanford linear accelerator center 2575 sand hill road ms 81 menlo park ca 94025 usa ph 650 926 4931 fax 650 926 2525 email ssi slac stanford edu
