telemanipulation dexterous manipulation laboratory dextrous telemanipulation project humans have a wealth of experience in manipulation tasks but there are situations where it is infeasible or unsafe to place a human ie other planets deep sea or hazardous environments dexterous telemanipulation enables a user to interact with the environment from a safe location our goal is to develop a telemanipulation system that allows a person to control a dexterous robotic hand in an intuitive manner to achieve this we use the cyberglove grasp to control a dexterous robotic hand our research has focused on calibrating the cyberglove to an individual user and methods for mapping the human hand motion to robotic hand motion currently we are integrating concepts from dexterous manipulation to develop a supervisory autonomous control strucuture additionally we are developing robust tactile sensing capabilities and new tactile display devices this material in part is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no 0099636 any opinions findings and conclusions or recomendations expressed in this material are those of the author s and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation nsf news and archives this page was last modified on 3 28 02 if you have any questions regarding the website or the content please contact the
