metropolis light transport image three teapots metropolis light transport reference eric veach and leonidas j guibas siggraph 97 proceedings august 1997 addison wesley pp 65 76 images too dark try the gamma corrected pages there is also more information on gamma correction abstract we present a new monte carlo method for solving the light transport problem inspired by the metropolis sampling method in computational physics to render an image we generate a sequence of light transport paths by randomly mutating a single current path eg adding a new vertex to the path each mutation is accepted or rejected with a carefully chosen probability to ensure that paths are sampled according to the contribution they make to the ideal image we then estimate this image by sampling many paths and recording their locations on the image plane our algorithm is unbiased handles general geometric and scattering models uses little storage and can be orders of magnitude more efficient than previous unbiased approaches it performs especially well on problems that are usually considered difficult eg those involving bright indirect light small geometric holes or glossy surfaces furthermore it is competitive with previous unbiased algorithms even for relatively simple scenes the key advantage of the metropolis approach is that the path space is explored locally by favoring mutations that make small changes to the current path this has several consequences first the average cost per sample is small typically only one or two rays second once an important path is found the nearby paths are explored as well thus amortizing the expense of finding such paths over many samples third the mutation set is easily extended by constructing mutations that preserve certain properties of the path eg which light source is used while changing others we can exploit various kinds of coherence in the scene it is often possible to handle difficult lighting problems efficiently by designing a specialized mutation in this way additional information pdf of full paper 3446k compressed postscript of full paper 6020k postscript of full paper with low resolution grayscale images 2370k postscript of paper with no images 1340k figure 5 indirect lighting through a narrow opening a bidirectional path tracing jpeg 246k b metropolis light transport using the same computation time jpeg 111k figure 6 caustics viewed at several magnifications jpeg 337k compares metropolis light transport with bidirectional path tracing using the same computation time figure 7 caustics in a pool of water viewed indirectly through the ripples on the surface a path tracing jpeg 177k b metropolis light transport using the same computation time jpeg 120k if the images are too dark try the gamma corrected pages all jpeg images were compressed using a quality setting of 90 return to other recent papers from stanford last modified june 17 1997 eric veach
