update on grb tool development update on grb tool development cut and pasted from d band e mail 6 feb 2005 1 james and i worked on putting s n time binning into gtbin james has a few details to clean up but the method is in and has been tested 2 james and i worked on getting gtbin to read gbm data in its current incarnation the tool wasn t structured to handle data that is already binned so james has to do some restructuring 3 i ve had more discussions with rob about the formatting of the gbm data files friday i succeeded in formatting the continuous data 4 valerie visited gsfc and we discussed the gbm simulations for dc2 i described what i will produce and the inputs that i need 5 the gbm team will provide rmfit the idl based burst system while the ftools based system will allow the user to perform basic spectral analysis rmfit will also be able to fit lat and gbm data 6 the gbm team will provide background fits for the gbm bursts these will be both a simple background spectrum and channel by channel polynomial fits since this background information will be provided in the gbm burst data package there will not be a separate ftool to create new backgrounds by fitting continuous data before and after the burst if someone really wants to do such a fit they can use rmfit 7 jay has been working on including a pulse fitting routine in the burst temporal analysis packaged his routine operates on binned data and he is after me to extend it to unbinned data
