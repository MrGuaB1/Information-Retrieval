compiling your first c program compiling your first c program you have to first set up your environment assuming that ncihome is set to the home for nci codes you need to include ncihome solib in your ld_library_path and ncihome bin in your path for example here are the tcsh commands for setting these variables setenv ld_library_path ncihome solib ld_library_path setenv path ncihome bin path the c2s program generates suif2 files from c source files it takes only one argument the c source file for example cat test c test c a simple c program include int main int argc char argv int a b a argv 0 0 b &a printf d d n a b return 12 d c2s test c ls test c test suif out il the resulting suif file bears the suif extension in general most of them time is spent poking and prodding the suif file when you are finished and ready to generate binary code you can use the s2c pass the s2c pass generates c code from a suif file this c code can be run through gcc or the solaris cc compiler to generate object files and executables for example suifdriver e import s2c load test suif s2c d arch sunos test out c gcc o test test out c test 46 268437772 constantine sapuntzakis last modified thu oct 28 11 41 34 pdt 1999
