creating ntuples from your root analysis creating ntuple file from your root analysis one uses the tntuple class to create the ntuple and can create it in any of the histogram definition member functions of roottreeanalysis eg in reconcalhistdefine one could have the ntuple definition tntuple ctuple new tntuple ctuple ntuple for cal threshold studies run event edepmc edepcal mcfx mcfy mcfz in this example an ntuple named ctuple is created with 7 columns run event etc as for the roottreeanalysis histograms one has to get the pointer to the ntuple so in the analysis part of your code fill all the ntuple columns at the same time tntuple getobjectptr ctuple fill reconrunnum reconeventid etotcal c getenergysum mctermx mctermy mctermz the ntuple is contained in the default histogram file so when you write that out you ll get the ntuple along with it in root cint analysis you can examine your ntuple as in tfile f new tfile myhistos root ctuple draw edepcal r dubois last modified 2010 06 01 15 46 11 0700
