volume renderings volume renderings this page shows some mostly old results from our volume rendering research project for some really old volume renderings look at marc levoy's 1988 ieee cg&a paper display of surfaces from volume data to look at results from our other projects browse through our list of current research projects or you can return to our home page visualization for radiation treatment planning click on the image above to see a full size version click here to see an mpeg movie 162k bytes description this image suggests one possible way in which volume rendering might be used to assist clinicians plan radiation treatment for cancer patients the image is a volume rendering of a 256 x 256 x 109 voxel magnetic resonance mr scan of a live human subject a polygonally defined target volume in purple and three treatment beams in red have been added using a hybrid ray tracer capable of handling both polygon and volume data a portion of the volume has been clipped away and the raw mr values have been mapped onto the exposed surfaces this is a sample visualization not a clinical study the mr data and treatment plan were taken from two different patients credits the image was generated by marc levoy and victoria interrante working under the supervision of stephen m pizer and henry fuchs of the university of north carolina at chapel hill the mr data is courtesy of siemens ag and was edited by julian rosenman of north carolina memorial hospital who also created the treatment plan the mr data is available in the stanford volume data archive visualization of isoelectron density surfaces around molecules click on the images above to see full size versions click here to see an mpeg movie 165k bytes description volume rendering of two concentric isovalue contour surfaces from a 24 x 20 x 11 voxel portion of an electron density map for staphylococcus aureus ribonuclease to enhance comprehension of the outer surface its opacity in the leftmost image alternates between complete transmission and complete attenuation based on the value of a solid texture containing a honeycomb of small rectangular cells creating a burlap sack effect in the rightmost image this modulation of opacity is suppressed and the shape of the outer surface becomes harder to see credits the image was generated by marc levoy working under the supervision of stephen m pizer and henry fuchs of the university of north carolina at chapel hill the data is courtesy of dr chris hill university of york references marc levoy display of surfaces from volume data ieee computer graphics and applications vol 8 no 3 may 1988 pp 29 37 marc levoy a hybrid ray tracer for rendering polygon and volume data ieee computer graphics and applications vol 10 no 2 march 1990 pp 33 40 levoy m fuchs h pizer sm rosenman j chaney el sherouse gw interrante v kiel j volume rendering in radiation treatment planning proc first conference on visualization in biomedical computing ieee computer society press atlanta georgia may 1990 pp 4 10 marc levoy levoy m photorealistic volume rendering in scientific visualization siggraph 91 photorealistic volume modeling and rendering techniques course notes las vegas nevada july 1991 pp 2 1 2 13 1999 marc levoy last update february 19 2006 11 31 42 pm
