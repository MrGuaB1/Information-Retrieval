stem cell primer page 1 stanfordmedicinesprin g 2 0 0 4 the basics what's a stem cell a stem cell is a master cell that can create the more specialized cells in an animal or human stem cells from human embryos have the potential to create any type of hu man cell stem cells from mature humans often called adult stem cells can create only a subset of cell types for example blood forming stem cells can make blood cells but not brain or liver cells what's a cell line a cell line is a population of identical cells that all originated from a single cell be cause cell lines multiply scientists can grow the cells for their own research and to share with colleagues what's at stake government funding restrictions set in 2001 thwart attempts to use stem cells to de velop cures and to learn more about how humans develop a bill supported by pres ident bush and passed twice by the house of representatives would criminalize the creation or use of new stem cell lines with a $1 million fine and 10 years in jail what's the controversy the stem cells that many scientists consider especially promising for research and medicine come from early stage embryos called blastocysts however the harvesting process destroys the blastocyst leading some people to liken the procedure to the taking of a life what does stem cell research have to do with cloning the only connection is that creating a new line of stem cells and attempting to clone an animal have the same first steps re placing the nucleus of an egg cell with the nucleus of a mature human cell and stimu lating that egg to form a blastocyst research by studying how embryonic stem cells develop into mature cells such as those that make up our bone blood and skin re searchers can learn how those cells function and what goes wrong when they are diseased therapy doctors hope to use embryonic stem cells to replace cells dam aged from injury or disease this approach could help pa tients with conditions including alzheimer's or parkinson's dis eases or spinal cord injury disease study researchers can use embryonic stem cell lines derived from peo ple with genetic diseases such as diabetes cardiovascular disease or various types of cancers to better understand and treat the diseases the why of it the embryonic stem cells currently available to most scientists are close to useless they fall short for research because they carry the genes of only a narrow cross section of people they re inadequate for disease study because they re from healthy people and as a result lack the mutations predisposing people to most illnesses they are potentially dangerous for use in therapy because they have been exposed to contamination by mouse viruses given these limitations scientists would prefer to use nuclear transfer to customize new embryonic stem cell lines for research and therapy making embryonic stem cells the how of it nuclear transfer remove nucleus egg cell from adult tissue such as skin liver or breast stem cell primer everything you wanted to know about stem cells but were afraid to ask stimulate egg to divide new embryonic stem cell line inject nucleus into egg in three to five days the egg develops into a sphere called a blastocyst its inner cells are stem cells greg mably
