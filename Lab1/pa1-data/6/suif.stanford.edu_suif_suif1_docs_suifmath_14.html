the suifmath library constraint math go to the previous next section constraint math assume a b and c are of the class constraint x i and j are integers and o is a boolean x a i a i y read and modify the i th element of the constraint a the first element is the constant the subsequent elements are coefficients o a b are rows a and b are identical is also available c a b add the corresponding elements of the two constraints a and b and put the results in c c a b subtract the corresponding elements of the two constraints a and b and put the results in c c a b multiply the corresponding elements of a and b and put the results in c c a add the corresponding elements of a to the row c c a subtract the corresponding elements of a from the row c c a multiply the elements of c by the corresponding elements of a c a x add the integer x to each element of a and put the results in c c a x subtract the integer x form each element of a and put the results in the row c c a x multiply each element of a by the integer x and put the results in the row c c a x divide each element of a by the integer x and put the results in the row c c x add the integer x to each element of c c x subtract the integer x from each element of c c x multiply each element of a by the integer x c x divide each element of a by the integer x a b complement a b complement the constraint the complement of the constraint a 0 is a 0 i a row_lcm find the largest common multiplier of all the elements of the constraint i a row_gcd find the greatest common divisor of all the elements of the constraint i a rank return the position of the highest column with a non zero value i a unique only one non zero variable a 0 is the constant i a highest_order b return an integer val st for all locations x of a if a x 0 then val b c go to the previous next section
