higher bandwidth x higher bandwidth x john danskin acm multimedia 1994 abstract network bandwidth has always been a key issue for multimedia protocols many potential users of networked multimedia protocols will continue to have low bandwidth network connections for some time copper wire isdn infra red cellular modems etc compression provides potential relief for users of slow networks by increasin effective bandwidth hbx introduces a new technique based on arighmetic coding and statistical modeling for compressing structured data applied to the x networked graphics protocol this technique yields 4.5 1 compression across a representative set of traces performing twice as well as the popular lzw based xremote compression protocol hbx's coding techniques are generally applicable to the graphics and imaging subset of multimedia protocols future work will determine whether hbx's coding techniques can be applied to audio and video streams as well additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper 664k back up to papers index
