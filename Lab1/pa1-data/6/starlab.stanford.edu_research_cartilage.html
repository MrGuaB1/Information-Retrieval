research_cartilage mechanical properties of cartilage researchers gary beaupre katy keenan lampros kourtis derek lindsey thor besier cartilage is a complex tissue capable of withstanding large compressive loads during everyday activities determining the mechanical properties of articular cartilage is important for understanding how the tissue behaves in vivo how the tissue properties might change with age injury or disease and also how we might try to replicate the function of cartilage using tissue engineered constructs many researchers have investigated ways in which to test the material properties of cartilage and described cartilage using different material models the purpose of this research is to develop a robust and computationally efficient method to calculate cartilage material properties using creep or stress relaxation indentation experiements for more information please visit our va squish website
