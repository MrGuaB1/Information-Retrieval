figure earth's energy balance figure details of earth's energy balance source kiehl and trenberth 1997 numbers are in watts per square meter of earth's surface and some may be uncertain by as much as 20 the greenhouse effect is associated with the absorption and reradiation of energy by atmospheric greenhouse gases and particles resulting in a downward flux of infrared radiation from the atmosphere to the surface back radiation and therefore in a higher surface temperature note that the total rate at which energy leaves earth 107 w m 2 of reflected sunlight plus 235 w m 2 of infrared long wave radiation is equal to the 342 w m 2 of incident sunlight thus earth is in approximate energy balance in this analysis
