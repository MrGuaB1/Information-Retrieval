piezoelectric devices for the stretchable network page 1 piezoelectric devices for the stretchable network by nathan salowitz with help from dr sang jong kim & yu hung li advisor fu kuo chang page 2 background mems silicon based fabrication inadequate actuation potential too small for large scale shm bulk ceramic cannot be scaled down to appropriate sizes require discrete installation structures and composites lab nathan salowitz 300nm 300m page 3 problem statement develop an efficient piezoelectric transducer for structural state detection that is easy to fabricate en masse using micro fabrication compatible techniques and takes advantage of material properties structures and composites lab nathan salowitz page 4 approach mass fabrication screen printing can print an array of numerous pzts at once thicknesses from 10um to 100um can create complex patterns & designs structures and composites lab nathan salowitz page 5 challenges material properties material properties differ significantly between screen printed and bulk ceramic pzt of similar chemistry fabrication pzt must be sintered at 850 c causing many material issues structures and composites lab nathan salowitz page 6 multidisciplinary design electrical engineering electric field analysis and design classical mechanics analysis of mechanical deformation material science material development for fabrication elti fild li dt th eltd i 300 vl bi fild 967019 x 10 el ti fi ld li dt th el td i 300 v lb i fi ld 967019 x 10 new designs structures and composites lab nathan salowitz page 7 bio education bs university of wisconsin engineering mechanics ms stanford university aeronautics & astronautics experience boeing structural analyst hobbies sailing & windsurfing snowboarding structures and composites lab nathan salowitz
