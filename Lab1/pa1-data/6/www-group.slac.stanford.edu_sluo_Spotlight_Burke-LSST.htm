science collaboration opportunities with the large synoptic survey telescope the large synoptic survey telescope lsst is inviting members from the us astronomy and physics communities to take part in shaping the science for the lsst through membership in lsst science collaborations applicants may apply to join an existing collaboration or propose to form a new collaboration over the course of ten years the lsst will perform a six wavelength multi epoch optical survey of half the visible sky which will provide major leaps for studies of dark energy and dark matter via studies of gravitational lensing distant supernovae and the large scale distribution of galaxies the lsst will also enable large surveys to explore the structure and stellar populations of the milky way searches for faint solar system objects detection of optical transients among other topics the lsst will cover the sky with an unprecedented combination of speed and depth the particle physics project prioritization panel p5 which recently developed a long range plan for particle physics in the us explicitly endorsed the continued construction of the lsst under all funding scenarios that it considered more information about the lsst and its science goals can be found online at http www lsst org and http arxiv org abs 0805.2366 the science collaborations are opening their membership to the us science community to help develop and document the science opportunities provided by the lsst finalize the design of the system and observing strategy undertake end to end simulations commission instrument and data management systems and develop and ultimately perform science analyses these collaborations are intended to work closely with the lsst construction project although they are autonomous ventures those who wish to join an existing collaboration or initiate a new collaboration are invited to submit a proposal for review by an independent panel of astronomers and physicists coordinated by noao further details and information on applying for membership are available at http www noao edu lsst collab_prop scicollab htm the application deadline is september 21 2009 for those proposing to form a new collaboration we request that a letter of intent to apply that briefly describes the scientific topic and proposed membership be emailed to mhartman noao edu by august 15 2009 questions may be addressed to tod r lauer at lauer noao edu
