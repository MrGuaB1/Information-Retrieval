using plane parallax for calibrating dense camera arrays using plane parallax for calibrating dense camera arrays vaibhav vaish stanford university bennett wilburn stanford university neel joshi stanford university marc levoy stanford university proc of cvpr 2004 abstract a light field consists of images of a scene taken from different viewpoints light fields are used in computer graphics for image based rendering and synthetic aperture photography and in vision for recovering shape in this paper we describe a simple procedure to calibrate camera arrays used to capture light fields using a plane parallax framework specifically for the case when the cameras lie on a plane we show i how to estimate camera positions up to an affine ambiguity and ii how to reproject light field images onto a family of planes using only knowledge of planar parallax for one point in the scene while planar parallax does not completely describe the geometry of the light field it is adequate for the first two applications which it turns out do not depend on having a metric calibration of the light field experiments on acquired light fields indicate that our method yields than better results than full metric calibration image from one of the cameras synthetic aperture image using parallax based calibration paper adobe acrobat pdf 3.2 mb slides oral presentation 6.7 mb videos viewable by quicktime player in macs windows and xanim under linux students behind bushes using parallax based calibration students behind bushes using full metric calibration cyclist behind bushes
