spain the gold of spain back to index spain the gold of spain christopher jones says the investigations into the vanished gold reserves and juan negrin's role in their disappearance have been dominated by three historians angel vinas who now is working in brussels pablo martin acena and francisco olaya morales pablo martin acena's book disputes the claim by hugh thomas that the receipts for the gold were bequeathed to general franco at negrin's death according to martin acena the receipts were found in a safety deposit box in a paris bank if i am not mistaken it seems that the bullion was shipped from spain as payment for soviet military and humanitarian aid which is almost ludicrous given the appalling conditions republican refugees had to endure when they crossed into france in 1939 but i find luis araquistain's comment that negrin's government was the most cynical and despotic in the history of spain far more damning araquistain was the republic's ambassador to france from 1938 negrin took over the defence ministry and appointed communist party members to positions all over the military apparatus in particular marcelino fernandez to head the carabineros in the same year azana tried to oust negrin and was paid back when negrin would not consent to allow azana's friend cherif onto the plane which was to take them from france when the nazis defeated french forces in 1940 the modern socialist party psoe has been at times very cool toward the memory of negrin i recommend two books by the ex poumista francisco olaya morales el oro de negrin and la gran estafa ronald hilton 8 5 03 webmaster
