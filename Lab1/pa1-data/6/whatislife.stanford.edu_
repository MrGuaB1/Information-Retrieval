laboratory of cellular organization laboratory of cellular organization our group tries to answer these questions using a systems biology approach in which we integrate interacting networks of protein and lipids with the physical forces determined by the spatial geometry of the cell we use theoretical and computational techniques to make predictions that we can verify experimentally using synthetic chemical or genetic perturbations we primarily focus on bacteria in which the exquisite patterning of the interior in both space and time is critical for a wide variety of cellular functions the wide variety of shapes and sizes that bacteria take on can be used as synthetic environment for studying the establishment of intracellular organization and the cellular response to perturbations in morphology ultimately the manipulation of cell shape may provide a direct tool for engineering complex cellular behaviors currently we are interested in i the role of the cell wall in cell shape determination ii the regulation and mechanics of the cell cycle and cell division iii the spatial and temporal organization of the membrane iv the role of the membrane in transmembrane protein interactions and ion channel gating and v collective behavior in bacteria to read more about our research click here opportunities for information regarding positions as a rotation student graduate student or postdoc please contact kc huang at kchuang at stanford dot edu advertisements for postdoc positions here and here information for prospective students click to read how do cells grow how do cells determine their shape how do molecules inside cells get to the right place at the right time recent news tristan is the highest ranked stanford contributor at matlab central and 339 of 200000 overall kc and leon's pnas paper featured on dean's corner alex colavin joins the lab as a graduate student anchal joins the lab samantha joins the lab resources cluster information file server frontiers in quantitative biology c rocky mountain reflections photography inc kchuang lab 318 campus drive west clark center e372 stanford ca 94305
