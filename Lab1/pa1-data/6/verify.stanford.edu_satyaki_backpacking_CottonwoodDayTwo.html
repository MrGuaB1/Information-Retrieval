cottonwood lakes trip day 2 cottonwood lakes trip day 2 we got out of our tents pretty late in the morning we waited till the sun had managed to warm things up a bit here you can see us discussing whether we should be pushing on for the summit or not we decided wisely to do the summit some other time then we had oatmeal and hot chocolate for breakfast boiling water took forever because of the altitude we also had to thaw the ice in our water bottles then it was time to break camp we were running low on water well there was plenty of water in solid form around but we quickly discovered that melting it takes forever so we decided to refill our bottles from lake 3 instead when we got to the lake it turned out that there was a layer of ice on top of it so we broke it and got water from underneath it in the pictures below there really is a layer of ice on the lake though it doesn t look like that we had already decided not to continue to the summit so we declared victory at lake 3 and started back on the way back nandi managed to step into one of the streams and got his shoes and socks wet in addition to spraining his ankle so we had to take a short break so that his shoes could dry in the sun here you can see him without his shoes finally we were back at the parking lot taking the customary after pictures then we drove down to lone pine and had a hearty if late lunch at a mexican restaurant i had a really nice mexican soft drink called jarritos then we drove back home prev cottonwooddayone satyaki das last modified tue nov 4 13 01 33 pst 2003
