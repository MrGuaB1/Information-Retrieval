x ray lab template the philips x pert pro x ray diffraction system is the basic platform for a wide variety of application in analytical x ray diffraction the following applications are possible with x pert diffractometer high resolution rocking curve analysis reciprocal space mapping and x ray topography on epitaxial layers on single crystal substrates reflectometry on thin layers and substrate materials analysis of small spots on inhomogeneous samples phase analysis of samples with flat or irregular surfaces of thin films and of samples in glass capillaries quantitative phase analysis on batches of samples crystallography and rietveld analysis on samples with flat or irregular surfaces or powder samples in glass capillaries residual stress analysis of flat samples or irregularly shaped specimens in plane diffraction on thin films currently not available the modular design of x pert pro utilizes the prefix concept that makes possible to perform more than one analysis on one system prefix stands for pre aligned f ast i nterchangeable x ray modules prefix modules and accessories are factory aligned so they can be dismounted from the system and then mounted again without the need for system alignment by the user prefix enables to reconfigure the system from one application setup to another within a few minutes without the need for additional system alignment
