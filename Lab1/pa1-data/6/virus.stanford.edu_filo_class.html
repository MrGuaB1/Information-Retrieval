ebola classification and taxonomy ebola classification and taxonomy ebola sudan ebola zaire ebola cote d ivoire and ebola reston are the four known strains subtypes of ebola ebola and marburg are the only members of the filovirus family filoviruses ebola are helical non segmented negative single stranded rna viruses polymorphic noninfectious and have variable lengths infectious ebola virions are usually 920 nm in length 80 nm in diameter and have a membrane stolen from the host cell by budding the virus encodes for a nucleoprotein a glycoprotein 7 polypeptides a polymerase and 4 other undesignated proteins these proteins are made from polyadenylated mrna transcribed in the host cell from the virus rna takada a et al a system for functional analysis of ebola virus glycoprotein pnas 1997 197 14764 14769 diagram of ebola replication in a host cell the known morphological differences amongst the ebola viruses are ebola sudan median unit lengths of ebos virions range from 974 to 1063 nm 1 ebola zaire median unit lengths of eboz virions range from 990 to 1086 nm 1 diagram of ebola zaire genome ebola reston median unit lengths of ebor virions range from 1026 to 1083 nm 1 other morphological differences amongst the strains remains to be discovered they are very difficult to distinguish from each other and are known to cross react 2 references geisbert tw and pb jahrling differentiation of filoviruses by electron microscopy virus research 39 1995 129 150 crusberg ted personal communication ebola phylogenetic tree image from georges courbot isolation and phylogenetic characterization of ebola viruses causing different outbreaks in gabon 1999 tara waterman
