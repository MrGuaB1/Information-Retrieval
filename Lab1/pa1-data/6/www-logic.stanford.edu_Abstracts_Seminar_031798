thomas strahm recent results in metapredicative proof theory metapredicativity is a new general term in proof theory which describes the analysis and study of formal systems whose proof theoretic strength is beyond the feferman schuette ordinal gamma 0 but which are nevertheless amenable to predicative methods in this talk we give a general survey and introduction to metapredicativity in particular we discuss various examples of metapredicative systems including i subsystems of second order arithmetic ii first and second order fixed point theories iii extensions of kripke platek set theory without foundation and iv systems of explicit mathematics with universes relevant keywords for our talk are arithmetical transfinite recursion and dependent choice restricted bar induction transfinite hierarchies of fixed points transfinite fixed point recursion hyper inaccessibility mahloness and pi 3 reflection without foundation universe operators
