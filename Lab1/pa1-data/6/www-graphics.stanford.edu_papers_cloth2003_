simulation of clothing with folds and wrinkles simulation of clothing with folds and wrinkles robert bridson stanford university sebastian marino industrial light magic ronald fedkiw stanford university industrial light magic in sca 2003 abstract clothing is a fundamental part of a character's persona a key storytelling tool used to convey an intended impression to the audience draping folding wrinkling stretching etc all convey meaning and thus each is carefully controlled when filming live actors when making films with computer simulated cloth these subtle but important elements must be captured in this paper we present several methods essential to matching the behavior and look of clothing worn by digital stand ins to their real world counterparts novel contributions include a mixed explicit implicit time integration scheme a physically correct bending model with potentially nonzero rest angles for pre shaping wrinkles an interface forecasting technique that promotes the development of detail in contact regions a post processing method for treating cloth character collisions that preserves folds and wrinkles and a dynamic constraint mechanism that helps to control large scale folding the common goal of all these techniques is to produce a cloth simulation with many folds and wrinkles improving the realism pdf 1.6 mb example movie quicktime mpeg 4 7mb
