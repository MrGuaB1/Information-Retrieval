william lockman university of california santa cruz santa cruz institute for particle physics overview i am honored to be nominated by my colleagues to the slac users organization sluo executive committee sluo has traditionally represented high energy physics hep users at slac with slac broadening its mission into particle astrophysics and photon science sluo's role is also following this change in emphasis as an experimental particle physicist currently working on babar and atlas i would like to see sluo play an active role in helping to foster the development of both accelerator and non accelerator based particle physics at slac and in the broader user community brief background i received my ph d from ucla in 1978 on inclusive measurements of delta 1236 production and tests of one pion exchange at the cern intersecting storage rings in 1994 i joined the babar experiment and from 1997 to 2001 coordinated the development and deployment of the babar detector simulation program based on geant4 my physics activities on babar have concentrated on searching for for d0 anti d0 mixing a process which is highly suppressed in the standard model of particle physics experimental evidence of non zero mixing at the 1 level might indicate new physics non zero cp violating asymmetries would be a very strong indicator of new physics we published first evidence for d0 anti d0 mixing in d0 to k+ pi decays in spring 2007 but to date have seen no evidence for cp violation in mixing or decay i am continuing to search for additional evidence of d0 anti d0 mixing in other decay channels i am also an active member of the atlas collaboration from ucsc and have been elected chair of the atlas tier 2 users advisory committee plans as a member of the sluo executive committee i would work to ensure that there is continued support for accelerator base particle and particle astrophysics at slac this includes having continued support at slac for users in these disciplines including computing resources and office space availability for babar and atlas scientists i would also strive to improve the flow of information among scientists working in the various disciplines at slac if elected i would work with the public meetings subcommittee to help improve interdisciplinary communication at slac interdisciplinary communication is important but perhaps even more critical is communicating to the general public and to our congressional representatives a clear picture of what we do why it is relevant if elected i could serve on either the outreach or the washington dc trip subcommittee to help address these issues
