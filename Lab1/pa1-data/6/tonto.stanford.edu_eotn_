electrophysiology of the neuron announcing open access to electrophysiology of the neuron electrophysiology of the neuron is an interactive tutorial that comes with a computer disk for simulation of single neurons on a macintosh or ibm pc compatible computer it was available from oxford university press isbn 0 19 509167 1 mac and 0 19 509111 6 pc and is now out of print it was designed to be an adjunct to neurobiology 3rd edition by gordon shepherd but can also be used as a stand alone text news october 31 2008 we are pleased to announce that since the book is no longer in print we will be distributing both the book and the windows and the macintosh classic not os x versions of the software for free if you already have installed the commercial software that came with the book you can download complimentary upgrades for windows and macintosh versions of the software that comes with the book electrophysiology of the neuron windows versions these have poweruser options that allow additional features such as modifying the display editing the voltage dependent models etc click the following link to download the setup program that will upgrade a current windows version of eotn to the latest version one that includes support for windows printers and clipboard how to enable poweruser features in windows the instructions are briefly indicated in the online help under overview in windows 95 98 me 2000 xp you need to change the shortcut properties right click on the program icon then select properties select shortcut then target put the word poweruser after a space at the end of the line where the vcwin exe or ccwin exe is indicated click on ok macintosh poweruser version you can also download macintosh poweruser versions of the two programs please note these versions will only work if you have the previous version already loaded on your computer the download files are in binhex 4.0 format to install these programs on your computer download cclamp su and vclamp su now super user version of current clamp simulation program http super user version of vurrent clamp simulation program http movies of intracellular recordings we have found that it is very useful to see the activity of real neurons in order to get an intuitive feel for how neurons behave therefore we have included here some windows avi movie files with sound that you can download and watch the first movie illustrates a neuron similar to that simulated and illustrated in figure 21 of electrophysiology of the neuron this neuron is a human cortical pyramidal cell maintained in vitro the cortical pyramidal cell responds to a current pulse with the generation of a train of action potentials the frequency of which slows down over time a process known as spike frequency adaptation the second movie is the same neuron after the slow ca2+ activated k+ current i ahp is blocked with the local application of serotonin now the neuron generates less spike frequency adaptation and a higher frequency of neuronal discharge neurons in different parts of the brain generate different patterns of activity for example neurons in the thalamus behave quite distinctly from those in cerebral cortex as a comparison with the above movies of a cortical pyramidal cell download and watch this movie of the two states of activity in a thalamic relay neuron 4.4 megabytes these two states of activity are similar to those illustrated in figures 23 and 24 of electrophysiology of the neuron new simulations in this section we illustrate new simulations that can be run in windows versions directly from the www just set up your browser so that cc4 files will start up ccwin exe as a helper application and vc4 will start up vcwin exe here is a copy of a current clamp demo that illustrates spike frequency accomodation to show how you can interface ccwin with www and here is a voltage clamp demo to illustrate that the envelope of tail currents closely follows the envelope of the t current thank you for visiting the electrophysiology of the neuron web page visitor number comments or questions john huguenard or david mccormick john huguenard john huguenard stanford edu department of neurology and neurological sciences stanford university school of medicine stanford ca 94305 5300 david a mccormick david mccormick yale edu section of neurobiology yale university school of medicine 333 cedar street new haven ct 06510
