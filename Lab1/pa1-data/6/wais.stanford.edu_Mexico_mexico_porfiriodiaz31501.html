mexico porfirio diaz back to index mexico porfirio diaz elias castillo writes to know more about the bloody rule of the porfiriato barbarous mexico provides a truly horrifying description of life among the poor and the virtual death camps of the plantations in southeast mexico i managed to find a copy of this now rare book tucked away in the back of a palo alto used bookstore i m sure it was a major factor in throwing popular support in the us to the maderistas villa and zapata when the revolution was launched my comment this book 1911 by john kenneth turner is indeed rare only one library in the us is listed as having it it is not even mentioned in the bibliography of mexico in the area handbook series the fact that only one edition appeared makes me question whether it had much impact turner also wrote hand off mexico and a biography of pancho villa of which i can find only a spanish translation john reed had much more of an impact on americans through his firsthand reports on pancho villa's 1914 revolt which appeared in the magazine metropolitan the curious thing is that a number of translations of turner's book have appeared in mexico in the last decade or so indicating that unlike the american original it had a good sale there why probably some people were trying to discredit the us trained technicians brought in by president carlos salinas de gortari by implying that they were like the cientificos brought in by porfirio diaz perhaps it was a protest against nafta which like the diaz regime brought american capital flowing into mexico ronald hilton 3 15 01 webmaster
