pointing gestures culture and language pointing gestures culture and language david wilkins center for aphasia and related disorders va northern california health care system i would like to focus the discussion on two general questions 1 what is the relation between gesture and language and 2 how can we fruitfully explore this relationship cross culturally using field observations pointing provides a useful starting point for such a discussion for a couple of reasons first most cultures combine some form of pointing gesture with spatial language to form gesture speech composite signals still we know very little about how uniform or variable such composites are cross linguistically what is the relation between the information contributed by the gesture compared to the information provided in speech second pointing with the index finger has long been identified by many researchers as a gestural universal reflecting innate predispositions is this really the case my research with arrernte speaking communities in central australia suggests a real need to re examine what such a claim would actually mean my own experience is that as part of learning to speak arrernte i also had to re learn how to point and gesture properly i could no longer use my index finger point in ways that seemed natural to me even though index finger pointing is ubiquitous in the culture in my presentation i will use video to demonstrate some key cross cultural differences in pointing behavior main seminar page last modified wed sep 25 17 20 02 pdt 2002 by sgill turing stanford edu
