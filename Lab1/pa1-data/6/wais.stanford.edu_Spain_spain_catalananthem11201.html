spain the catalan anthem back to index spain the catalan anthem lluis bosch calls attention to the similarity between mexico's grito of hidalgo and the catalan anthem curious because one of the oldest catalanist slogans is precisely visca la terra i mori el mal govern ie long live our mother land and death to misgovernment or if preferred down with bad government this was a war cry of rebellious catalans as old as the 1640's in the unrest which led to the guerra dels segadors war of the reapers the first full blown catalan anti spanish rebellion and origin of the present catalan national anthem els segadors the reapers the same slogan was used consistently for the next two centuries until the advent of carlism liberalism and republicanism by the way some academics here and abroad claim that els segadors is the oldest national anthem in europe and some even say in the world certainly its mid seventeenth century origins are a proven fact but i am dubious about the claim of it being the oldest living national anthem it seems somewhat bizarre that the oldest national anthem should belong to a nation without a state structure to uphold and promote it can anybody shed some light on this are there any other ancient anthems to compete my comment i am sorry to disappoint lluis the catalan anthem calls on the peasants to cut the spanish oppressors down with their scythes it is similar to the marseillaise i believe that anthems should promote peace and not keep old hatreds alive ronald hilton 11 2 01 webmaster
