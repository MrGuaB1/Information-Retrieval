sources of uncertainty problems with data missing components or errors in the data noise in the data associated with biased or incomplete observations random sampling error and biases non representativeness in a sample problems with models known processes but unknown functional relationships or errors in the structure of the model known structure but unknown or erroneous values of some important parameters known historical data and model structure but reasons to believe parameters or model structure will change over time uncertainty regarding the predictability eg chaotic or stochastic behavior of the system or effect uncertainties introduced by approximation techniques used to solve a set of equations that characterize the model other sources of uncertainty ambiguously defined concepts and terminology inappropriate spatial temporal units inappropriateness of lack of confidence in underlying assumptions uncertainty due to projections of human behavior eg future consumption patterns or technological change which is distinct from uncertainty due to natural sources eg climate sensitivity chaos b ox examples of sources of uncertainty from moss and schneider 2000
