wais religion mithraism and buddhism march 2005 mithraism and buddhism we have discussed mithra steve torok who lives in buddhist thailand tells us that there is a mithraic buddha do you know that the future buddha that comes in about 2500 years is the mythraya buddha the current buddhist year is 2548 so we have another 2452 years to go with the current gutama buddha the mythraya buddha is usually depicted at the side of buddhist temples near the entrance and is a jolly fat figure contemplating his navel usually thought of as the god of prosperity rh i can find no reference to mythraya buddha but there is buddha maitreya the buddha of the future also known as the laughing buddha he waits in the tusita heaven for the moment he is to appear on earth as the buddha of the fifth world cycle at present he is considered as one of the dhyani bodhisattvas the creators of the universe in the future he will be like sakyamuni a mortal manusi buddha who lives on earth for a while in order to teach mankind the doctrine maitreya the loving one is widely worshipped in the himalayan regions he seems to have no relationship to mithra but since the cult of mithra spread so widely it must have reached india and influenced buddhism perhaps steve can tell us about buddhism in thailand and clarify this point ronald hilton 2005 top last updated april 13 2005
