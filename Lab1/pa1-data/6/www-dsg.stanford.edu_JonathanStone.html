jonathan's home page the public edition this is me ph d student oral defense completed march 20001 thesis completion expected june 2001 distributed systems group computer science department stanford university research interests my phd thesis researh is on checksums in the internet how often errors survive link level checks like crcs and are caught or worse fail to be caught by network or transport level checksums my data shows that the tcp checksum is catching to errors in 1 in 4000 packets leading to an expected rate of undetected errors of up to 1 in 10 million pending work based on my phd thesis is to develop internet rfcs to improve the behaviour of hosts detecting packets where the data and checksum disagree to report bad packets back to the source via an icmp parameter problem message other research interests come out of experience at narrowband audio where i engineered both a reliable low bandwidth streaming network protocol and the decoder side of a codec which streamd fm quality audio over a cdma cellphone link after experience working on this codec and switching between low bandwidth cdma streams and 801.11 or ethernet streaming i am also interested in connectivity aware applications capable of performing well in environments where due to either mobility or switching from wireless to wired networks available bandwidth can vary by 3 or more orders of magnitude both improving quality when better connectivity is available and graceful transition to lower quality service when that is the only option other interests include measurement and analysis of tcp performance over lossy links work on multicast and work with ntp including rfc 2783 resume a text only curriculum vitae is here selected publications when the checksum and the data disagree jonathan stone and craig partridge proc acm sigcomm 2000 stockholm sweden august 2000 performance of checksums and crcs over real data j stone m greenwald c partridge and j hughes ieee acm transactions on networking oct 1998 supporting mobility in mosquitonet mary g baker xinhua zhao stuart cheshire and jonathan stone proceedings of the 1996 usenix technical conference january 1996 j stone m greenwald s singhal and d cheriton designing an academic firewall policy practice and experience proceedings of the symposium on network and distributed system security february 1996 79 91 excerpted in on the internet vol 2 no 3 may june 1996 pages 24 29 performance of checksums and crcs over real data c partridge j hughes jonathan stone proceedings of sigcomm 95 boston massachusetts august 1995 previous research interests connection oriented extensions to ip in a previous incarnation of some of the ideas in the dsg's triad research project related interests networking operating systems distributed systems and a decaying interest in compilers hobbies having fun and in general having a life though graduate students aren t meant to sometime soon i ll get around to having a personal homepage with an on line photo album playing volleyball in the oval which is pictured in the stanford homepage is becoming a regular dsg activity compiler hacker stuff porting gnu cc c++ gas gdb to the pyramid 90x a now defunct risc architecture responsible for the netbsd kernel port to the pmax decstation architecture also responsible for the underlying mips architectural support used on all mips based netbsd ports windows ce sgi cobalt etc building kawaihiko the first academic internet in new zealand achieved by implementing ip forwarding snmp and the igrp protocol i286 based pcs connected via serial links interest in multicast i was one of the first people to obtain steve deering's original ip multicast code from stanford porting it to more bsd and 4.3 bsd reno fixing byteorder bugs and contributing fixes for numerous other bugs education ph d computer science stanford university 1993 in progress ms distinction computer science 1986 89 victoria university of wellington new zealand b sc computer science 1981 84 otago university victoria university new zealand new zealand is a really neat and beautiful place where i was fortunate enough to grow up though it's a long way away from california fortunately there re lots of neat on line aotearoan stuff including phiip greenspun's travelogue with lots of homesickness inducing pictures though none of glow worms and the homepage of a one time acquaintance from otago micheal witbrock who's graduated from c mu and is now back in dunedin my own photos from a vacation around new zealand's northern coast are apparently still in the postal system on their way to me these along with the dreary jpeg above are waiting for me to get some help from amy gale who makes a living crafting web pages and kindly condescends to point out the bugs in my html jonathan stone department of computer science gates building 4a stanford university stanford ca 94305 9040 fax 650 725 7398 jonathan at dsg dot stanford dot edu
