ksl 92 71 a translation approach to portable ontology specifications reference gruber t r a translation approach to portable ontology specifications 1993 abstract to support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among ai systems it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented a specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse definitions of classes relations functions and other objects is called an ontology this paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called ontolingua into specialized representations including frame based systems as well as relational languages this allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations we discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems one problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages remaining system independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems we describe how these problems are addressed by basing ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain independent representational idioms notes publisher academic press june full paper available as ps jump to ksl smi reports by author reports by ksl number reports by year send mail to ksl info ksl stanford edu to send a message to the maintainer of the ksl reports
