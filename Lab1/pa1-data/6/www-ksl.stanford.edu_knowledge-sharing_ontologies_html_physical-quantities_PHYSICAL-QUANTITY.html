class physical quantity in theory physical quantities class physical quantity defined in theory physical quantities source code physical quantities lisp slots on this class documentation a physical quantity is a measure of some quantifiable aspect of the modeled world such as the earth's diameter a constant length and the stress in a loaded deformable solid a measure of stress which is a function of three spatial coordinates the first type is called constant quantity and the second type is called function quantity all physical quantities are either constant quantities or function quantities although the name and definition of this concept is inspired from physics physical quantities need not be material for example amounts of money are physical quantities in fact all real numbers and numeric valued tensors are special cases of physical quantities in engineering textbooks quantities are often called variables physical quantities are distinguished from purely numeric entities like a real numbers by their physical dimensions a physical dimension is a property that distinguishes types of quantities every physical quantity has exactly one associated physical dimension in physics we talk about dimensions such as length time and velocity again nonphysical dimensions such as currency are also possible the dimension of purely numeric entities is the identity dimension the value of a physical quantity depends on its type the value of a constant quantity is dependent on a unit of measure physical quantities of the identity dimension dimensionless quantities are just numbers or tensors to start with physical quantities of the type function quantity are functions that map quantities to other quantities eg time dependent quantities are function quantities see the definitions of these other classes and functions for detail exhaustive subclass partition constant quantity function quantity slots on instances of this class quantity dimension slot cardinality 1 notes see also constant quantity function quantity physical dimension we define a general class of quantities in order to support a generic set of operators most of the semantics of these operators are not given here specializations of quantity will define how each operator works over their domains ie subclasses of quantity
