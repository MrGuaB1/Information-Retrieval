the suifmath library matrix math go to the previous next section matrix math this section describes the mathematical functions available on matrices the symbols a b and c are of the class integer_matrix x i and j are integers and b is a boolean x a i j a i j y read and modify element i j of matrix a a i b j update the i th row of a by the j th row of b b a b is matrix a and b are identical is also available c a b add the two matrices a and b and results in c c a b subtract the two matrices a and b and results in c c a b multiply matrices a and b and put results in the matrix c c a add a to matrix c c a subtract a from matrix c c a multiply c by the matrix a c a x add the integer x to each element of a and put results in c c a x subtract the integer x form each element of a and put results in the matrix c c a x multiply each element of a by the integer x and put results in the matrix c c a x divide each element of a by the integer x and put results in the matrix c c x add the integer x to each element of c c x subtract the integer x from each element of c c x multiply each element of a by the integer x c x divide each element of a by the integer x x a determinant x gets the determinant of a c a transpose matrix c gets the transpose of a c a inverse matrix c gets the inverse of a c a inverse &x matrix c gets the inverse of a and the integer x is the determinant go to the previous next section
