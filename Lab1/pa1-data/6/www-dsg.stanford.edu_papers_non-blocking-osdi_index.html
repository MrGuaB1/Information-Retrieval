the synergy between non blocking synchronization and operating system structure next contents next contents the synergy between non blocking synchronization and operating system structure michael greenwald and david cheriton gif computer science department stanford university stanford ca 94305 9040 abstract non blocking synchronization has significant advantages over blocking synchronization however it has not been used to a significant degree in practice we designed and implemented a multiprocessor operating system kernel and run time library for high performance reliability and modularity we used non blocking synchronization not because it was an objective in itself but because it became the approach of choice it was an attractive approach because of the synergy between other structuring techniques we used to achieve our primary goals and the benefits of non blocking synchronization this paper describes this synergy the structuring techniques we used which facilitated non blocking synchronization and our experience with this implementation contents list of figures introduction type stable memory management tsm data structures that minimize contention minimizing the window of inconsistency non blocking synchronization implementation the base approach dealing with multiple lists comparison to blocking synchronization non blocking synchronization primitives software implementation of dcas hardware contention control performance experimental implementation simulation based evaluation overall system performance related work lock free operating systems methodologies for implementing concurrent data objects hardware support operating system support concluding remarks acknowledgements references about this document michael greenwald thu sep 19 12 18 20 pdt 1996
