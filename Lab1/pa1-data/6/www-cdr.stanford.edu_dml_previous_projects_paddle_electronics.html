projects dexterous manipulation laboratory the haptic paddle electronics for the haptic paddle not included in the kit the motors are powered by small current amplifiers constructed from lm675 power operational amplifiers the circuit diagram is shown below with a power supply of 12 volts and a d a output of 5 volts the amplifiers generate a minimum current of 1.5 amps the maximum rating for this motor this results in a maximum motor torque of 0.035 nm which corresponds to a force of 7.5 n at the joystick handle electronic elements other parts 1 k ohm resistor heat sink for lm675 10 k ohm resistor nylon screw and nut to attach heat sink to lm675 2 x 1 uf capacitor screw terminals and molex connectors 22 uf capacitor non polar perf board for mounting components 0.33 ohm power resistor 3 watts power supply with 12 volts and 2 amps kit 1 ohm power resistor lm675 power op amp allison okamura allisono cdr stanford edu 1998
