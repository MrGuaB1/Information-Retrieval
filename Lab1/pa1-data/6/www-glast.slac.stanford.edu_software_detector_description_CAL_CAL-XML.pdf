xml geometry rotations and the cal page 1 16 aug 2002 j bogart 1 xml geometry rotations and the cal page 2 16 aug 2002 j bogart 2 csielement z y x segment 0 segment 1 segment 2 the standard csielement has its long axis in the x direction so is x measuring segment number increases as x increases page 3 16 aug 2002 j bogart 3 callayer z y x the callayer volume is made by stacking csielements in the y direction log number increases as y increases hence for callayer both segment indices and log indices increase in the proper direction log 0 log 1 log 2 segments 0 1 2 page 4 16 aug 2002 j bogart 4 callayer rotated 2 1 0 logs x seg 0 seg 2 seg 4 z y if callayer is rotated so that x goes to y the segment ordering increasing in the proper manner but the log indices are backwards this is not how the y measuring layers are created in the xml description page 5 16 aug 2002 j bogart 5 callayerymeas z log 0 log 1 log 2 y x segments 0 1 2 callayerymeas is made just the way callayer is namely by stacking csielement in y except that the log numbers are assigned in the reverse order unrotated callayerymeas has segment numbers increasing in x log numbers decreasing in y page 6 16 aug 2002 j bogart 6 callayerymeas rotated logs 0 1 2 x seg 0 seg 2 seg 4 z y if callayerymeas is rotated so that x goes to y the segment ordering increasing in the proper manner with increasing y and the log numbers increase with increasing x the xml description in use alternately stacks callayerymeas and callayer volumes
