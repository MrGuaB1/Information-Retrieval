hierarchical splatting a progressive refinement algorithm for volume rendering hierarchical splatting a progressive refinement algorithm for volume rendering david laur and pat hanrahan proceedings of siggraph 1991 abstract this paper presents a progressive refinement algorithm for volume rendering which uses a pyramidal volume representation besides storing average values the pyramid stores estimated error so an oct tree can be fit to the pyramid given a user supplied precision this oct tree is then drawn using a set of splats or footprints each scaled to match the size of the projection of a cell the splats themselves are approximated with rgba gouraud shaded polygons so that they can be drawn efficiently on modern graphics workstations the result is a real time rendering algorithm suitable for interactive applications additional information available compressed postscript version of the paper 556k eps rgb back up to papers index
