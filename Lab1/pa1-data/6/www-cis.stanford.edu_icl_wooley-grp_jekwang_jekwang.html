je kwang cho's research page low power high resolution sigma delta modulator for broadband a d conversion faculty bruce wooley student je kwang cho research summary the scaling of cmos technology makes it possible for complex digital signal process to consume less power operate at higher frequency and occupy less silicon area however the design of high speed high resolution adcs which is demanded by complex digital systems is becoming more difficult due to reduced supply voltage and worsening device matching the resolution of nyquist rate a d converters is typically limited to 10 to 12 bits by circuit nonlinearities and device mismatch in scaled cmos technology even if complex digital calibration is used in contrast oversampling a d converters based on sigma delta modulation can achieve significantly higher resolution by oversampling the input signal and shaping the quantization noise so as suppress quantization error in the signal band the objective of this research is to explore low power design techniques for both analog and digital circuits in a low voltage environment a newly proposed feedforward architecture for a cascade of two second order sigma delta modulators offers the potential for low power low voltage operation at signal bandwidths of several mhz low voltage operational amplifiers multi bit coarse a d conversion for quantization and feedback dac linearization can then be used to achieve more than 15 bit resolution even from supply voltages as low as 1 v or less education ph d candidate electrical engineering stanford university 2005 current ms electronics engineering korea university 2000 bs electronics engineering korea university 1998 contact information center for integrated systems 071 via ortega & via pueblo stanford university stanford ca 94305 4070 email jkcho stanford edu ic lab integrated circuits lab cis center for integrated systems stanford stanford university home people projects publications links e mail cis home page ic lab
