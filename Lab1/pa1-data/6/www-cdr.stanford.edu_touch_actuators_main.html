introduction to embedded actuators site embedded actuators for small robotic devices introduction this web site is dedicated to document research on actuators for robotic systems in particular the experimentation of creating small robot parts with actuators embedded within the structure itself as the scale of robotic devices decreases the complexity of fasteners for actuators increases creating small motor linkage assemblies becomes difficult when conventional parts and manufacturing methods are employed figure 1 illustrates the assembly of a small motor to a linkage shape deposition manufacturing sdm and other rapid prototyping methods provide the means to create more efficient biomimetic robotic devices devices that mimic biological systems by alternatively adding and removing materials layer by layer devices can be created with multiple materials heterogeneous material properties embedded components and complex three dimensional geometries such as cooling channels and internal cavities figure 2 shows a design for the leg of an insect like mobile robot employing conventional parts figure 3 shows a possible design for the same insect leg manufactured with embedded actuators and components this site contains literature survey contains descriptions of papers found in a literature survey on actuators specifically electro magnetic shape memory alloy polymer piezo electric hydraulic and pneumatic links prototype a prototype linkage with embedded actuators is currently being developed figure 1 motor linkage assembly example figure 2 insect leg design with conventional actuators and sensors figure 3 insect leg design with 3d exoskeleton
