digital camera simulation scien digital camera simulation from scien edit cmos imagers we use iset to simulate cmos imagers with different optical and sensor properties we then evaluate the output of the imaging sensors using a variety of different metrics we can also pass the sensor output through an image processing pipeline to generate images that can be used in visual psychophysical experiments in this section we record our efforts to simulate the output of the sensor array there are other sections that describe the image processing pipeline and visual psychophysical experiments an overview of iset and it's applications can be found in farrell et al comparing the performance of real and simulated sensors we simulate real cmos imagers and compare the predicted performance with measurements of the real imager iset simulations of cmos imagers with different sensor parameters we use the iset simulations to predict the performance of sensors that do not necessarily have real counterparts retrieved from http white stanford edu pdcwiki index php digital_camera_simulation views article discussion edit history personal tools create an account or log in o main page primer o software o iset o measurement o projects o oldprojects industry news display measurement dmtoolbox camera calibration hdr capture hyperspectral digital camera image classification cleartype experiments misprint detection synapse projects digital camera simulation interleaved imaging pixel binning demosaick denoise color balance ref estimation camera iq rgc simulation iset integrated color pixel spatial cielab cttoolbox display simulation user rights wiki tools instructions local edit side bar user rights view all pages view allspecial pages search mediawiki gnu free documentation license 1.2 this page was last modified 05 25 5 january 2010 this page has been accessed 570 times content is available under gnu free documentation license 1.2 about scien disclaimers
