learning seminar seminar on computational learning and adaptation the problem over the past decade research on computational approaches to learning and adaptation has emerged as a central topic in many disciplines including artificial intelligence molecular biology cognitive psychology complexity theory decision theory pattern recognition and statistics unfortunately researchers in these paradigms do not communicate as often as they might leading to duplicated effort and missed insights that can come from interdisciplinary exchange the response the seminar on computational learning and adaptation is designed to improve communication among the local researchers with interests in computational approaches to learning and adaption broadly defined talks cover a variety of methods case based learning decision tree induction genetic algorithms neural networks and probabilistic algorithms and take different approaches to evaluation applied experimental theoretical and psychological open discussion aims to establish a common language and increase the chances of future collaborations logistics during the fall quarter of 2002 2003 the seminar will usually meet in cordura 100 on thursdays from 4 15pm to 5 30pm cordura hall is one of csli's center for the study of language and information buildings on the corner of campus drive and panama street map to reach cordura 100 enter through the building's main doors which are opposite campus drive and adjacent to ventura hall turn right into a short hall that ends in the meeting room schedule for fall quarter 2002 date topic speaker september 26 2002 lessons for the computational discovery of scientific knowledge pat langley institute for the study of learning and expertise computational learning laboratory csli october 3 2002 constrained clustering for improved pattern discovery sepander kamvar department of scientific computing computational mathematics stanford university october 17 2002 lloyd clustering of gauss mixtures robert gray department of electrical engineering stanford university october 24 2002 to be announced dorrit billman school of psychology georgia institute of technology october 31 2002 november 7 2002 november 14 2002 november 21 2002 to be announced ioannis iglezakis daimlerchrysler ag research and technology november 28 2002 happy thanksgiving december 5 2002 related talk in symbolic systems forum linguistically rich statistical models of language math corner 4 15pm 380 380c joseph smarr december 12 2002 hierarchies of models toward understanding planetary nebulae kevin knuth computational sciences department code ic nasa ames research center please pass on this information to other local researchers who might be interested in participating if you would like to be added to the seminar mailing list or if you are interested in giving a talk in the seminar send email to sbay apres stanford edu past schedules spring quarter 2002 winter quarter 2002 fall quarter 2001 spring quarter 2001 winter quarter 2001 fall quarter 2000 spring quarter 2000 winter quarter 2000 fall quarter 1999 spring quarter 1999 winter quarter 1999 fall quarter 1998 spring quarter 1998 winter quarter 1998 return to computational learning laboratory home page
