the mutilated checkerboard in set theory page 1 the mutilated checkerboard in set theory john mccarthy computer science department stanford university jmc cs stanford edu http www formal stanford edu jmc april 27 2001 an 8 by 8 checkerboard with two diagonally opposite squares removed cannot be covered by dominoes each of which covers two rectilinearly adjacent squares we present a set theory description of the proposition and an informal proof that the covering is impossible while no present system that i know of will accept either the formal description or the proof i claim that both should be admitted in any heavy duty set theory 1 we have the definitions board z8 z8 1 mutilated board board 0 0 7 7 2 domino on board x x board card x 2 x1 x2 x x1 x2 adjacent x1 x2 3 and adjacent x1 x2 c x1 1 c x2 1 1 c x1 2 c x2 2 c x1 2 c x2 2 1 c x1 1 c x2 1 4 if we are willing to be slightly tricky we can write more compactly adjacent x1 x2 c x1 1 c x2 1 c x1 2 c x2 2 1 5 but then the proof might not be so obvious to the program next we have 1the mizar proof checker accepts the definitions essentially as they are but the first proof in mizar is 400 lines 1 page 2 partial covering z x x z domino on board x xy x z y z x y x y 6 theorem z partial covering z j z mutilated board 7 proof we define x board color x rem c x 1 c x 2 2 8 domino on board x uv u x v x color u 0 color v 1 9 partial covering z card u j z color u 0 card u j z color u 1 10 card u mutilated board color u 0 card u mutilated board color u 1 11 and finally z partial covering z mutilated board j z 12 qed 2
