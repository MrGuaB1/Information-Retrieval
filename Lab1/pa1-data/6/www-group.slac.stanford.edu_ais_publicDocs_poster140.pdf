microchannel flow boiling of co2 page 1 flow boiling of co2 is a very promising cooling process for future high energy physics par cle detectors including future 3d stacks in the lecture the highlights of my ongoing two phase flow boiling research in microchannels will presented illustrated by two phase flow videos in single channels and mul microchannel evaporators including some co2 videos in par cular the important aspects of microchannel flow boiling in microchannels will be discussed and also the weak points of our current predic on methods and what we are doing to improve them a brief overview of our cmosaic project on two phase cooling of future 3 dimensional computer chips in collabora on with ibm stacks of processors cooled internally by interlayer microchannels will be presented and used as an example of possible future direc ons discussion of 2d and 3d detectors microchannel flow boiling of co2 applica ons to 2d and 3d detector cooling http www group slac stanford edu ais advanced instrumentation seminars guest speaker prof john r thome swiss federal ins tute of technology in lausanne epfl february 9 2011 1 30 pm 3rd floor kavli meeting room
