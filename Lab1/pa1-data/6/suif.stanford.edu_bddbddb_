bddbddb bdd based deductive database bddbddb a bdd based deductive database john whaley christopher unkel and monica s lam stanford university jwhaley cunkel lam stanford edu abstract bddbddb is a tool for easily and efficiently specifying and querying program analyses we represent the program and analysis results in a deductive database implemented with binary decision diagrams binary decision diagrams bdds are a data structure that can efficiently represent large relations and provide efficient set operations they have recently been shown to be effective for whole program pointer analysis we demonstrate that they are applicable to other program analyses queries are specified as a program in datalog a standard declarative language for reasoning about relations our deductive engine automatically translates the datalog program into an optimized series of bdd operations we show that a logic database implemented with bdds is an efficient platform for program analysis indeed experimental results run on a variety of programs show that points to analysis implemented with our tool is typically faster than a handcoded version the latest version of bddbddb is currently available in the cvs repository accessible from the project page on sourceforge to generate the initial relations we use the joeq compiler infrastructure the joeq main genrelations class generates the initial relations for pointer analysis we are also working on an eclipse plugin so you can generate the initial relations directly from the eclipse ast if you are using or are interested in using bddbddb it would be great if you could drop me a line and let me know about it i am interested in knowing how people are using the system and i might actually have some insights that are useful thanks last modified august 2 2004 by jwhaley
