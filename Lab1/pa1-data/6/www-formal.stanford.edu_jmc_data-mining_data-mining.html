phenomenal data mining from data to phenomena next next introduction phenomenal data mining from data to phenomena john mccarthy computer science department stanford university stanford ca 94305 jmc cs stanford edu http www formal stanford edu jmc janfebmaraprmayjun julaugsepoctnovdec 10 0 abstract phenomenal data mining finds relations between the data and the phenomena that give rise to data rather than just relations among the data for example suppose supermarket cash register data does not identify cash customers nevertheless there really are customers and these customers are characterized by sex age ethnicity tastes income distribution and sensitivity to price changes a data mining program might be able to identify which baskets of purchases are likely to have been made by the same customers in this example the receipts are the data and the customers are phenomena not directly represented in the data once the baskets of purchases are grouped by customer the way is open to infer further phenomena about the customers eg their sex age etc this article concerns what can be inferred by programs about phenomena from data and what facts are relevant to doing this gif we work mainly with the supermarket example but the idea is general in order to infer phenomena from data facts about their relations must be supplied sometimes these facts can be implicit in the programs that look for the phenomena but more generality is achieved if the facts are represented as sentences of logic in a knowledge base used by the programs the result of phenomenal data mining might include an extended database with additional fields on existing relations and new relations thus the relations describing supermarket baskets might be extended with a customer field and new relations about customers and their properties might be introduced introduction phenomena in the world grouping supermarket purchases by customer minimizing anomaly in assignments of baskets to customers the customer as a stochastic process mail order bookstores proposed experiments the logic of phenomenal data mining ontology remarks acknowledgments references about this document john mccarthy thu apr 6 16 23 28 pdt 2000
