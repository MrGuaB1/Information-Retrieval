breadcrumbs for views pages breadcrumbs for views pages zc with permission from the author daniel hanold i am pasting in his documentation below of how to use views arguments to create customized breadcrumbs for views pages as of the time of this writing the custom breadcrumbs module does not seem to handle views breadcrumbs is a thoroughly stable fashion though it appears that it will so this information may soon be obsolete nevertheless i think the more we can do with views and other near core modules and resort to contrib less the better it's a solid piece of documentation thanks danny source http www danielhanold com story views breadcrumbs using arguments for most of my clients i need to create breadcrumbs seemingly easily breadbrumbs is an area that is a bit more involved than most features in drupal there's a great module out there called custom_breadcrumbs the module works great for the display of breadcrumbs on all node pages but doesn t yet work with views after doing some research about a solution for view pages here's my favorite pick views arguments for a simple overview page that uses views add a global null argument within that argument select provide default argument and select php code in here you can use the drupal_set_breadcrumb function that function accepts an array of link titles and paths here's an example breadcrumb l home null breadcrumb l is the box butler for me use cases drupal_set_breadcrumb breadcrumb to make this work it's important to select display all values for action to take if argument does not validate otherwise the view gets messed up to be on the safe side i ve attached a screenshot of the arguments code for this live example http theboxbutler com use cases
