cell cycle regulation carolina tropini caulobacter is a model organism for cell cycle regulation and development upon division it differentiates into a sessile stalked cell and a motile swarmer cell throughout the cell cycle the localization of several key proteins is highly regulated our goal is to address the importance of spatial localization in signal transduction and development flagellar pole development is controlled by the response regulator divk whose phosphorylation state is controlled by the kinase divj and the phosphatase plec plec localizes to the swarmer pole while divj localizes at the stalked pole through a collaboration with the newton lab at princeton we have constructed strains with a variety of plec and divj localization patterns our results indicate that localization is not absolutely necessary in this system but that rather localized proteins enhance the robustness to fluctuations in collaboration with the laub lab at mit we have also investigated the importance of spatial asymmetries in the regulation of the master cell cycle regulator ctra in its phosphorylated form ctra binds to the replication origin in caulobacter in a highly cooperative fashion and prevents dna replication the ctra distribution is tightly controlled not only by localized phosphorylation and dephosphorylation but also synthesis and degradation we found that physiological degradation rates exert only a small perturbation on the distribution generated by asymmetric phosphorylation back to research main page localization of phosphorylated divk blue and unphosphorylated divk green in caulobacter crescentus cell cycle regulation kchuang lab 318 campus drive west clark center e372 stanford ca 94305
