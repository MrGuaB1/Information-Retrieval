non blocking synchronization implementation next up previous contents next the base approach up the synergy between non blocking previous minimizing the window non blocking synchronization implementation with the structuring of the cache kernel and supporting class libraries described above non blocking synchronization is relatively simple to implement most data structures are collections of fixed size descriptors several collections are queues for service for example thread descriptors are queued in the ready queue and a delay queue of their associated processor other collections are lookup or search structures such as a hash table with linked list buckets for example we organize page descriptors into a lookup structure per address space supporting virtual to physical mapping for the address space the base approach dealing with multiple lists comparison to blocking synchronization michael greenwald thu sep 19 12 18 20 pdt 1996
