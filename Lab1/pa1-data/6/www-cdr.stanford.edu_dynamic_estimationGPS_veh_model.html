dynamic design lab projects dynamic desingn lab lab overview research directions people projects testbeds vehicle model for sideslip estimation the sideslip angle is defined by the angle between the velocity vector of the vehicle and the longitudinal axis the figure below shows a bicycle model where the left and right wheel are lumped into a single wheel and vehicle roll is neglected the sideslip angle is defined by beta cg which is also the inverse tangent of u y cg over u x cg bicycle model since the two antenna system is mounted on the vehicle roof see bottom figure the velocities measured by gps are influenced by the roll rate the accelerometers are also influenced by the extra gravity component when the vehicle has some roll component due to vehicle roll motion and or grade since the two antenna system gives us the total vehicle roll angle includes both vehicle roll and road grade it is possible to compensate for these effects and improve the sideslip estimation grade and roll effects sideslip estimation home
