live variable analysis next up previous next analysis of array up scalar parallelization analysis previous scalar parallelization analysis live variable analysis we solve a standard live variable problem interprocedurally through a two phase region based backward analysis in phase 1 the transfer function for each region is computed as a pair of sets gen set containing variables with upwards exposed reads in the region and kill set containing variables written in the region in phase 2 the set of live variables on entry to a region is determined from the set of live variables on exit of the region for loops containing returns and breaks the situation is somewhat complicated since there is not just a single exit a single transfer function is not sufficient to describe the behavior of a region with multiple exits in a backward data flow problem instead we summarize the behavior of a loop body by three transfer functions from loop body exit from loop exit and from enclosing procedure exit a loop is described by just two transfer functions from loop exit and from procedure exit a single transfer function still suffices to describe a procedure in other respects the analysis is straightforward saman amarasinghe mon oct 2 11 00 22 pdt 1995
