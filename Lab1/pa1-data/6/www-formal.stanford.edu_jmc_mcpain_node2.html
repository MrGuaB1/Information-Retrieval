the source language next up previous next the object language up correctness of a compiler previous introduction the source language the abstract analytic syntax of the source expressions is given by the table which asserts that the expressions comprise constants variables and binary sums that the predicates isconst isvar and issum enable one to classify each expression and that each sum e has summands s1 e and s2 e the semantics is given by the formula where val e gives the numerical value of an expression e representing a constant gives the value of the variable e in the state vector and is some binary operation it is natural to regard as an operation that resembles addition of real numbers but our results do not depend on this for our present purposes we do not have to give a synthetic syntax for the source language expressions since both the interpreter and the compiler use only the analytic syntax however we shall need the following induction principle for expressions suppose is a predicate applicable to expressions and suppose that for all expressions e we have then we may conclude that is true for all expressions e john mccarthy wed sep 29 13 40 01 pdt 1999
