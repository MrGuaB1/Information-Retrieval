data wrangler blog wrangle feedback welcome posted on feb 8 2011 at 01 48 pm we launched wrangler just a few days ago and are excited to have already received so many inquiries thanks to everyone who has shared their comments and feature requests we d like to briefly share some of our thoughts and respond to a few of the most common questions my data is big can i use wrangler and can i export my script for our alpha launch we are releasing wrangler as a client side javascript application obviously this puts some heavy limitations on the size of the input data in the future we plan to introduce a backend component that communicates with the front end to greatly improve scalability in the meantime we will soon augment the current wrangler ui to enable export of data transformation scripts for example as python or hadoop scripts so one strategy will be to paste a sub sample of your data into wrangler and then use the resulting script on your full data set what are your plans for releasing the software at this initial stage we are simply making the web application available by so doing we hope to improve the tool with user feedback prior to our next release we intend to eventually release the system as open source software my data is private can i use wrangler during this initial experimental phase we re interested in learning how wrangler is being used and we re hoping you will be willing to help to that end we are logging transformation steps and their initiating interactions column header clicks text selection ranges we do not transmit nor do we store your full pasted data set however data elements referenced within transformation steps column names and selected ranges of text are included in our log in the future we plan to release the software so you can run it standalone on your own machine can i learn more about data cleaning are there other tools to explore yes data wrangler builds on ideas published over ten years ago in the prescient potter's wheel system as well as great work in the area of programming by demonstration and wrangler is hardly the only kid on the block you might also be interested in david huynh and co s work on google refine what else is coming down the pipeline we have some research surprises cooking in the laboratory for example more advanced visualizations to help further explore and clean the data once it has been wrangled into a tabular format come back to this page from time to time for the lastest updates thanks the wrangler team sean ravi phil andreas joe and jeff 0 comment subscribe through rss 2011 stanford visualization group all rights reserved
