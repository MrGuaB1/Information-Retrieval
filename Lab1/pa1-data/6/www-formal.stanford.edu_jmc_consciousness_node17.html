relative consistency next up previous contents next inferring non knowledge up logical paradoxesgodel's theorems previous iterated self confidence relative consistency when we cannot prove a theory consistent we can often show that it is consistent provided some other theory eg peano arithmetic or zf is consistent in his godel 1940 godel proved that if godel bernays set theory is consistent then it remains consistent when the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis are added to the axioms he did this by supposing that set theory has a model ie there is a domain and an predicate satisfying gb he then showed that a subset of this domain the constructible sets provided a model of set theory in which the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis are also true paul cohen proved in 1963 that if set theory has any models it has models in which the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis are false john mccarthy mon jul 15 13 06 22 pdt 2002
